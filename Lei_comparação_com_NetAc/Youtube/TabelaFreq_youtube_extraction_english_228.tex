  \cellcolor{green!27}\small People have been slaughtering and killing each other ever since humans have existed, and sadly,  they will continue To do so.  However environmental friendly the Aborigines were in the past, and other indigenous races elsewhere, To return to their lifestyle is of course impossible and has been so for a long time.   Far too many of us for a start. The 20th Century alone saw over a dozen wars that killed over a million people,  the worst being the Second World War. And there were at least 200 that killed thousands or hundreds of thousands of people.And the persecution of races by other people continues daily - the Palestinians by Israel, the Tibetans by the Chinese Native Indians in Brazil plus \textbf{racism} and intolerance even in developed countries like the USA.  And there is not A single thing that anyone can do about it.  All this talk about 'Saving the Planet'  is just that, talk and \textbf{nothing} more. The destruction of the human \textbf{race} is inevitable and has been so for a long time.  No amount of conferences and speeches can Alter this fundamental fact. If White Australians are so concerned about the fate of the Aborigines, perhaps they could consider returning to the land Of their ancestors, whether in Britain, Europe Or elsewhere.  However, of course, this is also now totally impossible.And no White Australians can ever live the lifestyle of the Aborigines before whites arrived on the First Fleet at Botany Bay in 1788.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nothing, Race, Racism & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/248 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.21 \\  \hline

Rather than a story of aggressive white imperialists disrupting an arcadian Aboriginal people living in harmony with one another and their environment, the long term history of Australian habitation would have resembled more that of humanity at large where the stronger have pushed aside the weaker, irrespective of the colour of either side. Hence, instead of a simple moral tale of goodies and baddies, the history of this continent would have reflected more the hard reality of the human condition everywhere.''This is why today the educated but non-specialist public has no inkling that there were ever pygmies in Australia. Knowledge of their existence would pose an obvious question mark over the central doctrine of Aboriginal politics. Hence, for public consumption, politics have made the topic taboo.'\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}2/198 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.01 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small ABORIGINAL CANNIBALS.Mothers Who Eat Their Babies.To the Editor.Sir - I have written many articles on aboriginal cannibalism during the years, since 1900, when in company with, and at the invitation of the R.C. Bishop of Perth (Dr. Gibney) and Dean Martelli, of Bunbury. I visited the Beagle Bay trappist Mission. At that mission the Acting Abbot (Father Nicholas de Emo) pointed out to us a \textbf{woman} who had recently killed and eaten her newly-born infant. When I asked her how she could kill and eat her baby, she replied, 'I only ate one' and pointing to another \textbf{woman} she said, "That jandu (\textbf{woman}) ate three." I still possess the photographs of the Beagle Bay Mission women taken by myself, and among these are not only the two above mentioned, but others who also killed and ate their babies.The whole of the circumcised tribes, from Kimberley to Eucla, the Australian Bight, Ouldea, Tarcoola, and areas as far south as Ayers Rock, Mount Connor \&c., were cannibals by rite, custom, and choice. I am making this statement ‚Äî as I have made it unchallenged through the years‚Äîfrom personal knowledge of the groups within the areas mentioned . I have explained in lectures and articles the various forms of cannibalism, \&c , among the various groups. In steady, quiet, concentrated investigations extending over 27 years among the circumcised groups I have learncd the various group methods in respect of cannibalism. Some groups, as for instance, the kaalur wong-ga of a border area (South Australia-Western Australia) were cannibals by choice as well as by custom. They raided and killed, and then left their victim to be buried by his orher own group (who leave the camp of the dead immediately after burial). Returning to the spot they dug up and cooked their victim. Their "special" method consisted in cooking the victim in the position in which he was buried ‚Äî legs pressed and tied to thighs, chin resting on knees, the fore and inner arms tied together, and the hands resting near the cheeks. I have buried many in this position, as this mode of burial has a wide radius. Scientists call it the' 'three-fold position.' For eight months I nursed and tended three \textbf{blind} \textbf{old} aborigines, at my camp at Wirilya, some 20 miles north of Fowler's Bay‚Äî Jinjabula; the last \textbf{blind} \textbf{old} native of the one-time rather numerous group of Ooldea Water; Binilya, the last \textbf{blind} \textbf{old} \textbf{woman} of the group, whose waters were along Tar'kula (Tarcoola) road, Yuria Water (45 miles: north-east from Fowler's Bay): and Dau'i, a demented \textbf{old} man from War'darrgana,(the native name of Boundary Dam). Added to these was Jeerabuldara; a poor creature rotting away with disease whom I had known and tended at my Eucla camp, and who came to me over a distance of 240 miles, her relatives having abandoned her owing to her constant screams of agony. From all these I learned when and where they had eaten their last meal of "human meat." I do not ask "if they are cannibals." There is a local term in the vocabularies of all the circumcised groups for 'human meat,' and this term I quietly use when discussing the subject. Cannibalism automatically ceases on their entry into civilized areas, the instance of Nyan-ngauera killing and eating her newly-born infant within a mile of my Ooldea camp, being the only one. Her civilized women relatives had tried to dissuade her, and I had been at special pains to feed her and her family bountifully, so that hunger would not be the incentive to her horrible deed; but she did not want the baby in her new life. Every adult and boy and girl now wandering along and south of the East-West line has eaten human flesh. In the group of 26, including Nyan-ngauera, who came to my Ooldea camp in 1920, all, except the tiniest babies, had eaten human meat.There was but one man named Nyeer-dainamong all these wandering derelicts (everyone of whom I knew personally) who told me he had never tasted human meat, and his statement was confirmed by Inya-gooj, whose mother had shared several of her cooked babies with him "to make him strong."I do not like to cite particular cases; it does not seem to me to be playing the game with these dying people, whose utter need of such services as I have given them was first realized by me during my four months' stay at the Trappist Mission at Beagle Bay in 1900. In all, the years since then I have concentrated on thisone work of helping to make their passing easier.My work is entirely "hush-hush" work, and no white person, fettler's wife, farmer's wife, or station owner's wife, hasseen me at work among the sick or diseased friends round and about me; but I feel that this letter is necessary, as my personal integrity is questioned, and I hope its publication will do no injury to these poor derelicts among whom I have lived and laboured in this State since 1911.‚ÄîI am, Sir, \&c.,DAISY M.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Tanya Mcintosh I don't think all Aboriginal tribes did,...but I'm not certain about this. And I don't think any Australian Aboriginals who has grown up in modern civilised society would do this. However, cannibalism has been documented by many sources, to have been a reality in many if not most Australian Aboriginal tribes, before white man brought western civilisation to the continent.Cannibalism was documented, as being part of burial rituals, and other religious rituals. Also, as part of a custom, or tradition(perhaps religious) of eating parts of the flesh of the tribe that lost in battle. Until recently, there was an Australian Pygmy, which has disappeared. I sent a link above of how the Australian Pygmy became extinct. Long story short, it was because of war, and cannibalism as a consequence of war.There is a good chance that all people would have done something like this at some stage in the distant past, who knows? This is why it's extremely valuable to study Australian Aborigines, so we can learn more about our own distant , ancient past, tens of thousands of years ago.However, because of the different environment Europeans grew and evolved to give birth to modern civilisation. All races have some advantages and weaknesses. In modern civilisation, built by white Europeans, it's natural that this environment would be most compatible to white Europeans. Just as the outback in Australia, is more compatible to Australian Aborigines.Trying to say that white invaded into Australia doesn't make sense, as each \textbf{black} tribe that stepped onto australia did the same.If white people offer to share their inheritance (western civilisation) with Aborigines, and Aborigines spit in their face as they take advantage of all that they can .....this will not end well.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!27}1/293 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.341 \\  \hline

If im not Australian than what am I? And how do you come to this conclusion ?  And what country which I was born did my family members build and fight for in all the wars weve been too, so peace would rain through out it ? So we could live together and celibrate together our freedom. Oh and I married a \textbf{black} girl. So my kids are mixed. You know half \textbf{black} half white. So What country do they belong too? Im confused. Ive worked all my life and paid my taxes and am still working and paying my taxes contributing to my country well i think it is ? Ive never been on the dole and never asked for any handouts even when times were tough. And only been able to afford one meal a day.  So I know ive contributed to Australia and my country ? Well I was born here. What do you honestly recon ? And how does your contributions  compare to my contributions and sweat tears and blood I have spilt for my country or is it ? I dont wont a ps ing  match.  Just to let you know and other trully  indiginous peole know the injustices of the past which i had \textbf{nothing} to do with nor my parents or any of my relatives had to  anything to do with how and why does that past have anything to do with me or my children?
