  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Don't get me wrong, I do understand how annoying it must be to grow up with strict parents, but my childhood was a complete mess because of violence and a total lack of rules. I'd be out drinking on the sreets at the \textbf{age} of thirteen, \textbf{nobody} gave a damn about where I'd spend my nights. One time I got so drunk at 14 that my friends had to carry me home and just left me on my bed. I pissed myself, threw up and all - \textbf{nobody} noticed. I was so glad to have gotten away with that the next morning, now I know that I could have died that night.I've been dealing with \textbf{alcohol} abuse on and off since then, now I'm 23, got my degree and haven't had a single drop in 13 months. I love my parents and know they love me, but what they loved even more was their careers. They didn't only neglect me but also my younger siblings. When I was 14 my brothers were 3 and 5 years \textbf{old}, they often got up at night to sleep in my parent's room or to get them to bring them back to bed and say goodnight one more time. My parents didn't like that and locked their door. Since I didn't have a key for my door, my brothers would both come into my bed to be close to somebody, and I had to share it with them which kept me from sleeping. I complained about it but \textbf{nothing} changed. When all of this started to show and my grades got worse and worse, my parents would pretend that it was all my fault.I could go on telling these stories for hours and it truly sickens me. Both ends of the spectrum can be very damaging.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Nobody, Nothing, Old, alcohol & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Age - Youngsters, Behavioural Addiction - Alcohol & \cellcolor{green!5}6/304 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.974 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Parents when they were younger could survive without phones and devices because (in my case) my mom's parents weren't strict and they had no reason to be bored in their room watching Netflix and staying in their room for 6 months straight doing so  they could go out with their friends and sleepovers and hang out but what do I do \textbf{nothing} I basically live in my room and have horrible social skills I try but I can't do anything and they wonder why I have no friends and people think I'm \textbf{weird} look I'm trying but my parents are too strict and they don't realize how it's messing with my life they won't even listen to me anything I say is irrelevant to them\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nothing, Weird & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}2/125 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.6 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Honestly having strict parents is the worst since I'm an only child. I'm also an introvert (INFP) and sometimes, I honestly want to just go out with friends, I don't like being cooped up all the time, but my parents never let me go out. They wonder why I am so quiet, well it's because I'm not trying to get in trouble because everything I say gets me in trouble. I end up setting high standards for myself and it becomes unbearable. My dream is to be a veterinarian when I grow up because I love working with animals, though I have never had a pet, but my parents says school comes first. 98 of the things you learn in school aren't useful for the future; we all know that. I swear I had a \textbf{mental} breakdown after my mom found out I had Reddit and was posting because Reddit is my escape and she took my phone away, took it back but now she is home and I was working on my keyboard so she left me alone (ending here before i get in trouble)\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Mental & \cellcolor{green!27}Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}1/186 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.538 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Strict Parents are notorious for using the strawman fallacy they scapegoat everything normal as being a bad influence on their daughters this isn't "protecting" their daughters from being objectified and sexualized this is only worsening the problem Daughters are taught that standing up for themselves isn't "ladylike" and parents sugarcoat \textbf{sexual} harassment by using the excuse that boys will be boys and that girls should stay silent which are just outdated \textbf{gender} stereotypes\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender, Sexual & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/73 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.74 \\  \hline

I really wanted to hang out with my friend cuz she might move schools next year and I wanted to have the opportunity to gain the best moments of our friendship because I really do love her as my best friend and I am absolutely heart broken to hear that she's moving soon but my mom is just holding me back every single time. I just hope that one day JUST ONE DAY, she'll let me step my foot out of the house to the mall to have fun. Honestly, strict parents are one of the worst kind of parents ever cuz they don't ever understand what you're going through and then just expects you to behave like they wanted you to.

If I was out with my friends past 7 at night even in summer I had to phone her every hour so she knew what I was doing and if I missed one phone call off her I would get in trouble like I remember once I went to the toilet and had a missed call from her... apparently "almost wetting myself" wasn't a good enough excuse to miss a phone call!

Parents, if you have rules set on one child you place those rules on all your children. If one child can be out late by a certain \textbf{age} then all of them can be out late at that \textbf{age}.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small People in the comments are talking about their experience with their parents, but just wait until you become a parent yourself. You think your parents are strict on you now, but as you grow older you'll start to realize why they did what they did and really appreciate the depth of the meaning behind it. Why do you think Asians parents are mostly academic focused and strict towards their kids? It's so their kids can live a better life than they ever did. It's so they don't have to work in a restaurant or work in 100 degrees outside. That's why universities such as UC Berkeley and UCLA are nearly 50 Asians. Education is very important and it opens a lot of opportunities in our lives.On the side note, \textbf{nobody} else will sacrifice as much as our parents and tell us what to do other than our parents. The times we have with our parents now, cherish them. I'm speaking this as a 23 years \textbf{old} son, because people really don't cherish what they have until those things around them are gone forever.  Our parents gave us everything and did their best. As they grow older, it's our turn to return the favor and protect them and look out for them. Be glad that we even have parents.

This is because I do not have permission to sleep before 10:30 pm and 10am unless I am vomiting.I don't even have a curfew. I am only allowed out of the house every couple of months (except for school \& working for them) and when I am, I have to constantly update my mother on whenever I enter or exit any building before it happens. This is because she will come pick me up whenever she feels like it. I haven't seen a friend outside school since October and haven't had a friend over my house since last April, but I'm told I see them too often. Even now, just a little short of 18 years \textbf{old}, my mommy has to meet my friend's mommy before I am allowed to hang out with them as if I am a child who doesn't recognize good people from bad.I also do way more chores than everyone I know and get called lazy (while my brother who plays video games all day and does no chores gets praised as a hard worker).Clothing, I can't wear what I want (which is the opposite of inappropriate). I have to fight for jeans + shirts or my mom will make me wear a blouse every day. And not even a nice blouse, she wants me to dress like a 70 year \textbf{old} accountant on a daily basis.I've never snuck out of the house, I do my best to obey my parents' orders (but some things they ask of me are literally impossible for any human to do), and I am always rewarded with 'you're so lazy' and 'you don't even try to be a good daughter', or, if they're really mad, 'our lives would be so much better if you were not around' and 'your rebelliousness ruins the lives of everyone around you'.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}2/356 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.562 \\  \hline

Although, there would be times that other kids were allowed to do certain things that we weren't allowed to do. One thing is they would always get too bent out of shape if we wrote on ourselves with pen or markers. They have a passionate disdain for tattoos, which lingers with me. It causes me difficulties because many of my friends have tattoos, and it's awkward for me when they talk about tattoos. They also tended to overreact if we had \textbf{g\textbf{ay}}/bisexual friends or they suspected us of being \textbf{g\textbf{ay}}.
