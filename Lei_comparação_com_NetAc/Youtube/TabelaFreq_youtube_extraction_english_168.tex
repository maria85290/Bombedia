\hline\cellcolor{green!27}\small I am exceedingly happy to nice to \textbf{old} people; the \textbf{disabled} and kids. At one point in my life, I was young and \textbf{disabled} and I will be \textbf{old}; thus needing someone's generosity but plan and simple kindness. If you do a good thing then surely it will come back to you. Most importantly, we should have good humanity towards all living creatures. However if it is not in you to give then God will take care of it, one way or another. The references to the brother in a negative way is just not nice nor fair on the basis that he is trying hard to be a beacon of higher self for our \textbf{race} of people. If truth be told this is who we are since the beginning of time!!! I agree completely in what he is teaching and showing for all to see. Even if you still disagree, why can't be just try harder to make a positive difference to another human being?\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Disabled, Old, Race & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}4/166 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.41 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Funny you should mention that...Mexico doesnt have a lot of social programs like the U.S. there is no social security check when you get \textbf{old}.. you will see older people bagging groceries, working a parking lot guards, yard service, house helpers, and selling small goods to make enough to get by...I remember that his one man used to ride his bike at night and blow a whistle as he did....turns out he was the "neighborhood watchman"...he does his bit at night then he goes around in the day and knocks on doors and asks for "donations"...from money to maybe food or whatever for his services...\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}1/105 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.952 \\  \hline
