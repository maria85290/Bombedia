  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I'd say..(1) Too much consumption of animal products.  Throw a couple of eggs and a dead chicken on a Las Vegas sidewalk in June.  Wait five hours.  Not a good smell.  (2) Not enough bathing.  \textbf{Old} people should bath every day.  For various reasons, they generally don't.   (3)  More soap.  I use a couple of scrubs brushes, with soap, when showering.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Hmmm. Would oil-based cleansers break it down?

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Getting older is garbage. There is just \textbf{nothing} good to look forward to about it.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Yeah, yeah, yeah, that all sounds good and scientific, but more than likely it is because older people do not bathe or wash their cloths as often, thus giving more time for your explanation to have its affect.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I love that you acknowledged that people have different reactions to this smell and that there are good reasons why.  My friend absolutely hates it-- she says it reminds her of her grandpa's miserable last days in a nursing home, and she's very afraid of aging (one of those "I hope I die before I get very \textbf{old}" people).  I was semi-raised by my grandma and I absolutely love the smell; sometimes I find myself feeling really relaxed or comforted on a public train and then I realize it's because there's an \textbf{old} person near by and they smell good.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I think it's a genetic/pheromone thing.  I was born in South Africa, and noticed that the \textbf{African} Americans in America have the same scent as the native Africans in my home country.  It's not bad, it's just different.  Sort of musky, I guess?  While it may be partially due to diet, I think the diet of native Africans and \textbf{African} Americans differs quite significantly, while the scent is the same.  All people have their own smell, and especially when you visit their house, you notice everyone's home has their own unique smells.  It depends on your genes, and the scents are mostly to discourage inbreeding.  Evolutionarily, almost all mammals prefer breeding with another individual with a moderate difference in genetic makeup - not too similar (inbreeding) but not too dissimilar either.  As for the change in the smell of a \textbf{woman}, it's due to hormones - hormones are released in the skin all the time, and bacteria on your skin breaks them down into certain volatile compounds.  Since a \textbf{woman}'s hormones changes depending on her cycle, her scent will change as well.  Cortisol also changes scent, and menstruation is more stressful than non-menstruation, so extra cortisol is released.  I think all women probably have slightly different scents depending on their cycle, but the degree of the change might just not be high enough for you to notice them with everyone.And for the foods, certain compounds in foods, especially foods high in sulfur like garlic and onions can come out through your sweat glands, where bacteria break them down into volatile compounds that you can smell.  The exception being East Asians, who lack the gene for the large sweat gland variant, so they only have the smaller sweat glands that are too small for most smelly chemicals to be released through.  That's why East Asians don't typically need to wear deodorant, and very rarely smell bad.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/316 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.949 \\  \hline

Noticable from quite long distances like a perfume, but something more \textbf{unrefined} and earthy than that. Like a herb, oil or tree sap.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small RoarOfDamnation I notice it for a handfull of women, but I never paid attention to it/realised it until I met an extreme case. I probably got hyperosmia. My nose is unusually keen and I overreact to a few smells. For instance, if someone is sweaty, I can smell it from up to 10m. This hypersensitivity to some smells  can result in sneezing or even vomiting in rare cases. In my case, I had a colleague and she had a very recognisable scent. For some time I couldn't smell her and then she started to smell a bit like those spice spiked oranges some have at home, just a bit more aromatic. First I thought it was just a \textbf{weird} perfume, but then I noticed that it occurred semi regularly and always shifted to a smell reminiscent of moist furr and raw meat getting smoked and for about three days she smelled horribly of smoke. During that time, I would be able to smell her a minute after she walked by. Her office smelt of her for at least 6h after she left. I asked others but they never noticed it, so I thought I was going insane. Still, it was so strong that I would sneeze, if she got too close and I really wondered about how often she washed herself. I developped the creepy habit of greeting her by her name before I could actually see her. I never said it without later seeing her, so it could hardly be only imagination that I was able to smell her around corners and through doors. In one case I was looking for my colleagues on a Christmas market, which was very crowded and full of smells, yet the first thing I noticed was her smell before I could see or hear any of my colleagues, so I actually tried to track her and it worked. I was so close to complain about her hygiene since she really upset my nose in proximity.The funny thing: later a colleague told me that he could tell when another coworker had her period due to her smell, but I could hardly smell it in her case and he could not smell what I could smell either.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Weird & \cellcolor{green!27}Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}1/373 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.268 \\  \hline
