  \cellcolor{green!5}\small We are all human and are capable of treating each other with respect. We don't need to subscribe to notions of \textbf{nationalism} nor do we need to sympathize with the supremacy of certain races/ethnic group. Apartheid was one of the worst disasters that human beings decided to partake in. We don't even need \textbf{race} to justify hate amongst each other. We can just say that they're from a different tribe or from another \textbf{nation}. Perhaps they follow the wrong political party. A popular finger-pointer for sure is religion.

\textbf{\Large Result analysis:}

\begin{itemize}\item Taking into account the words that were detected, we can reach the conclusion these comments are associated with : : Ethnicity - Black;Ethnicity - General;Age - Youngsters;Age - Over 65s;Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments;Nationality - General;Social Class - Working class;Ethnicity - Native-American; Ideological and Political Identity - General;Sexual Identity - General;Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality;Physical Identity - Physical Features;Gender - General;Age - General;Religious Identity - Muslim;Ethnicity - Asian (South- India, Pakistan, Bangladesh);Nationality - Hispanic;Nationality - British;Gender - Female sexuality;%.

\item The percentage of hate speech related words is 3.7671.

\item Considering that the variable \textbf{Ethnicity - General} has the most occurences in the post, we can interpret that this is the predominant hate speech.

\item Overall there were 844/1332 occurences of hate speech related comments.\end{itemize}\end{document}
