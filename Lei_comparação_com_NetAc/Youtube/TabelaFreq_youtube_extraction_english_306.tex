  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Religion is stronger than \textbf{nationalism}. The myth of god and deities is infinite and borderless, unlike the myth of the \textbf{nation}, which is limited to its own pre-defined identity and political boundaries. This is why Islam and Christianity are spread globally, and even extra-terrestrials could adopt any of these faiths.Also, while \textbf{nationalism} always ends up becoming a religion (a cult of the \textbf{nation}, even \textbf{Nation}-State), religion can transcend everything even existence itself, making fanatics  not only kill and die for the \textbf{nation}, but do it for the promise of an after-life.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nation, Nationalism & \cellcolor{green!5}Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}5/92 & \cellcolor{green!5}5.435 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The myth of the \textbf{Nation} didn't exist back then, only the republic. The \textbf{Nation} in Europe is a product of 17th century totalitarianism, and 18th century reformist republican movements.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nation & \cellcolor{green!5}Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/29 & \cellcolor{green!5}6.897 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small You're confusing communitarianism with \textbf{nationalism}. The modern nation-state with it's ideas of sovereignty and identity didn't exist during classical antiquity. There was a shared conception of being 'Greek' however, but this was by no means a unifying conception; the Greeks were broken into various city-states (which for Aristotle was the highest form of community).Geller correctly points out it wasn't until the early industrial \textbf{age} that the notions of sovereignty, equal citizenship and national identity began to arise.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Nationalism & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/78 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.564 \\  \hline

Look at Germany and Italy who put ideology over \textbf{ethnicity} in WW2 vs England which put \textbf{ethnic} identity above any economic or political ideology.We need homogenous nations to create a moral and peaceful world.And lastly this video, as another commenter mentioned, says \textbf{nothing} about the pre-modern \textbf{ethnic} based states.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Common, Ethnic, Ethnicity, Nationalism, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - General, Nationality - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}8/100 & \cellcolor{green!27}8.0 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small DC \textbf{ethnic} identity creates an ideological mind . A mind traped within its past assumptions therefore an individual that cannot be within the present. He self creates or self replicates the very authoritarian institutions he hates. But now they manifest themselves as idea constructs. Finally unable to break out of ones very minds due to the lack of tools for ideological freedom he must resort to myths to tales of the subconscious. Its the ultimate trade. The man trades all his problems for one singular problems.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Nani The Chaman \textbf{Ethnic} identity is what combats ideology.  For example prioritizing blood over ideology prevents the extremes of ideology taking root.  For example Armenian communists and anti-communists came together to fight Muslims.  Obviously prioritizing blood over ideology allowed them to defend against this evil.   The Soviet Union atrocities would not have happened if \textbf{ethnic}Russians were in charge.  85 were Jewish and the rest like Lenin were mostly either half Jews or married to Jews.  Without Jews the gulags would have never occurred.  The Soviet Union only started to change when the last non-Russian - Stalin- died and Russians came into control.Heidegger makes a similar argument in Being and Time about how for the truth to be revealed the individual must be placed in the context ofan \textbf{ethnic} group and history etc.  History has shown awareness of ones \textbf{ethnicity} and racialconsciousness is the surest defense against authoritarian structures.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnic, Ethnicity & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}4/152 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.632 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Jetpack Rorschach \textbf{Ethnic} identity is a biological drive as natural as the need to develop myths to reveal biological archetypes.What you call obsession is intellectual integrity to biological imperative - a dedication to use myth to reveal truths about ournature.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnic & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/42 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.381 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Hans Olo To day that the English didn't have a strong tribal identity is dishonest.  I would argue that Germany would have been better off putting tribal identity over fascist ideology.  Dedication to ideology is what destroyed Germany.  In fact Fascism as described by Mussolini was dedication to the state being prioritized over everything including \textbf{ethnic} identity.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnic & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/57 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.754 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small If you have a valid point, why do you use unsupported statements to try to make it? Statements 1\&2.As far as your sentiment toward archetypes goes, they are universal you fuckwit. Culture and \textbf{ethnicity} have \textbf{nothing} to with archetypes outside of local mythology.

\textbf{\Large Result analysis:}

\begin{itemize}\item Taking into account the words that were detected, we can reach the conclusion these comments are associated with : : Gender - General;Ethnicity - General;Nationality - General;Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments;Age - Youngsters;Age - General;Social Class - Working class; Ideological and Political Identity - General;%.

\item The percentage of hate speech related words is 2.6208.

\item Considering that the variable \textbf{Ethnicity - General} has the most occurences in the post, we can interpret that this is the predominant hate speech.

\item Overall there were 51/66 occurences of hate speech related comments.\end{itemize}\end{document}
