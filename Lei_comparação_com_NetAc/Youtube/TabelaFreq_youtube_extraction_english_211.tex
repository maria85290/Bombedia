  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Seems like a good idea. I'm white and I don't want to meet someone who isn't white. Not because of \textbf{racism}, but when I find the one, I want her to be white so my children look like me. I wouldn't want to have children with a \textbf{black} or Asian \textbf{woman} because my children wouldn't have my characteristics, I mean someone who was Persian or Argentinan/Chilean would be okay (I've had a Argentinian girlfriend before) but that would be a big concern for me if I met someone that I could spend the rest of my life with. I bet a lot of people only want to meet people of their same \textbf{race}. I find white women the most attractive too. I don't find \textbf{black} or south-east Asian women attractive. So having a site where I can only meet white women would be perfect! I may sign up.The fact where white people meet is controversial is disgusting. There is \textbf{black}, Latino, Asian only sites that have no controversy, when white people want to have their own its \textbf{racist}. This is a bad sign.That \textbf{woman} that says that white people can't meet each other is wrong. I've had trouble finding a nice traditional \textbf{woman}. And it's perfectly fine to only date within your own \textbf{race}. I only really date within my \textbf{race}. I would possibly be open to a Asian or South American \textbf{woman}. But I don't really find certain races generally attractive, and that's fine. I'm perfectly fine with being friends with people of any races, I've got friends who are Chinese, Korean, Guatemalan, Fillipino, Malayan, \textbf{Indian}, Pakistani (one of my best friends is white/Pakistani mixed) and I know a \textbf{black} guy too. But dating and relationships is a total different thing to having friends. I wouldn't have any problem with anyone of any \textbf{race} only wanting to date within their own \textbf{race}. It's natural. Forcing people to date outside their \textbf{race} because of some modern progressive ideas of everything being \textbf{racist} is just foul. That \textbf{woman} that had a problem with is seems like she would have some far-out disgusting opinions on \textbf{race}. Definitely a member of the modern progressive far-left intelligentsia. Anyway God bless all of you, especially those who read my long comment. I hope everyone finds the man/\textbf{woman} of their dreams. I've got my hopes up to meet a nice traditional \textbf{woman} who would like to have a family and lead a simple life with me. But finding a \textbf{woman} like that is a hard thing these days! Especially a young \textbf{woman} as I'm 24! Most women these days just want to go out on the town, do pretty degenerate things. Especially after a drink. I love a drink my self, but I hate bars and especially clubs. Proper dens of iniquity. I certainly don't want a \textbf{woman} who leads that kind of lifestyle. A lot of women jump to \textbf{sex} way too fast too. A \textbf{woman} who would open her legs on the first date, and women who open their legs before your in a proper relationship are to be avoided like the plague. Where are all the nice women, with morals at?\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Indian, Race, Racism, Racist, Sex, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Ethnicity - Native-American, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}26/530 & \cellcolor{green!5}4.906 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Racism is real, but this isn't it.  I'm sorry if someone likes \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} heads or females with natural hair, or if women like tall guys....... that is just what they like. Most \textbf{black} people are attracted to \textbf{black} people and the same goes to whites. Most Nigerians marry Nigerians, most Polish marry Polish. So are they wrong for not seeking love outside of the \textbf{ethnic} groups they come from also. Dating is hard and most people who are serious about finding someone for a real relationship what to cut through all the people online who just want to hookup and play games. They get laser focused on what they want, what works and get aggressive. Look at 'Out Time' those people are looking to meet people the same \textbf{age}. They aren't saying they hate you g people. Most people have tried to date outside of their \textbf{race}, \textbf{age} and religion. Sometimes is works and sometimes they find out they want what they're parents had so to speak.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small You have a lot of WP saying 'leave the past in the past when it comes to racism'.   It's so easy for them to say this because they are STILL BENEFITING from what their Ancestors did to our Ancestors. Why do you think White Supremacy and White Privilege STILL exist?  Look at the media, movies, magazines, marketing and advertisement. Who do you see them PROMOTING more than anyone?  They still make it seem as though being a pale face is the 'be all to end all'. Why do you see so many BM thinking of WW as a trophy and their own women as the booby prize? When in actuality, truth be told, they may be a CONSOLATION prize but BW are the GRAND PRIZE. We have survived and been through things that would have destroyed MOST of them. Like I said they are STILL BENEFITING from the pain, misery and suffering OUR Ancestors went through. They still get way more and Better OPPORTUNITIES and PRIVILEGES that they did NOT EARN, they still dominate the world, they are accurately represented in the media and movies, whereas as BP are depicted as criminals, drug addicts, trashy, etc‚Ä¶.Think about the political arena. One \textbf{Black} President in comparison to how many White ones?  Other races don't control the Government, Federal Reserve, IRS, Congress, States, Banks, schools, or the legal system. Look into the Fortune 500 Companies and tell me who are the MAJORITY CEO's, CFO's, Presidents, etc‚Ä¶. It's the ones who are STILL Benefiting from what was done to MY ANCESTORS. When WP see a police officer they see someone who is on THEIR side. Can BP say the same? WP have the privilege of not being judged, white kids can be outside playing with a gun and not get shot, if WP were in a time machine, they can go anywhere in time and it would be awesome for them. It is EASIER in America to be white. Do WP benefit from the color of their skin‚Ä¶.Of course!   Why? Again, because of our Ancestors.   This is why it will NEVER be left in the past. When you see more brown, dark and \textbf{black} skin women in the media, movies, magazines, etc. being represented ACCURATELY‚Ä¶and I'm not talking about average looking Ebony women‚Ä¶I'm talking about our FINEST and most GLAMOROUS Ebony women, then the healing will BEGIN. That's just a part of the RESTITUTION they OWE EW. Just because WW layup with \textbf{black} men DOES NOT mean they like \textbf{black} women. BM are already receiving their RESTITUTION from the WW.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Wait.

And that white \textbf{woman} says "for whatever reason, people think it's ok to say you only want to date white people" acting like that's \textbf{weird}? The average looking \textbf{black} \textbf{woman} is angry because no one responds to her profile? Seriously? Maybe because people like what they like? There are cultural issues at play here and you can't rule get angry with others because they're not attracted to you. Unless you're going to force \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} men to date women, Muslims to date Jews, Atheists to date Evangelicals and Blacks to date the very tiny minority of white supremacists. \textbf{Black} women have a bad reputation for being loud, easily angered, and not treating men very well. These are the reasons given by \textbf{black} men for not wanting to date \textbf{black} women. Whitening men and women have said that when they have dated \textbf{black} women or men, the first time they were brought home to meet the family, they were pulled off to the side and essentially told that this wasn't going to work out and they didn't want any white people in their family. Asians are very serious about arranged marriages especially in India, and dating within their own culture. You can't force this type of thing, love and attraction are very personal. There is \textbf{nothing} at all wrong with people segregating when they want to date, fall in love get married and have children. Many people are attracted to people outside of their \textbf{race} and culture, but that comes naturally, not because they're told they're "\textbf{racist}" if the aren't attracted to someone from another culture or different skin tone. Just like it's not \textbf{homophobic} for a straight man not to want to date a \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} man, heterophobic for the opposite. Come ON, this nonsense has to end.

It's the same as discriminating/rejecting people from a job just because they aren't "white"."You understand how the theory of mate choice selection works right? (just a hint, it's biological and inherent...)"Incorrect. Plenty of studies that prove most of your attraction/preferences are conditioned through the environment you grew up in. Saying that you're not attracted to Asians is a \textbf{racist} statement in itself. You cannot claim that about the millions of people you don't know and haven't seen. They don't all look the same. You can be a good person, not be \textbf{racist} and still think or say \textbf{racist} things. Attraction is conditioned and it takes guts and a lot of introspection to see and admit in oneself.Speaking on the "not everyone looks the same", how do you classify one as "white"? Is fair skin enough to pass off as white? What about someone from a different \textbf{ethnicity} who grew up in "white culture" (Whatever that means), with the same values pass off as "white"? I have seen chineese, indians and many others who share what you deem as "Eurocentric features" that makes them indistinguishable from "whites". It's one of the many reasons why the whole concept of dividing people on the basis of "races" is absurd because biologically speaking, we share more in \textbf{common} with each other and thus, "races" don't exist.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small ‚Äã DarthVader  Hah, so now you are using the ad-homs?  Even after having a go at the other guy for that?...typical, back flipping and hypocrisy. I have a feeling it will be your hallmark.Either way, lets not play coy, I work in the social science field.  I know as well as you do that the studies you are spouting are extremely small scale, rely on using specific parameters to the studies, and plenty of loaded questions in the process.  They are generally on less than 1000 people and are meaningless.  Go look at Pew or a reputable source and tell me I am wrong.  They have worldwide stats for this, so I'm not wasting time on your meaningless stats.  They are in no way applicable to a wider scale of the world let alone a larger \textbf{nation} and in fact, there are many studies, as many if not more suggesting the opposite to your little "entirely socialisation" argument.  It is held by a very small and select people in the field who are generally very fringe and picked up by idiots not in the field who think they know what they are talking about.  I believe you called them "armchair    ", making you an armchair social scientist.That aside, you are talking entirely about equity, not equality.  Equality would be to allow them to have their own dating sites so everyone has the same access to both multiracial and same racial groups if they like....which all exist, so problem solved... where is the inequality? oh I see, you aren't talking about equality of opportunity, you are talking about equality of OUTCOME..... that's equity, not equality....I suspected you were a sneaky \textbf{communist}.  You see, you cannot dictate to people how they choose to express themselves, as that actually is a right, unlike your made up "the right to love" which is sickening in itself considering that would include people like Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Polpot, Osama Bin Ladin, etc all of which you believe have the same "right to love".  Love is a developed emotion similar to trust, it's earned and developed, not owed or deserved.  So explain to me, how my emotional expression is a resource that you feel you are allowed to allocate?  I mean anyone with half a brain could see the problems with what you are suggesting before even adding the layer of complexity \textbf{race} brings. Using your logic, love is a right, therefore there is a need to have enough for everyone who feels they need it.  So what happens when there is 1 single person left who wants to be single and someone who is single but wants a relationship and they are the last 2 people available?  Does the one who is not in a relationship now have to give up being single as they want to be, to provide that love and relationship to the person who feels they are missing out?  What if one is a sociopath and can't feel love, then are they meant to pretend they do?  So now add the complexities of the inherent genetic and cultural pressures to the mix and its completely unworkable because you are trying to redistribute love like some sort of fucked up relationship \textbf{communist}.  It's like you actually believe the line "there is someone for everyone".  Funny how I am able to express that without \textbf{race} being the factor as to WHY it's a problem.  Completely shatters your idea that its racially focused, or based on inequality, inequity maybe, but inequality...not at all.  You are actually upset that even when the same opportunity is presented, the numbers still fall how they do and you want to blame us for that... it's your own shortcoming.  If anything it has to do with culture, but that in no way implicates the whites by default either, another thing you were quick to suggest.  As mentioned earlier, to tackle this one you need to square off with the issue of Chinese and Indians preferring whites to Africans as well even without the "eurocentric" sphere of influence, which to do you would have to admit that it has to do with choice somewhere along the line as you can chose which culture you adopt.  This ruins your entire narrative that they are victims of circumstance, because they actually had agency in the process, unlike ACTUAL \textbf{racism}.In the current climate, every \textbf{race} is taking their opportunity to have a go at whites as it is in fashion at the moment, why would the whites then want to date those people insulting them and their culture?  You are basically saying that all races can act however they want to whites and exclude them when they feel like it, and if whites then due to how they are treated decide they would like to have their own group (like every other \textbf{race} is allowed to) its \textbf{racist} and discriminatory.

I said from the start it can be A factor, but you cant assert it as THE factor or reason.  You are trying as hard as you can to suggest that you can make that jump consistently, when it's obvious you cannot.  You really are trying hard, that's just piss weak though.  Stop trying to backtrack and admit you are wrong, it makes you look way worse.   Also it's embarassing you used the Doll test, from 1954.  Something that did not even have a control group.  Thats pathetic and has been shot down endlessly since. "According to Kenneth Clark's analysis, the doll studies were relevant in that they showed how racial segregation interfered with students' personality development. But Harvard law professor Lani Guinier has noted (pdf) that the Clarks' conclusions failed to consider that \textbf{black} students with high degrees of contact with whites could very possibly have experienced even greater distress over their racial stigma than their counterparts in segregated communities. Plus, plenty of commentators have pointed out that the experiment included a small sample size and no control group."Yeah, seems real legit.  Thats just one, I can show plenty more reasons it's a load of shit if you like.  Since you are the master social scientist here i'm sure you are aware a source from 64 years ago is hardly credible on that basis alone...Stop making my points for me.  Like I said, it's cultural, not racial.  Like I said, a culture can be attached to a \textbf{race} (stereotyping) but a \textbf{race} doesn't HAVE to follow a certain culture, they have the agency to choose.  Something you do not give other races credit for.  The exposure experiment has to do with exposure to cultures you moron, not \textbf{race}.  \textbf{Race} is skin colour and \textbf{ethnic} background, not culture, the stigma doesn't come from the skin colour, it comes from the culture and behaviour associated with that skin colour.  You are asserting they do not have a choice again.  The only actors who can change that stigma is those within it since as I mentioned, our rights end when they begin to step on those of others, like their choice of expression...  Do I need to explain this?  It proves exactly what I'm saying.  Yes, you can get used to other cultures with more contact, doesn't mean there is an increase in meaningful relationship developed within them.  It's like saying you can get used to living with one kidney.  Sure, is it preferable, to death, yes, to two kidneys, no.  These fail to have any prediction power as they are short term, another thing I already mentioned, so you cannot predict based off of them, any REAL social scientist would understand that, it's estimations...  "It's called "exposure effect" and it's currently in line with the rise in interracial marriages with the rise in multiculturalism. The more people get exposed to it, the more likelihood of being open to it.".... so explain white flight.... the mass migration of whites from certain areas the more multicultural they become, because it also correlates with an increase of crime.  The reason is again not the \textbf{race} of the people, its the change in culture they bring... what is so hard to grasp?

The onus is on the disagreeing party to debunk the claim showing a control group is relevant to bring about a significant change in results. Anyone can disagree with any study saying these variables do effect, but unless they prove it, their opinion holds no merit. There's a reason why his studies were taken into consideration by the U.S supreme Court that determined racial segregation was unconstitutional. His work was not only recognized by supreme Court but many other institutions who bestowed him with honorary titles.And Lani's critique on the "level of distress \textbf{black} students experience with higher contact with whites" completely overlooks the varying levels of power both groups hold in society. Why do they experience this distress? Because having been segregated for so long and coming into contact with a group that holds the institutional, structural and social advantage, distress is inevitable but as time goes on, racial tensions lessen, as evidenced by the recent studies showing how \textbf{race} relations are perceived more positively as a society becomes more multicultural.While cultural differences do shape ones preferences, the root cause, however, starts from the moment they are born, as evidenced by the recent studies with babies showing that their biases were shaped even before they became mature enough to differentiate cultural differences between groups( or are you suggesting 4 months \textbf{old} are smart enough to recognize cultural differences in other 4 month \textbf{old} babies too?)"The findings are said to be a result of the overwhelming exposure infants have to their own \textbf{race}, and experts have warned it is wise to introduce children to people from a variety of races before the issues deepen."That alone rebutts your argument that it's about culture and not skin color and other features.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Old, Race & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}5/333 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.502 \\  \hline

Whites always had the structural, political and social advantage( to some degree even today) that they were barely represented in media. \textbf{Racism} becomes a social disease when it systematically places one \textbf{race} at the top of a hierarchy at the expense of other races. That is why the N-word stings so much more than any word blacks ever coined to denigrate white people. It's why blackface hurts in a way that whiteface doesn't.

Because Straight people aren't a marginalised group as compared to \textbf{L\textbf{G\textbf{BT}}} group."In Hollywood, \textbf{racism} has historically worked in favor of white actors. They rule the hierarchy. Peele's dedication to a different cause may cost a few white actors leading roles, but it's a twist made necessary by a caste system created by whites to benefit whites.That's why \textbf{black} entertainers deserve the BET Awards and the NAACP Image Awards. It's why \textbf{black} music producers create hip-hop and R\&B. It's why \textbf{black} authors write \textbf{black} literature. It's why \textbf{black} publishers launch \textbf{black} magazines. In an entertainment industry controlled largely by straight white men, minorities and other underrepresented groups, like women, need to celebrate themselves or risk going unrecognized.The reason why the current surge in \textbf{black} directors is so important is because they finally are telling \textbf{black} stories rather than leaving it up to white directors who, when they get around to telling them, rarely seem to get it quite right. (See the recent outrage over Peter Farrelly's 'Green Book.')

Should they be considered sexist.Secondly, what of the situation of \textbf{age}, should I have to consider every \textbf{age} equally? Of course not for many clear reasons. My point being that we set parameters to fit what we are looking for and bc no one has the time to search through all the people on this earth. \textbf{Race} is just another aspect of a person that some people look at and weigh against all other parts of that person. I personally didnt care what \textbf{race} my gf was when I asked her out but say if I did value \textbf{race} highly why because of the culture or how it makes me feel why shouldn't I get to choose that for myself.

Same reason why there are still many majority \textbf{black} schools because of socio economic  unequalities. Infact, segregation has gotten worse than before, and we're witnessing the same pattern of attitudes in the dating realm."First off are people wrong to prefer the same or opposite \textbf{sex} and as such not give them equal consideration. Should they be considered sexist"False equivalence. Do I need to go into the physiological differences between attraction towards a particular \textbf{sexual} orientation and preferences within one \textbf{sexual} orientation? It's not the same simply because attraction to a \textbf{sexual} orientation is hard wired into one's biology whereas preferences within a \textbf{sexual} orientation is often developed over time because of cultural bias/beauty standards in one's society. This is a scientifically proven phenomenon. Babies aren't born with a predisposition for a particular set of physical features, they are conditioned over time from the surrounding. FACT\textbf{Age} shouldn't be a factor as long as both are mutually consenting \textbf{age}. Irrelevant argument in this topic."My point being that we set parameters to fit what we are looking for and bc no one has the time to search through all the people on this earth. \textbf{Race} is just another aspect of a person that some people look at and weigh against all other parts of that person."True. But that's exactly what stereotyping is. Basically, by associating certain set of physical traits to certain behaviours, you're judging and forming preconceived notions before even meeting them. It's not only unfair to the person being judged, but unfair to you because you might be missing out on someone who would otherwise be a good match.Racists hold on to this argument claiming it makes their life simple because they are lazy and it requires low effort critical thinking. Employers hiring people for a job can use the same argument to justify why they picked whites over minorities by looking at their names saying "\textbf{black} people have low IQ, and predisposition for violence, so better avoid \textbf{black} sounding names"See?

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@DarthVader I will start by contesting the idea that segregation is worse than before. There most definitely is undeniable cases of systemic oppression but in no way can that be compared to days of slavery or even precivil rights. With that said let's get back to the arguement at hand. Under your logic in a perfect world everyone in the world, or even just the US for that matter, should use a single dating website. The reason this doesn't happen and why blacks have their own and is ok to you is bc we make it hard for them. But tell me if all the white people are being taken bc that is the preferred beauty standard then wouldnt that only leave POC. This then in essence would then become a \textbf{black} only website with the added bonus of leaving an opportunity for multicultural mingling. The only way to then justify \textbf{race} specific sites is though physical prefrences which I'm okay with. If you dont say that's fine then you would have to admit that those sites are more exclusionary than an all inclusive site and therefore \textbf{racist}. I will concede that \textbf{sexual} orientation is innate and will meet you on the idea that prefrences with in \textbf{sexual} orientation is different.  Again I will bring up \textbf{age} as I do not believe it is as irrelevant to this argument as you wish it was. For starters the \textbf{age} of consent as well as what \textbf{age} range is usually sought after is culturally based. Tho I too say I dont care who you date as long as its between consenting adults. The reason being that I dont care what physical prefrences you have as long as its between consenting adults. Whether it be \textbf{age}, height, eye color, amount of hair or even \textbf{race}. On any of these traits I think you have a right to decide what you prefer and make choices based off that. Even if that preference comes from a cultural background. To add to this arguement it is \textbf{common} people to look for a partner that is similar to them. Whether that be physically, personality wise, culturally or any other means in which to compare. Next onto you point of stereotyping. So far I believe you are the only one holding any preconceptions as even under your definition of stereotyping I have yet to assume one personality trait or behavior associated with being white or \textbf{black}. Only saying that physical attraction is a thing and because this is different for everyone we have no right to judge their prefrences or tell them they are wrong for having them. If you are a good person then you will make friends despite physical characteristics (this works both for white and \textbf{black} individuals) but a romantic relationship also holds physical interests which is usually how you distinguish between a friends/family and a person you are dating. This again is why we should respect a person's free choice on this aspect of their life. Also to make clear there is a huge difference between this and an employer or college admissions actually discriminating. For one the example you gave does stereotype and is not an isolation on an individuals thought on another individuals physical appearance as is the case when considering attractiveness in dating. Also as mentioned before the physical aspect plays into a romantic relationship but physical appearance does not impact the merit of an individual and as such should not be considered by employers or admissions. This has been seen in court rulings in the effort to increase equality between the races. In addition you directly assert \textbf{racist} hold this Implying that only \textbf{racist} hold this view but both white and \textbf{black}, male and female tend to date and have a preference for dating same \textbf{race}. To equate this natural part of dating people similar to ourselves to \textbf{racism} would put the label of \textbf{racist} on the majority of \textbf{black}, white and all other races for that matter. I doubt even you meant to say this and as such should reconsider that statement given the facts on dating habits.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Black, Common, Race, Racism, Racist, Sexual & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}20/689 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.903 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Tristen Flory "But tell me if all the white people are being taken bc that is the preferred beauty standard then wouldnt that only leave POC.

If the platform provides an opportunity for "multicultural mingling", then that's enough reason why there shouldn't be white exclusive sites."The only way to then justify \textbf{race} specific sites is though physical prefrences which I'm okay with"Again, still not a logical justification. Especially when ya"ll still pick the people with white features anyway regardless of exclusionary or inclusive."If you dont say that's fine then you would have to admit that those sites are more exclusionary than an all inclusive site and therefore \textbf{racist}."Non sequitur. Your argument doesn't follow from the previous statement. Any site that excludes people based on \textbf{race}/\textbf{ethnicity}/their physical characteristics is \textbf{racist}. No amount of \textbf{mental} gymnastics is going to refute this fact regardless of whether inclusive sites are \textbf{racist} or not. The fact that they get the least matches obviously has an element of \textbf{racism} at play, but since they still get an opportunity for multicultural mingling, that's enough reason to provide them a space, not make it harder by excluding them completely. That'll only make it more \textbf{racist} than the inclusive ones. \textbf{Age} has \textbf{nothing} to do in our discussion of \textbf{racist} preferences. For one, there's wide range of preferences for all kind of ages( as long as they aren't too young nor too \textbf{old}), and aren't as narrow as \textbf{race} preferences. It's the reason why you don't hear \textbf{Ageism} in media as severe as \textbf{racism} because \textbf{Ageism} only comes into the picture when \textbf{age} becomes significant enough to be discriminated, whereas \textbf{racism} affects every non whites regardless of their \textbf{age}. Apples to oranges.Next onto my point of stereotyping. I have experimented with enough dating profiles to know stereotyping is a thing, more so subconscious than conscious one that dominates over the physical aspect. For example - I had a friend who was Middle Eastern, he consistently used to get matches because of his "white features" but the moment women( especially white women), get to know he's middle eastern origin, they block/unmatch him immediately. This is no one incident, I've experimented with several profiles varying different features of one's profile to know the level of stereotyping that exists. This is a FACT.My employer analogy is no different here. In both cases, the said person was discriminating based on stereotypes associated with \textbf{ethnicity}( which to some extend can be discerned from physical appearances). This is exactly the reason why minorities change their name to a white sounding name to avoid discrimination. It's a real thing. I've noticed the same effects when I changed my name to white name on daring sites. You see, there are so many variables at play besides the physical.On the last part, Multiple studies have shown a strong correlation with people who hold \textbf{racist} views/bias with racial preferences. This is an irrefutable fact. It has also been shown it is mainly growing up in a society that prioritises white beauty standards as the benchmark of attractiveness.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Tristen Flory It has also been shown from statistics white people hold the most narrow racial preferences than any other group.

Asians were the majority that dated outside their \textbf{race}, along with Hispanics and then blacks. Whites were the least of all. Tell me why is that???"Although 11 percent of white newlyweds are now married to someone of a different \textbf{race} or \textbf{ethnicity}, white people are still the least likely of all major racial or \textbf{ethnic} groups to intermarry. \textbf{Black} newlyweds, meanwhile, have seen the most dramatic increases of any group, from 5 percent in 1980 to 18 percent today."

First of, we all orginated from Africa and forcefully segregated ourselves to different places to adopt a few differences, even then we haven't been long enough to adopt significant changes to classify one group as a different species. Speciation hasn't taken place yet through genetic isolation for \textbf{race}/species to exist. The "exclusivity" you're championing for, is based on these superficial physical differences which should serve no logical reason for segregation.You folks then invaded and pillaged throughout the whole world exerting your influence, advertising how superior and attractive of a "\textbf{race}" you are and the whole world started believing your lies for quite some time. Recent studies have shown bias towards someone who looks like them is because of the overwhelming exposure they get from their surroundings, which here was a consequence of white exclusive segregated regions all these years."Following a series of studies, researchers have discovered that six- to nine-month-old infants demonstrated racial bias in favor of members of their own \textbf{race} and bias against those of other races.The findings are said to be a result of the overwhelming exposure infants have to their own \textbf{race}, and experts have warned it is wise to introduce children to people from a variety of races before the issues deepen."

This is hard evidence why we need more diversity/inclusivity to reverse the damage that was already caused through segregation all these years. Exposure effect in action.Forced segregation is NOT the same as forced diversity because while the former has likelihood to create more tensions and  negative stereotypes between groups, the latter closes the gap by familiarising people from each group. How absurd would it be if you keep believing "X food is the most delicious food for me" and hesitates to eat something else recommended to you, without even tasting it a few times? Sometimes, the taste of the food or a music you hear grows on you with time.You can argue that music/food doesn't have free will so it doesn't become an issue , but the issue is your decisions can indirectly impact others lives living in society. No matter how much you want to believe otherwise, we are all indirectly depended on each other in a society. Society functions best as collective. If you become too independent and selfish, it'll only create major imbalances in societal structure leading to its downfall. MGTOW, feminism, incels all are consequences of an imbalanced societal structure. The less we start caring about others issues, more and more problems further ensues. As a progressive society, it should cater to the concerns of everyone contributing equally to the society. That's how you maintain harmony and peace in a society.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nothing, Race & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}4/500 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.8 \\  \hline

The personalities are due to varying degrees of \textbf{mental} retardation. All dogs come from the same exact animal. They're just all genetically fucked up. Humans do not have breeds because we were not bred for certain characteristics. There are no human 'subspecies,' like seen in other animals. There are only humans. You are trying to argue against literally every credible scholar in this field. 'Generally, when it is used it is effectively a synonym of subspecies.[64] (For animals, the only taxonomic unit below the species level is usually the subspecies;[65] there are narrower infraspecific ranks in botany, and \textbf{race} does not correspond directly with any of them.)

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I have read a number of comments after watching this video.  I agree with some:  Is this really newsworthy?  I am a white male outside USA and my preference would be towards white females.  I do not understand why whites are discriminated against in general.If I buy one brand of car, based on a number of factors, I would not be discriminating against other brands like Ford over Chevy or Kia over Rolls Royce. I would be exercising a preference and well thought through decision. For buying a car things like price, quality, affordability and local support would be key for me to suit my needs and lifestyle.  And I do not expect to find a Chevy in a Ford dealership, let alone ranting at the Ford dealership for it!  That is just \textbf{crazy}.Likewise, I am sure other ethnicities and nationalities would offer women with characteristics which would meet most of my preferences as well. But it would add complexities too with religious and cultural differences. While I appreciate that some people manage to find solutions to these natural boundaries, and even prefer the adventure of doing so, I do not.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small SirRalph.. with that young ass picture of a now adult Naruto who is a family   man and Kage of his village, let's be clear on one thing. You're not an \textbf{African} American. You're a Nigerian American! Don't make the rest of the Nigerian world (Who are one of the most intelligent nations in the \textbf{African} continent) look unintelligent with your commentary. Now as far as your opinion goes, I agree. There's \textbf{nothing} racists about it in my opinion considering how many other different dating sites is geared towards specific ethnicities. I don't believe the term '\textbf{race} classification'. There's no such thing among the family of nation's flags. Those flags represent different nationalities including the \textbf{R\textbf{ed}} Flag with the Green 5 point star. The moors(muurs) flag that give them rights that protect them in this country. Which is what most awakened \textbf{African} Americans have adapted, after denouncing their ties to a color and a name that doesn't hold any value or protect them in this country. Only \textbf{race} is the hue'man \textbf{race}. Anything else referenced as \textbf{race} is a construct of the supreme courts. Just like the term Caucasian which they also adapted. No such thing as \textbf{black} and white, which is 2 of many colors in a crayon box. Look at your own pigment and the answer is clear as day. I digress, but people are entitled to have a preference. I like all types of women. I just feel from experience, pale/pink hue women are more sexually submissive and give outstanding T.W. btw..lose that young ass avatar Luzermaki. üòèüíØ You should at least have the Raikage, Darui or someone older.

There's almost 200 million people in Nigeria, over 371 (if I'm not mistaken) tribes and over 520 different dialects. They all retain their respective cultural traditions that identify them. Most \textbf{African} Americans are Natives to this land and have an identity. They just don't know which one they belong too! Some are mixed with their cousins the Africans and others are mixed with Europeans and the Africans. Some are pure native and you can see it in their features. The Washitaw(Washetaw) and Amirands were but 2 of them out of the 5,000,000+ that were here long before the colonialists settled here and brought the small portion of Africans to these very lands.

Neither makes anyone a \textbf{racist}, neither makes anyone a better or worse person. Who anyone dates is a matter of personal preference and needs no apology or explanation.

Even if i decided for whatever reason to specifically seek out other white people, i sure as hell wouldn't do it on "whitesmeet.com" as you just know that many people on there will have \textbf{racist} ideology, and that's a deal breaker for me. and for all the people saying "there are also dating sites for just \textbf{black} people" well i believe that stems from a different place. If there are dating sites for just \textbf{black} people it's probably because they are sick of dealing with \textbf{racism} and hatred and rejection, and find solace with others who understand, and will treat them as people. whereas white people dating is generally about keeping some "pure aryan \textbf{race}"  I think the motives are completely different.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Race, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}6/171 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.509 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I think it's normal for people to have biases; especially, when it comes to choices for romantic partners. \textbf{Nobody} can or should force people to date the people they don't fancy. However, you should question why you find some people attractive and others not, especially when the source of attraction isn't based on a person's characters but a person's \textbf{race}. If you look at what is considered beautiful for both male and female, the standard of beauty is people with Caucasian physical features. For proof, see people on TV, movies, magazines, billboards, etc., you'll see mostly white people, and life imitates arts. There is a long tradition in media to discriminate against people of color--I haven't seen an Asian man in a leading-roled superheroes yet, and I'm sill waiting. Although I'm very happy to see a \textbf{black} male lead for the latest Star Wars. As a result, people who consume mass media bought into the \textbf{racism} perpetuated by the media, believing the standard of beauty spoon fed by the media. It is not a simple case of \textbf{colored} drinking fountain or bathroom anymore. This is 2018; \textbf{racism} is a lot more subtle. It may seem like "preference", but it is in fact \textbf{racism} when you exclude a whole \textbf{race} from your consideration. That said, you will and should date who you want to date. However, I would challenge you to intentionally look for beauty in people of the races you may have judged as unattractive. You don't need to date or even talk to them. You just have to look for beauty in them. Chances are you will find some people of the \textbf{race} attractive--it is impossible to find all people of the \textbf{race} attractive, even for the \textbf{race} of your preference. You should make up your own preference and don't allow other people, especially the media, to influence you in such an important choice of your life like people you date or marry because I don't believe the media industry have your interests at heart. Besides, when you see more beauty in the world, you are the one who benefits from seeing all the beauty.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Colored, Nobody, Race, Racism & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}11/356 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.09 \\  \hline

(What they doing here?  Lawd, can't blacks have anything without white people sniffin up behind us)  yeah.  And some of them feel the same way about us.Why is that a problem?Do any of you know how annoying it is to be hit up by people outside your \textbf{race} over and over but you have no interest?From \textbf{age} 11 to present (almost 60) I have been a white male magnet.No matter where I go or the decade, white men wanted to date me and came at me like \textbf{crazy}. Even to this day,  If I make the mistake of smiling and talking to a white guy for over 5 minutes, I stand a good chance of either getting asked out or told how they wish they could ask me out.  Flattering at times now but also Afuckingnoying.For years, I never dated outside my \textbf{race} and did not want to.I was very pretty.  I got asked on dates at least 1 per day, often 3-5 times a day.Any time I stepped out of the house.That is NOT  fun or complimentary.  It vacillated between extremely annoying and scary.I never have used a dating site.  But if I did and despite my preferences, nonpreferences kept inboxing me, I would feel pissed AND harassed. Did it EVER occur to minorities that just like they need a break from white  interaction, rules and dominance,  some whites  need a break too.?If a white \textbf{woman} is seeking a white male, she should NOT have to put up with minority men cramming her box with invites.The fact she goes to a white site says it all: her PREFERENCE are white men.Same with white men.There is \textbf{NOTHING} that says whites no longer have the same rights as other races.They should not have to share space 24/7 or have to date, fuck or breed with blacks or anyone else.Can they have ANYTHING at all to themselves?Most ethnicities have their own customs, dating groups etc.  We force whites to blend, share, accept but we still keep our hoods, churches, \textbf{black} pride events, etc.Congrats white people.  This site is an excellent idea.  If you want to stop the feeding frenzy by minorities, go to this site.Enjoy each other..no more having to watch whatever you say or do because it is not PC this week.As for blacks, hispanics or Asians.  If ever the  white folks who date their own \textbf{race} EVER wants some Minority ass, they know where you are.Everybody needs a break.  \textbf{Nothing} wrong with a place to themselves.Also, this dating site should have a filter, if a nonwhite tries to hit up a white person, BLOCK IT.\textbf{Nobody} should have to field calls or emails from groups they are not interested in and no, whites do NOT have to want your \textbf{black} ass.It is not a \textbf{racist} thing, it is an aesthetic preference!!!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Black, Crazy, Nobody, Nothing, Race, Racist, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}14/591 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.369 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small As a white dude, I have to admit I find it difficult to navigate the dating scene in terms of racial preferences and such. Like, on one hand, I have dated men of multiple races, from white to \textbf{Indian} to \textbf{African} American and Latino. In that, racial issues where I don't necessarily understand their experiences as men of color in America have occasionally popped up. While I have never not dated someone because of their \textbf{race}, I have to be aware that they can't come to me, talk about their experiences that day in that sense and have me understand it the way a person of color would be able to understand it. Similarly, cultural differences between my suburban white experience and their experiences have led to miscommunications. I personally am willing to put in that work and understand those experiences and try to be there for that person, but you can't expect everyone to do that. Similarly, people of other races do have these "my \textbf{race} only" dating sites and thats permitted, often because they want to date someone who has similar cultural experiences to them. I don't think its a problem for white people to do the same thing. While I personally wouldn't care enough that my SO is of a certain \textbf{race} to make a profile on any website dedicated to that \textbf{race} exclusively, I think that other people having those perferences is perfectly fine.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African, Indian, Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Ethnicity - Native-American & \cellcolor{green!5}6/238 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.521 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Yeah, sounds perfectly fine to me! It sounds like you're trying to tell people that they MUST have these wide open preferences, but that's contrary to very definition of the word 'preferences'. A preference is a discrimination (another word that's been boogeymanned) of things you do not enjoy, find safe, or want to partake in. For example, I do not like hard drugs, thus I discriminate against drugs and my preference is someone who is not a drug user. Otherwise the relationship would be off to a very rocky start. So yes, there is \textbf{nothing} wrong with having discriminatory tastes against things you do not enjoy or find contrary to your own lifestyle and principles. And to address racial preference directly, I will say that human beings are very tribal in nature. Even in Europe, a place that many people do not affiliate with tribal structures, was VERY tribal not a few hundred years ago. To me, it makes far more sense to want to seek out someone who looks more like you, talks and sounds more like you, has the same tastes in cultural things as you, shared the same interests as you such as cultural similarities. For example, I would find it difficult to share Christian ideals if I had a Muslim wife. Granted that's a religious difference, the same can be said for other cultural differences. I find your argument to be hypocritical in which you say people absolutely must seek out people of other races to find compatibility, yet the most fundamental traits of compatibility are cultural traits, and even racial traits in some regards. This is why we have Latino neighborhoods, \textbf{black} neighborhoods, Asian neighborhoods, etc. let alone markets that are geared towards certain races and cultures, and other institutions that are for or attract members of certain races and cultures. It seems that the vast majority of people who support these ideas that we should mix or that we must are mostly white people, and that most other people (except some in the \textbf{black} community perhaps) don't even remotely feel this way.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!27}3/348 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.862 \\  \hline

That applies to any site they visit. Yes we all discriminate on others, regardless of our individual genders, \textbf{race}, profession, height, weight etc. I'm just saying that it shouldn't be an issue if someone starts a site or business targeting a group of people without shutting out all others. For example some companies like pharmaceutical ones will manufacture drugs designed to treat Caucasian, \textbf{African} skin and even hair care since we bleed the same but our skins and hair are completely different. Even kids require different medication and dosage than adults thus the different care systems. Point is that we are not all the same and shouldn't raise eye brows simply because others want different stuff or people to cater to their wants or needs. Everyone has a favorite color when it comes to a car, living room wall, phone cover and such. It does not mean they hate all the other colors and it's only a preference based on their own personal reasons.Yes I know, this is \textbf{weird} comparing babies and all but hey!

Some gays will say it's a choice some will say it's not so that's a different scenario. But there is a very big difference between \textbf{racism} and preference. Preference being I like them all, but I prefer this to that given the option. Excluding a people whether it be your own is a form of discrimination or \textbf{racism}. Just bc you don't feel \textbf{racist} doesn't make it so. People can't help the way they look or skin tone which is what we're typically basing this argument over. So for someone to say I like girl A and B but I prefer girl A is a preference. Which is the exact definition of the word.

That's the difference. Again that goes for any \textbf{race}. I'm \textbf{black}. I don't have a specific preference for \textbf{race}.

You're making a mountain out of a mole hill. You seem to be confused by your own opinion on this subject but are acting like I'm the one misunderstanding something. Last time I checked, \textbf{racism} was just hating other races out of spite. A horrible ideology that lead to a lot of pain and suffering. Not rejecting some minor dating advances. I'm still going to prefer dating my own kind, and coincidentally, actually doing it.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Kinney Kolah It's late at night and I don't feel like scanning over all of that and writing so I'll just reply to each one of your points like this. "what are you talking about. \textbf{Racism} is simply \textbf{race} deep. No one called you a \textbf{racist}."You say this but you blunty call me one just a few sentences down. If you wrote that correctly, you very much imply that I am.

That is a preference. I also defined \textbf{racism}. You asked if it only applies to white people. I said 'no'. So clearly your the one not getting it."Uh... That wasn't a very significant question I asked you and doesn't have much to do with whether or not I'm "getting it". A little irrelevant. Was more along the lines of poking fun. "\textbf{Racism} is thinking your better than other races or hating/disliking them simply bc of \textbf{race}. Clearly your not seeing the difference." I never said otherwise. That was my point in fact. lol"I'll give you an example. 1. A white man. He says I like \textbf{black} girls and white girls but I prefer white girls. Preference. 2. A white man. I like white girls, but I refuse to date \textbf{black} girls bc they are loud, obnoxious, dark, and I don't find anything about them attractive. All of them included. (That goes for any other \textbf{race}) That is \textbf{racism}." Duh? Also those are also two very different opinions. I don't fall into either category. I've seen attractive \textbf{black} women, but I'm not attracted to them like I am my own kind. I've said this three times now. If you don't understand what I mean by that, which I guess you don't, I'm talking about being attracted out of identity. The fact that we share \textbf{ethnicity} is an attractive factor to me -- and why I prefer to be with them. No one understands this much anymore because most of you have a shattered \textbf{ethnic} background. I know where I belong though.  "If you still don't get it then don't let me be the one to educate you." Sorry but you haven't educated me on anything. I would have let you if you made a good argument. I've spoken to plenty of people like you and it's always much of the same."Stay in your thought process or learn from someone else. You don't see a issue excluding a \textbf{race} from your life simply bc of their culture or skin tone \textbf{racist}? That says more about you than me. But again. I'm not God, I'm just stating my opinion, whether you agree or disagree" Ahhh the holier than thou complex. Immature. Don't act like you're better than me because you don't me. That being said, for the same reason you never showed me how I'm harming anyone by "excluding" them like this, you won't tell me WHAT I could be missing out on by dating outside my tribe.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Attakullakulla Oukonunaka 1.your still not getting it. I said rejecting a \textbf{race} simply bc of \textbf{race} is \textbf{racist}. If you feel that's a shot at you then that's you. I'm sorry.2. I'm not acting like I'm holier or smarter than you. My point on the matter was I'm not better than you so I'm not the one you should be getting an opinion on if you truly disagree w me3. That's the point I'm making. Your not expressing hate on someone or refusing to date a certain \textbf{race} based on hateful reasons, ie your not \textbf{racist}.4. \textbf{Racism} summed up is a hate for ones culture, skin, \textbf{race}, \textbf{ethnicity}, if you please. A preference is having no malicious hate for a \textbf{race}, at the end of the day you like what you like.5. I'm simply stating my opinion shouldn't offend bc I'm not offended by yours. You did educate me. I now have a wider perspective on how some people think. Doesn't mean your opinion is wrong or that I'm ignoring it, I'm just not gonna change mine.6. I'm not gonna degrade your intelligence bc I don't know you or how you think. If you feel I have then I apologize. At the end of the this debate doesn't apply to someone who knows the difference.7. Overall my message was targeted to those who do not know the difference between the two. And I've meant enough people who will date a \textbf{black} man, treat the half \textbf{black} babies like shit, bc those babies are half \textbf{black} females, or train those kids to not date \textbf{black} people bc being mixed or non \textbf{black} is better than being full \textbf{black}. 8. If you actually read my response you would have gotten all that bc that was what I basically said in a lot of words. 9. Your not harming anyone that I know of but you'd be surprised how many people where I come from have so much self hate bc their not light or mixed enough, who feel the need to lie about their \textbf{race}, to bleach their skin and get surgery to look anything but \textbf{black} bc of hidden \textbf{racism} being called preference.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Kinney Kolah Fair enough I understand where you're coming from.But to cut it short, the point I was trying to make there, where you say I'm not gettng it, is that you're saying I'm not \textbf{racist} but say rejecting someone bc of their \textbf{race} is \textbf{racist}.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Attakullakulla Oukonunaka let me ask you this, why do you honestly care? You said rejecting someone based on \textbf{race} is a minor thing, if I'm correct, my question is, why do you care then? Why does \textbf{race} matter as long as you are connecting with a person you generally care for? Why is it such a big deal to date a native \textbf{woman} as opposed to any other \textbf{race} if \textbf{race} is minor?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I said rejecting someone because of their \textbf{race} is minor in the sense that it isn't harmful. I don't do it because I don't believe in it. I don't believe in it, because I believe in preserving bloodline, and therefore my \textbf{race}. If every other native man and \textbf{woman} intermingled outside of their respected tribe, those tribes would go extinct and eventually our entire population would be blended into the dominating populations. And gone only as a genetic trace -- just like past hominid species. Historically, this has been the case for much of aboriginal downfall since colonialism, and in other places too like Australia. Disease, famine, war, massacres. If those are factors, so was our races mixing sexually. Albeit softer. Regardless of what brings our numbers down, it's still a problem and needs a solution.Our populations are already so unbelievably low it's not even funny. And I have every right to want to want to strengthen our \textbf{ethnicity} by staying true to it. So \textbf{race} does matter to me, it's something bigger than me, and when you date someone you take more into consideration than just your feelings. Who my children will be is one thing I take into consideration. I'm not perfect, they won't be perfect, our \textbf{race} will never be perfect. \textbf{Nothing} is perfect but it can be a lot better than it is and needs to be the best it can be. In fact, I think imperfection is perfection in moderation. It's not puritanism, it's caring about your people in the best way and the right way.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity, Nothing, Race, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}7/262 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.672 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Attakullakulla Oukonunaka and I wish more races thought that way. But sadly, not everyone has the same intentions as you, long story short, rejecting someone based off their \textbf{race} can and in some cases cause psychological problems when it comes to self hate. They don't want kids who look like them, or have their genes or features. They want to breed the 'ugly' out of themselves. Ex. Google Lil Kim. Is just one of millions. But people are filled with so much hate for no other reason than believing they are superior to others. They can be so spiteful and ppl with self hate will still flock to them bc their basically brainwashed to think they are worthless. I used to be think that way when I was 7-18yrs \textbf{old}. I'm in my early 20s now and I don't think that way anymore. Imagine walking into a room full of Native American women and having to wonder if they are 'into' Native American men or even like them. That kind of stuff has a massive effect especially on children. But interracial dating is not a problem for me personally as long as you have the right mindset. But I do wish my \textbf{race} would unite like they did before segregation ended.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I find it strange to have a strong preference for one \textbf{race} - like you would ONLY date people within that \textbf{race}.

While I love exploring other cultures, I want to feel like I can be comfortable and myself in a relationship. My boyfriend is European, I'm American and even that difference can be hard for us sometimes, but we're still comfortable and open with each other more so than we've ever been with anyone else.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small It absolutely fits the definition. You're pre-judging a potential future child of yours as inferior to you based on the colour of their skin. If its simply that someone's not attracted to white/black/latino/etc. people then fair enough, but if its literally a conscious decision of "I will not have a baby that isn't purely my own \textbf{race}" then yeah that does qualify as \textbf{racist}. Like for me personally I've hooked up with people of various races, if I was to now decide I want children but because I'm wanting a child I now only want a white lady that is a \textbf{racist} decision. I'm pre-judging someone based on their \textbf{race}.Its the kind of \textbf{racism} that's just in your heart. If you can square it with yourself morally then its fine, you're not hurting anyone and if you treat your kid(s) right then you're doing good in life. But it is prejudice.Just anytime \textbf{race} is the deciding factor by which you make a decision and you're choosing something based on colour of skin its \textbf{racism}. If you're not dealing with the individual, only the \textbf{race}, its the dictionary definition of \textbf{racism}/prejudice.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Race, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}8/192 & \cellcolor{green!5}4.167 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Sam maybe fits the definition of "\textbf{racist}" but I don't see it as immoral in any way. I think it's a natural biological urge to want your children to resemble you, and a lot people care about what their kids will look like, as petty as that might sound. I've hooked up with women of many races, and I personally don't give a shit if I have mixed kids, but I also wouldn't make a judgement on someone's morality if they told that they wouldn't want mixed kids. Sure, its making a judgement based on race/looks, but when I think of "\textbf{racism}", I think of something that is immoral, which I don't think that is.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/115 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.739 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I think that describing it as preservation of your \textbf{race} makes it more obviously cross the line. Just because then we're beginning to cross over to the superiority/purity of races thing. But ultimately decisions about children and love are entirely personal. If a friend told me they wanted a baby of their own \textbf{race} because they wanted to support the preservation of their \textbf{race} I think I'd struggle to accept that. It'd be their decision entirely but I don't think I could be friends with someone who was that motivated by skin colour.Like I understand that there's people out there who think that way, and that they may go through life never being \textbf{racist} to anyone, but at the end of the day when it comes to choosing who is gonna be around you if \textbf{race} is a dealbreaker then that's not entirely innocent.Its an awkward one. I can see it both ways, I just swing more towards the side of any sort of negative judgement made purely on skin colour is \textbf{racism}. Not the kinda \textbf{racism} you need to fight, just the kind that should be acknowledged. But all of this is just my opinion, and what the fuck do I know as a white guy in his mid 20s with no kids and no plans to have any....Good talk, its nice being able to talk about difficult stuff without it devolving into bullshit.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Sam, well handled on this debate.  The only thing on your argument I wonder about is the idea of people wanting kids that resemble them.  From what I've seen, more often than not mixed children are just as much of a balance between the parents as mono-racial children and carry split resemblance between both ethnicities.

Ultimately I stick to my original point that if \textbf{race} is a deal-breaker when it comes to choosing a partner for procreation, then you are a \textbf{racist}.

They should be able to discriminate in who they hire too, but that's illegal for now.

All this effort to force \textbf{race} mixing is ultimately what makes people more \textbf{racist} and is leading to more hard-line segregationist and ethnonationalist movements. The classical liberal attitude of live and let live has been abandoned, and now different groups feel they need to dominate or purge one another just so they can be left alone.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Hi, I'm a white \textbf{woman}. I don't personally have racial preferences, but I get how some people do. Especially guys, they are visual so they find a certain 'look' more appealing. The difference is being open to getting to know someone who is otherwise a match even if they're not that persons primary preference. Like if you prefer brown hair, you shouldn't turn a person down simply because they're hair is blond. Or on eye color preferences. No one factor should be the one physical attribute that you refuse to date, \textbf{race} in particular. If so, it just means you are shallow and value the wrong things in people.  I knew a white guy who turned down a girl who liked him with the only reason being 'I don't date \textbf{black} girls.' I thought this was a stupid reason because he basically just cut off an entire races eligibility. He could have said they didn't have chemistry or he didn't like her that way. But his reason was solely based on her \textbf{race} alone. He wasn't a catch anyway so she dodged a bullet there. It's kind of like how I have a body size preference but I'm open to guys who don't fit that preference as well. If they're a good fit in other ways (emotional, chemistry) I'll still try. In fact my current boyfriend is a big guy, but I am glad I was open to him, 2 years later. I don't have an issue with the site existing. Not my problem, in the end. But it is kind of \textbf{dumb}, on the other hand, that a lot of white people (as the majority) subconsiously ignore any other \textbf{race} profiles on sites, either because of a preference or just because they don't stand out as candidates. Maybe they dont know any other \textbf{race} of person in their life so they don't think as them as contenders. It sucks for the minority \textbf{race} people just trying to find love being ignored by a majority of other daters on the sites. And with this being the case white people Really dont need Another site that caters to them specifically. They'll find way more white people on the more popular and uncontroversial sites anyway.

What is stopping a white person from going on match and eharmony(mind you-you can still set racial preferences by the way on there)? The problem is two fold, it is a GENETIC psychological problem passed down in white blood mixed with and/or decades of racial and identity politics in the USA that causes this. I still can't get over the fact that they live in FUCKING SALT LAKE UTAH(that is whiter than leprosy).Where white people meet is dog whistle politics for where \textbf{racist} white people can meet(in secret to do and say bad things hence their issues with flag activity), because only a \textbf{racist} white person would think that they needed a site called where white people meet to meet other white people. As for the where \textbf{black} people meet thing. \textbf{Racist} either don't understand maths or are \textbf{racist}.When you factor in the fact that blacks are a MINORITY, and also the fact that a relative chunk of their population will not yet be online(dating)couple that with other \textbf{racist} issues like mass incarceration.You have a small population spread over a large surface population area, it would then be GENUIINLY DIFFICULT for blacks to meet a POSSIBLE \textbf{black} candidate, because i bet you that all those blacks on where \textbf{black} people meet are also n sites like Eharmony and Match they just have to compensate with sites like WBPM....blacks are not \textbf{racist}. Blacks don't have a history of murdering, slaving and dehumanizing other people WILLINGLY!!!. Whites have that history and still do it today. Another stupid argument similar to that was passed by that retarded bastard Jared Taylor -whites don't have a home for themselves.There where no whites in the Entre USA, New Zealand, Hawaii, S.Africa and Australia just to name a fee those places are still inhabited by white people due to THEFT and MURDER.If there were no whites in any of the aforementioned countries and \textbf{colored} people where flooding into Europe then we could have a discussion.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Colored, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}11/408 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.696 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small UNCD Inc I think it's a foolish argument to say that blacks have a harder time meeting other blacks due to the size of the \textbf{black} community. Sites like this are developed because of preference. As a white man, I don't want to have to check filters in order to select a specific \textbf{race}. I date white and I want white, so there's no reason why I can't go to a dating site that provides a large selection of the white women I'm looking for. I also don't want to be emailed by non whites since I'm looking for whites. I want to be comfortable in my own demographic. There's absolutely \textbf{nothing} wrong with this. Saying that blacks have a harder time meeting other blacks is completely ridiculous. Blacks have their own dating sites and utilize every other dating website available. It is more factual to say that blacks have an easier time meeting other blacks. Every non white \textbf{race} has their own dating site while whites have to choose from multicultural dating sites (multicultural = less whites) To argue against a 100 white  populated dating site is just more anti white bigotry.

There are sites designed for people who would like to meet an Asian, Latin or \textbf{Black} partner, irrespective of their \textbf{race}.

There's \textbf{nothing} wrong with a white person wanting to date and/or marry a white person; doesn't that statement fit most white people in the world? Of course it does. It becomes a problem when someone makes a website and says, only \textbf{black} people or white people or Asian people can go on it. This isn't a discussion about preference, it's a discussion about the premise of the site. That said, if someone has a dating preference that excludes "other" racial groups, then he or she is most certainly a \textbf{racist}.

The problem is two fold, it is a GENETIC psychological problem passed down in white blood mixed with and/or decades of racial and identity politics in the USA that causes this. I still can't get over the fact that they live in FUCKING SALT LAKE UTAH(that is whiter than leprosy).Where white people meet is dog whistle politics for where \textbf{racist} white people can meet(in secret to do and say bad things hence their issues with flag activity), because only a \textbf{racist} white person would think that they needed a site called where white people meet to meet other white people. As for the where \textbf{black} people meet thing. \textbf{Racist} either don't understand maths or are \textbf{racist}.When you factor in the fact that blacks are a MINORITY, and also the fact that a relative chunk of their population will not yet be online(dating)couple that with other \textbf{racist} issues like mass incarceration.You have a small population spread over a large surface population area, it would then be GENUIINLY DIFFICULT for blacks to meet a POSSIBLE \textbf{black} candidate, because i bet you that all those blacks on where \textbf{black} people meet are also n sites like Eharmony and Match they just have to compensate with sites like WBPM....blacks are not \textbf{racist}. Blacks don't have a history of murdering, slaving and dehumanizing other people WILLINGLY!!!. Whites have that history and still do it today. Another stupid argument similar to that was passed by that retarded bastard Jared Taylor -whites don't have a home for themselves.There where no whites in the Entre USA, New Zealand, Hawaii, S.Africa and Australia just to name a fee those places are still inhabited by white people due to THEFT and MURDER.If there were no whites in any of the aforementioned countries and \textbf{colored} people where flooding into Europe then we could have a discussion.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Colored, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}11/408 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.696 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Well I'll say this. Most of the worlds problems have been and are still caused by white people-wars/racism/pollution/genocide. It is true that Europeans have contributed a large amount to the development of the "modern" world-but at what cost? and the term "Modern" is relative. Egypt would have considered it self the modern world in that time. The term "White" is a cult term. What i am saying is that every "white" person is born into a CULT-as long as they are born in and grow up in a western country, All right wing parties have CULT like affinities (Totalitarianism/Lack of personal identity(Ergo "I am white/i am a collective"/Us vs them mentality/Different set of moral laws relating to those "others"(Every white colonial country has had Discrimination directly written into their law books(from New Zealand to S.Africa to USA to Australia but not necessarily European countries(Europeans are not white-they are dutch, Italian etc)/Stigmatization of anyone who breaks the CULT mindset or thinks for themselves(White women who date \textbf{black} men are virulently castigated and are labelled mud sharks other examples include Libtards/Snowflake etc)/Cults feed their members a steady dose of misinformation propaganda and as a cult member it is mandatory that you believe what the leaders/group tell you WITHOUT CHECKING IT OR THINKING CRITICALLY Its why you have white people who think that minorities especially \textbf{black} people get extra points on SATs just for indicating \textbf{race},you have white people that said they preferred the Affordable care act to Obamacare and actually gave lengthy arguments about the two, even-though they are the same thing( They didn't bother to check because other cult members/white people told me therefore it must be true. Also cults make sure to ISOLATE its members from the outside world/others SEGREGATION LAWS IN THE USA/JIM \textbf{CROW} LAWS.What the isolation does is that it enables the propaganda/lies to take deep root.That's why you have 80 of the white population in the 1960s and 50s say that "\textbf{Black} people face absolutely no barriers or hindrance to employment/schooling and/or housing due to their \textbf{race} in the USA"--This was in the 60s! when riots where happening, dogs where being set on people, water hoses and all that stuff. Communism is a white affair, the entire soviet union was more or less "white" that made it possible to kill more than 40million people plus an extra 7million in ukraine(holodomore)-White people have killed more people than any other group of people on this planet combined -including killing the most amount of white people-Europes entire history is soaked in bloody wars. I am not saying that all white people are bad, there are good white people example G.H Hardy,but the truth of the matter is that most white people are BAD PEOPLE.I think it is a genetic thing-another topic for another day-but i,ll leave you with this lovely video- [LINK]   [LINK]  are part of a cult.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Crow, Race & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}6/478 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.255 \\  \hline
