  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Having completed a doctorate in stem cell and cancer genetics where 17 out of 21 PhD students were women, I can say there is a definite disparity between male and female brains. There were more scholarships available to women only and my secondary supervisor actually admitted to me that she only recruits female applicants. Interestingly, the 4 male students, myself included worked longer hours in the lab, had less support yet produced all the first-author publications. We spoke about science in our spare time because we were extremely passionate about our subjects and technology in general. The women hardly ever spoke about science, most of the chat in the female dominated PhD office was about clothes,  lunch and who each \textbf{woman} was currently dating.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/124 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.806 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Some people hold the opinion that Political Correctness has gone way beyond the point of being fit for purpose. When I was growing up in the 60s and 70s, there were \textbf{racist} jokes and even \textbf{racist} sitcoms, women were treated in a very demeaning way by some men in the workplace and other arena, it was ok to make fun of people for being in any way different, etc. This was clearly not good. My generation totally bought into the fact that all people deserve the same courtesy, opportunity and rights. It seems very much now that the people that were bullied in the past are now being the bullies.  Neither of the above situations are acceptable.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small It is interesting although that this \textbf{woman} has a channel, the most viewed video linked on her channel is probably she being destroyed by Milo. There are a lot of women who are strong enough, and motivated enough that they don't need men to make room for them. Strong people don't ask others to make special accommodations for them, they show what they can do with action.  Katie Hopkins is the model there, and interestingly this \textbf{woman} also debated Katie Hopkins and she was instantly destroyed.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/86 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.326 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small 2:18 "I don't think that's the issue, I think it's about confidence" this is the problem, someone makes a valid point based on studies and research and a feminist immediately disregards it and counterpoints with something based on opinions, feelings or emotions. There is no point in debating a feminist because no \textbf{woman} (and a lot of men) is ever going to turn their back on their own self beliefs within a small time frame, especially when they are there to argue for one side of the debate... even if the facts, figures, logic and science are slapping them right in the face.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/103 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.971 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small What a load of garbage. Women outnumber men in university and in many scientific degrees like psychology and biology. They are underrepresented in more technical sciences like engineering and physics and maths due to brain differences making skill sets difference between the sexes. Evolution selected Male and females differently. Male brains TEND to be more systematic and female brains more empathic. Of course NOT ALL, but most. Conqueror  nurturer divide. To imagine this will NOT lead to different desires and abilities would lack basic \textbf{common} sense. IQ also is a huge factor as the average maybe the same between the groups but males tend to be disproportionately represented at the lower and upper ends. This is partly why men are more likely to be professors of even the subjects dominated by women.

It's the plain truth.We don't complain when women dominate subjects like nursing, netball, being midwives, teaching, badminton, childcare courses, dance classes then we shouldn't complain when men dominate subjects like football, science, playing chess, playing fifa, rugby, constrcution, basketball and so on.That's just how life is.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Dumb, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}2/91 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.198 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small At 8:47 the journalist/'referee' made a conclusive, rounding up remark which completely misrepresented  Sir Hunt's controversial comments. She wrongly stated that he had said that women should 'STAY OUT OF THE SCIENCE LAB' because they cry and fall in love, whereas what Hunt had actually said was that men and women should not work together in the lab because they were a romantic distraction - falling in love with EACH OTHER and that women would cry if criticised by men.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Cory Mck I read that study the article mentions.Seems the negative bias against resumes with female names was the same regardless of the professor's \textbf{gender}, \textbf{age}, discipline, or tenure status. In fact, it highlighted an important point: the people that were more likely to rate females lower for competency, hireability, mentoring, and salary were the people who interacted with students on a regular basis.Could it be that the reason they were rated lower was because those who interacted with students more were able to tell that qualifications of paper weren't the same as experiences they've personally had with people. Even though everyone rated likeability for females higher across the board, they don't seem to think they're as competent even with the same qualifications.It may be that male and female professors have had better experiences with male students throughout their academic careers, something which would not be found by looking at identical resumes. Might it be that since they interact with students they've seen disparities between male and female grades and how intelligent, motivated, etc. they are in person from having conversations with them. Might it be that this bias isn't necessarily rooted in \textbf{sexism} and instead due to them noticing biological differences, where males are more willing to work longer hours, take more risks, be more aggressive, etc. That would mean that equally qualified males and females on paper are in fact not equally qualified in reality.A personal anecdote I have for this is recently I did a job that required a lot of running around delivering and moving stuff and then being on standby when things needed to get done. I ended up running around, moving items, and delivering things noticeably more than the females. In fact a female brought this up in a gathering saying that I did far more work than her or any others that day. We both had the same job description and requirements and we could put the same thing on a resume yet those that experienced the workers that day would notice a disparity of labour where men did more work. We were being paid the same, too, so there wasn't any monetary incentive to do more work. I've noticed this same disparity in many of the jobs I've had where men just outwork women on average. I would figure those professors that worked with students would notice this same disparity and this would be reflected in how they rate males and females.On top of all of this and to end it, I've read other studies and seen videos referencing these studies that show females are more likely to be hired as a percentage of their \textbf{gender} that submitted resumes than males. If there were 20 females and 80 males going after the job, a higher percentage of those females would be hired with respect to the males.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Gender, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}4/480 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.833 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small +Stella blue First off, we are a sexually diamorphic species - I have no idea how anyone could actually disagree with this on a logical or social level.  Men and women are not that different on an intelligence level for sure ( I think a study had men  couple of IQ points above women on average - but pretty negligible). Studies do show that most women tend to huddle around IQ averages than men, whereas men vary greatly on the IQ scale, which is why the geniuses of our society are mostly men but also most dumbasses are men as well.But men and women do have different strengths and weaknesses as genders, and the compliment each other quite well.  Men tend to gravitate towards jobs with more money and more dangerous work, while women tend to gravitate towards jobs that is more fulfilling to them personally.  Men and Women have different outlooks on life - there is \textbf{nothing} wrong with this at all.  That is what Milo is saying, he is not calling women stupid, far from it.  He is pointing out women make different life choices to men.  I am sure they are choices that feminists hate, but they are CHOICES - isn't that what feminism is all about - for women to make their own choices.

Yep, feminism is totally legit in its argument and activism //rolls eyes//And regarding this video, Dr. Grossman herself supports Tim Hunt's statement, even though she doesn't realise it and she actually thinks she's arguing against him. She says that women in general are "more sensitive" and more prone to crying. She even admitted she cried after her exams in Cambridge, in which she scored higher than most of her male colleagues. She also stressed how the STEM "environment" must be changed to better suit female "sensitivity".

So it's not even an argument from authority; it's what I'd call The Argument from FALSE Authority.With that out of the way, let's see what Milo and Dr. Grossman are saying. Dr. Grossman states that women are disadvantaged in pursuing STEM fields. Milo countered by saying that in college, women are outperforming men on average. Not only that, there are more women enrolling in colleges and universities than men. Here's a short link on that: [LINK] This is an unprecedented trend in history. You'd think that with so many women enrolling in college, their collective strength would force the so-called "sexist" STEM fields to open up to the new and vast market of potential female workforce.

Which also means that women AREN'T worthy or capable to follow science carrers, specially the ones men dominate (its not a coincidence), and if they're not being handed everything, they can't stand for a qualification and competence's competition (which is how the freakin working market works) BECAUSE THEY DON'T FEEL SAFE OR PREPARED.Equality?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small They both raise valid points but I don't think either of them have really reached a final rational conclusion. At certain levels women are disadvantaged and at certain levels men are disadvantaged. Girls don't want to go into STEM as often as men and their own limiting beliefs do negatively affect their performance as Dr. Grossman notes. It may be beneficial to identify where they are hearing these messages and educate them so that they do not accept them personally. Still, nowadays they get into college more easily, do better at school, get jobs more easily and are paid better up until they are in their 30s like Milo says.If they can get past their own doubts they will do better and that actually suggests they may currently have a bigger real advantage and their biggest disadvantage is in fact their own beliefs.Would accommodating women's different style perhaps by reducing competitiveness benefit women and reduce their doubts? Perhaps, but that also means that it may negatively affect men and this actually would be a rational reason to segregate them professionally to some degree. Would this be economically, socially, and politically advantageous on balance? It's impossible to say.Are men simply more naturally adept due to their biology in certain areas? Perhaps, but the science is still out. Are women more naturally inclined to pursue other interests? Perhaps, but the science is still out. It is not enough to point out that in certain cultures where women have more freedom, financial equity, or however Milo is defining "more equality," they choose not to enter STEM. There may be plenty of biases in these cultures that still subtly suggest that STEM is not as feminine or there may be other legitimate social costs for a \textbf{woman} entering STEM. But given women's evolutionary role there is certainly some credibility to the idea that women's brains are different and that they may be naturally drawn towards careers whose tasks reflect those roles such as those that engage in more caregiving and empathizing. This cannot be discounted on some philosophical notion that men and women are equal simply because they can still be equal in value but have different tendencies and aptitudes.Are there stereotypes that discourage women from pursuing STEM degrees? At least in the US I think so, but what are they proposing is done about it? Milo makes a good point in that it should be an individual decision to make when determining what they really want to pursue and the onus is on them to make an assessment of their own capabilities just like every man must. Even if men truly were more capable in STEM professions, there is enough variability that that alone should not rule out all women. But some still will rule themselves out. Again, where are these messages coming from and how can we curb them? I would suggest identify the sources and educate.Are women more likely to cry? As it is, sure, but let them cry and deal with it appropriately. Don't give them special treatment whenever they cry.  Let them experience and express their emotions healthily. Maybe men need to learn ways to better handle other people experiencing their emotions without needing to get them to stop or being so uncomfortable that it affects their ability to work and treat them as they would any other co-worker. This probably will also greatly help men who have a tendency to cry and probably experience even more negative emotions surrounding it like shame since it's unmanly. Maybe women (and men who cry so to speak) need better ways to manage their own emotions, to learn to tolerate criticism without becoming overwhelmed by their emotions, and to not expect special treatment when they do cry (and by this I am not excluding a mature, empathetic response), and learn how to move forward when it does happen. So, I think it's important to identify these things, educate and train rather than broadly painting one \textbf{gender} as the victim and the other as the oppressor, or by giving special privileges to one over the other. The goal should be integration of traditional as well as continually changing \textbf{gender} differences in an evolving world.But on top of all this I think what was said and what is being debated are two wildly different things. I don't think there is anything necessarily irresponsible with Sir Tim Hunt stating his own beliefs in the way that he put them and it only hurts the case being put forward to get distracted by it and reject it outright because it doesn't sound like the ideal envisioned by activists trying to get women more involved in STEM. Certainly, the dialogue has been opened up by his off-the-cuff remarks. And in any case, it's not necessarily an ineffective idea to segregate. It hasn't been shown one way or another that it is. Then again, I think it's reasonable to believe that there are other less drastic measures we can attempt to solve any problems that arise due to \textbf{gender} differences in the work place before resorting to segregation of any kind given it's sordid history.Besides, I don't think what he says reflects the belief that women are less capable in STEM. He isn't saying that no women should enter STEM at all. But until people are educated and trained, until they have the skills to handle these differences there is likely some truth to his assertions that work place romances and a perceived inability to handle criticism affects overall productivity.

There are other areas where we could transfer women into STEM like for example, there are a lot of women in business, social sciences and teaching that I think should go into STEM. There are already an too much teachers whether male or female and reducing these extra teachers could be helpful in promoting those females to go into STEM. So no, I don't think it's going to affect a lot.People's interests change. It's not absolute at all and is very fluid. And also at the end of day the interests of individuals have to be aligned in some way to the interests towards the economy and cultural development. \textbf{Gender} segregation in job sectors is bad for the economy and culturally we have to evolve to be motivated towards tasks that we might otherwise have found uninterested before.

Notice the anchor's referee type approach to Dr. Emily, as opposed to the man. Just count the number of times she cut off Dr. Emily vs. the man. Why is this the case? a) Jealousyb) For the same reason that kidnapping victims often come to defend their captor. Humans have a desire for familiarity. Some women thus may find it difficult to "go against the grain" and speak up against a man, in support of her fellow \textbf{woman}.2. The man repeatedly tries to put Dr. Emily into an "inept, vengeful female" box. He can't fathom that a female is able to have emotions, meanwhile put them aside in order to rise to the top. This is quite ignorant, though. Often behind a successful women is a girl who once learned the consequences of romance and distractions.

This is especially evident in Prison where men construct themselves based on followers and leaders (gangs) while women re-create a familial structure with sisterhood bonds.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Beta male, Blind & \cellcolor{green!5}Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality & \cellcolor{green!5}2/116 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.724 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@MyKeyMoonShine The \textbf{woman} in the video actually speaks the truth while Milo gave a very quasy unsophisticated analysis of what is going on. Stereotype effect is very powerful and deters women going into male dominated fields. Even women who are very good at math feel they would not be good enough in competition with the other men. Not to mention the reputation of STEM Fields being sexist and lack any female socialization. This is definitely one of the two key factors why women go less into STEM fields and contributes women to have poor confidence about it.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/97 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.031 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@DarkTriad A citation would be useful. At this point we have conflicting accounts anyway so I don't see how we can know anyway. Even if it wasn't a joke him being forced to resign over expressing his opinion is ridiculous and I have \textbf{nothing} but contempt for anyone who would support this. Are we seriously putting the sensibilities of a few uptight feminists above medical science? Seriously? How does this do anything but harm?\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!27}1/74 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.351 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@DarkTriad Sorry for the very late reply, i've been busy. Thanks for sourcing but it's basially those two women's word against a lot of other people's word and evidence that contradicts their claims. Here's a good write up explaining why [LINK] The fact that they were both obviously intent on creating a \textbf{witch} hunt over this doesn't make me inclined to trust them either.Anyway, as I said, this is silly.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Nick Barden Yes, those countries are behind in LEGAL equality and some social equality but when it comes to education they have more equal roles than the west. Sweden still has culture stereotypes and beliefs about certain sectors even if there are no "\textbf{gender} roles".My point wasn't about social \textbf{gender} roles but the construct of STEM environments as non-social ones versus STEM in Asia where it has always been traditionally more social and open.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/75 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.667 \\  \hline
