\hline\cellcolor{green!27}\small I have a question for you and please respond to it if you can. Why is it bad to be a man? I mean it's not like men are out in the world trying to be bad or do bad things. Being a 15 year \textbf{old} boy I can't help but wonder why should I be punished for being a certain \textbf{gender}. Both men and women need each other to survive. Lastly it should be celebrated that your a man or a women because at the end of the day it sure beats being dead or non-existent.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender, Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/97 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.062 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I have had to hold down emotions so long that I can barely cry on command. My grandpa who I was very close to died and I cried for real. An incredibly close family friend died and I kind of had to fake the crying. Then my father died when I was NINE. But I had already held in so many emotions that I had to cry on command. I didn't shed a tear at my baby cousins funeral because I couldn't even cry on command. The amount that my GF has told me to get in shape. I have a presidential ribbon in the USNSCC.thare is not much more I can do. I worked out and destroyed my body literally just so I could get in ONE relationship. I am pretty big for my \textbf{age} so I dont regret it and I enjoy it because I can protect my GF from anyone trying to... well you know. If they succeed I would literally hunt them down. It is just what we are taught. Also I forgot to mention, men and women operate on different sides of the brain. Women operate only on the left side so they is incredibly hard to confuse them. But men get confused very easily because our brain is constantly jumping between one side and the other. This is why the education system is unfair towards boys and why it is girls that are seen as the smart ones. Give us credit for what we go through.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut have you ever had a contact with man or not because you act like "I feel that and I think this so everybody is obliged to think and feel the same way" You're talking about things that you have no idea. What if there is no pressure and men just want to be tough and women are happy to be emotional. Wtf? Why it is so hard to belive, what's wrong with you, feminists Why everyone must be oprresed and putted under pressure of society? For example I've been in many "fake" relationships and in each and every one the \textbf{woman} was more caring about  hugging, sweetness and romantic and I cared only about body and if the girl is pretty. Now I'm happy with my true love but as I said there was no pressure on me I simply didn't enjoy hugging and being romantic that much. Of course I was and I had to because the girls wanted that but I can say, in my opinion there was more pressure putted on me to act romantic than to act as a "care only for sex-man". You're suggesting that manly acting is somehow against men. WHY? oh and why did you put that emoji (✿◠‿◠)? Did the \textbf{patriarchy} put pressure on you?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small she is NOT giving the fault to MEN nor women. she is pointing out that SOCIETY is pressuring us... not you as single human being but the whole construction.. it's the "cheerleader or sheep effect" you follow the "norms" you follow what you thing society expects from you. I have 2 brothers and i know they are not sexist assholes who just think about \textbf{sex} but i also know that they are sensitive and struggle a lot in society because of this "strong male" image they have to portray or they would just get beaten up by other "more masculine guys" ..they don't want to be aggressive and dominating but society ( male AND women) build this image of "strong virile \textbf{sex} \textbf{crazy} maniacs in our heads"\textbf{Sexism} IS bad not just for women but it also hurts men. Men can't take pictures of children or show them affection in public without people calling them "pedophiles" right away while women can take pictures of their babies butts kiss them on their lips in public and everyone goes just like "awwww sooo cuuutee"..\textbf{sexism} is bad because it says that women are weak, vulnerable and stupid, so clearly as man you DO'NT want to be associated in any kind of way with those degrading features and try to be the opposite.. which is also wrong. we need to find a balance in the middle.. btw being \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} is the more manly thing i can imagine 2 men having \textbf{sex} with each other? 100 male ..no XX chromosomes involves.. how much manlier could it ever get?\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Crazy, Gay, Sex, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments, Sexual Identity - General, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality & \cellcolor{green!5}8/264 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.03 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small This is hard to hear for me not because your a girl but yeah you have right facts but I should let you know it's not just guys that bully each other I chuckled to a joke and got yelled at by a girl who made the joke and she told me that because it's 2018 that I could hit back a girl in self defence yet a few days earlier I had an argument with another girl who slapped me so obviously I push her back anyway she tells the teacher I get sent in and after saying my side (even with eye witnesses) she still gets me excluded so obviously the joke girl stands up for me right ? No instead she starts bullying me for hitting her back so even if it's true you haven't experienced the half of it you talk about \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} men in your video well from my experience a lot of people just don't care I get that feminism is (somehow) for all genders but this standing around isn't gonna stop a guy with no feelings to suddenly fell them and did you know that the main reason suicide for men is higher because there's never a nice way out "well why don't you tell anyone about this???" Well we will get bulled for it "what joke was it" it was a dark joke about her dead dad that she told her friends and others and seas \textbf{nothing} when they chuckled so I had one "what were you arguing about" she was bullying a guy because he brought in to school an art book so I stud up for him "did you even know these girls" yes on was a friend turned bully joke girl the other an ex girlfriend\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gay, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Sexual Identity - General, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality & \cellcolor{green!27}3/297 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.01 \\  \hline

Equalism ignores all 'differentiating' factors in human beings and creates an equal society - I believe you fit into this ideology rather than feminism which is defined as being the "advocacy of female rights on the grounds of equality of the sexes"; you argue both sides, making you not a defined feminist, but an equalist.

Try asking us what we want rather than assuming what you think they should act and think by using every legal and terroristic threat to make the man a better person.. It doesn't have to be man against \textbf{woman} as the vast majority of the vocal minority thrive on the whole idea that if one gets something then the other is at a disadvantage which isn't the case as each have challenges and each should realize that mandating change will only get the other feeling defensive.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/136 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.735 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@lacigreen You are a good person. But do you know that feminism is not about equality(which the dictionary describes it as).even if we ignore the bragging of feminists about the wage gap and assuming every men are sexist, feminists are humiliating men in more way than you can imagine. Feminists say that men should get permission before even saying "hi" or "You're looking pretty"(if she is looking pretty). Aren't they taking away the freedom of speech from men? And what kind of thinking combines saying "You're gorgeous" with rape culture?Sure some men do some bad things. Some women do even worse things. But my point is, while every feminists are patting themselves on the back, more and more men are being abused by being falsely accused of \textbf{sexism} and \textbf{sexual} harassment by feminists.You know YouTube better than me. Search with the word "feminism",  every video on the YouTube will show you exactly why men hate feminism. it is not because of men hating women or thinking that women are pets of men, but because how feminists actually harasses men(specially white men) without any logical cause. I strongly believe you will support "equality" and not the tyranny of "feminism."

One that knows what to think. But there are some things that men like to do because of our DNA men our just more into sports not because we're pressured into it but because we like watching sports playing sports and stuff like that. Like how a lot of women like to shop. My mom and my brothers girlfriend LOVE to shop. And me and my brother LOVE watching sports.

It's not in your genes. You're not brave, tough, loyal, just because you were born with a dangling bit of flesh between your legs. \textbf{Gender} is a social construction, and you should read about it because asserting what male or female should be doesn't help anyone. Really. I hear it we men don't like to be wrong. Well, just grad a book, just look up all these things you think you know, and maybe you'll experience an epiphany.

So, by definition, it needs a system where the "oppressor" group holds the majority of positions of power and uses them to upheld the oppression.Second: feminists aren't saying "Women, don't look after your children, make men do it". They're saying "Women, you don't HAVE to obligatorily be the parent who looks after your children. You and your husbands aren't abnormal if your husband is the look-after-the-children one".Third: prove that women look after children and men are more aggressive because biology.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Dario Carraresi 1. No, wrong. Simply plainly wrong.Here is the Wikipedia definition of \textbf{sexism}: "\textbf{Sexism} or \textbf{gender} discrimination is prejudice or discrimination based on a person's \textbf{sex} or \textbf{gender}."\textbf{Sexism} doesn't require stucures of oppression; that's feminist propaganda.Using your logic, since there is no institutional oppression against women and very little against men, there could be no \textbf{sexism}. This is a dangerous mentality, since it invalidates sexist oppression that is not based on an institution; and this happens to both sexes.2. Well, women are better fit to do it, see 3. Doesn't mean that you are doing it wrong when the man looks after the children; and in some cases the man might actually be better fit to do so. But in most cases you waste potential with this.3. Men have higher levels of testosterone; it has been shown to make them more aggressive. It also increases the three-dimensional thinking and the physical strengh.You can see this by watching little boys play. They will tend to play more active games.Women (biologically speaking) have one purpose, and that is birthing children. Despite the obvious facts (they have breasts, for instance), women are more social, they tend to be interested in people rather than things.This can be shown a few different ways. Firstly, a study has shown that babies (who have not been indoctrinated tend to look at different pictures for different amounts of time. While boys preferred technical objects, girls preferred faces.Secondly, women are more likely to wake up from high-pitched noises. This is due to her having to care for her children, who cry in a high-pitched noise.Thirdly, despite all the effort to get women into STEM fields, they prefer other, more social jobs, like media. Even when women do go into STEM fields, they tend to choose fields like psychology, where the focus is on human interaction.You litterally have to indoctrinate boys to behave like girls and the other way around.Was that proof enough?\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender, Sex, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}6/336 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.786 \\  \hline

You know, from the guys who actually study that shit: [LINK] And my point still stands. You literally cannot compare systemical oppression with someone occasionally discriminating you.And yes, there is systemic oppression against women. For starters, the vast majority of position of power (political, economical, religious, mediatic) are held by men. The only explanations possible are either (A) women are prevented from entering those positions due to discrimination; or (B) women are intrinsically inferior to men, in every way. Which one do you think is more probable?Second example: look at how many laws there are to regulate what men can do to their own bodies. Then look at how many laws there are to regulate what women can or cannot do with their won bodies - specifically, all the restrictions on pregnancy and abortion.About higher male aggressiveness: I have a question.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Dario CarraresiI will deal with your points one by one. This will be a looooong comment...1. "First of all, here's the definition of \textbf{sexism} from a sociological point of view. You know, from the guys who actually study that shit:"You think that this:"I know, the big 'S' word. \textbf{Sexism}. It seems abrasive \& maaaybe hyperbolic. Bra-burn-y and outdated. It can feel boolean and accusatory. Hang with me though, please."is meant to be serious scientific work? You've got to be kidding me.Look, I don't care about whether someone has studied something. My former geography teacher had studied, and she would litterally believe you if you told her that "of two C-atoms, one turns around to form an O-atom and CO2. Then the energy is squeezed out of the CO2" in a presentation on how a coal-fired power plant works (I didn't make this up, I promise. This really happened).I only care about whether something is logical and scientific or not, and the article (which is not a definition, by the way) you linked is clearly not.What I mean by this is thata) the article's content is unfalsifyable, thus unscientific.- "Point 1: Systemic \textbf{Sexism} has \textbf{nothing} at all to do with the values we identify ourselves with."Meaning that even if we don't personally encounter systemic \textbf{sexism}, it still lurks around the next corner. There is no falsifying this term.- "Repeat: systemic \textbf{sexism} is a problem of culture."Once more an unfalsifyable statement, since it is specifically designed to not allow for individual experiences to logically falsify the statement.- "Systemic \textbf{Sexism} is not about you. Ever."b) it is based on circular reasoning, thus is not logically valid.- "If you can accept that there is \textbf{sexism}, that is a systemic problem due to historic discrimination (c.f. Part 1), then you can begin to see why it can be so difficult to identify and challenge."Meaning that you first have to accept it in order to see it. This is not scientific, this is faith, this is religion.- "[...] that we need to accept [...]"- "Saying 'No, you can't do that!' is Patriarchal."c) It is based on certain beliefs that have not ever been shown to even exist.- "We do though, need to each be accountable to systemic \textbf{sexism}'s perpetuation, passive acceptance, or elimination."- "‘The \textbf{patriarchy}' does not refer to a male conspiracy to seize power, but a society that privileges men."Do you get what I am trying to say with this? I am not saying that they didn't study. I am saying that they are wrong, and if they aren't then they have yet to deliver convincing evidence for their position. Instead, all I ever hear from them is pseudo-scientific bullshit like the article you linked.2. "And my point still stands. You literally cannot compare systemical oppression with someone occasionally discriminating you."Firstly: Yes you can. All systemical oppression must always be based on single cases of discrimination.And secondly, you are yet to provide me with any kind of evidence of systemical oppression. Please note that I am not comparing occasional with systemical \textbf{sexism}. I am denying the existence of systemical \textbf{sexism}.If you want me to agree with you, be a good \textbf{gender} studies student and show me the evidence (see 3. [edit: and 4.])!3. "And yes, there is systemic oppression against women. For starters, the vast majority of position of power (political, economical, religious, mediatic) are held by men. The only explanations possible are either (A) women are prevented from entering those positions due to discrimination; or (B) women are intrinsically inferior to men, in every way. Which one do you think is more probable?"This is a black-and-white fallacy, but whatever. Are you aware of the fact that 75 of the homeless are male? Are you aware of the fact that most of the really shitty jobs are male-dominated? That 93 of the fatal work accident victims are men? Would you like to see more women die at work, since men hold the privilege to do it?What this actually shows are three things (neither A nor B, sorry).a) Men tend to take higher risks than women. Testosterone is again the important factor. But when men take higher risks than women, the logical consequence is that there are more men who succeeded and climbed higher than women - and there are more men who failed. See male suicide rates, for instance.Even if this effect wasn't shown to exist, wouldn't that be a much more conceivable model to describe reality than establishing a \textbf{patriarchy} that favors men over women at all cost?b) Men tend to prioritize higher positions more than women (and no, not because of the word "bossy") while women tend to aspire a socially comfortable surrounding at work.c) Men's intelligence is more broadly spread over the spectrum, while the standard deviation for women is smaller. This means more \textbf{dumb} men than \textbf{dumb} women - and more intelligent men than intelligent women.I'm glad you at least didn't bring up the over and over and over refuted \textbf{gender} wage gap.4. "Second example: look at how many laws there are to regulate what men can do to their own bodies. Then look at how many laws there are to regulate what women can or cannot do with their won bodies - specifically, all the restrictions on pregnancy and abortion."You know the answer, right? You can't not know the answer.There are about equally many rights about what men and women can't do with their bodies. If they use their body to choke someone, for instance, they will go to prison. Both (well, the \textbf{woman} for about 40 of the time, but hey, \textbf{patriarchy}).The only thing women are restricted on is abortion. Men can't get pregnant. You see how your comparison is false, don't you?The thing that makes abortion much more complicated than feminists think it is is that there is a third human life or the potential of a human life involved. Don't you see why that makes things complicated?!5. "About higher male aggressiveness: I have a question. Do you get offended when women are wary of men in general and about the risk of rape in particular?"Why do you ask that question? I don't care who is offended by what.I find it offensive when a \textbf{woman} calls me a potential rapist. So to answer your question: No.But who cares? Is that the kind of argument they teach you in \textbf{gender} studies class?6. Your "about toys" article doesn't make a statement, it only expresses a wish.7. "And no, you don't have to "indoctrinate" boys to make them play with the "wrong" toy. In fact, calling a boy "girly" beause he plays with dolls can be considered proof of social pressure on boys to remain a stereotypical "boy"."What about the studies I talked about? That even infants who haven't been socialized show a sex-specific difference in interests? What about the fact that in every society since hunters and gatherers boys and girls were treated differently? A giant \textbf{patriarchy} conspiracy by the people of the stone \textbf{age}?8. "Suuuuuuuure. That must be why they were the tribe's gatherers back in the day."I was explicitly talking about biological roles. NOT SOCIAL ONES!9. "About STEM: first, here's two examples of biases against women."No, the first study shows \textbf{nothing} at all. It shows bias against women when there is no other information available - which makes sense, since most women aren't as good in STEM. With information about the qualification of a \textbf{woman}, the odds change drastically: [LINK] The second study is not really credible, since it states that"Both parties assume that \textbf{gender} bias does not exist without actually testing for it in a lab. Therefore, the outcome of Moss-Racussin's study is shocking."without recognizing that the burden of proof is on the positive claim, in this case the one that \textbf{gender} bias exists.It also shows very manipulative imagry like this: [LINK] Don't tell me that's scientific.10. "When women move en masse into a jobfield, the wages of that jobfield drop"Did you actually ever study anything? Do the words "supply" and "demand" tell you something? If there is a high supply for labour with a low demand for it, then the wages will decrease! I bet that the same goes for men en masse moving into one job, only this sounds way less dramatic.I took a look at the article you linked, and holy shit, that is one biased author!

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@ScienceTube > is meant to be serious scientific work? You've got to be kidding me.If you want, there's this, cited from the previous link. [LINK] Or this. [LINK] > Look, I don't care about whether someone has studied something. My former geography teacher...Congratulations for missing the point by a mile. If you need information about, say, geography, you ask geographers. One geographer may be incompetent. But let me ask you this: is your experience with your former geography teacher justification enough to dismiss out of hand the general stance of geographerS out of hand?> What I mean by this is that a) the article's content is unfalsifyable, thus unscientific.So is evolutionary theory. [LINK] Evolutionary theory and \textbf{patriarchy} have both a metric shitton of evidence backing them up, and next to no valid objection that could bring up a valid counter-theory.> "Point 1: Systemic \textbf{Sexism} has \textbf{nothing} at all to do with the values we identify ourselves with."Meaning that even if we don't personally encounter systemic \textbf{sexism}, it still lurks around the next corner.Why, YES. If you personally don't experience the existance of X, it doesn't mean that X doesn't exist. The fact that you live in a society where there's discrimination against women on a systemic level means that you will be affected by said society, either negatively or positively, and that you will internalize sexist behaviours. For example, from the source:"I contribute to systemic \textbf{sexism} each time I tell a little girl how cute I think her outfit is. How pretty she looks. How big and important an adorably outfitted little boy looks. By always/only going to work with full makeup, a nice coif, and in some kind of formal-ish work attire (unless it's obviously a costume/act). By asking a \textbf{woman} colleague to be less Bossy, before questioning why I'm uncomfortable with her assertive behavior.See that? The author knows about \textbf{sexism} and \textbf{gender} roles, and she stills treats women and men differently. A girl is "pretty" (looks), a boy is "important" (personal value). She keeps going to work in full makeup, because it's proper for a working \textbf{woman} to be pretty, while the men have to be important. A \textbf{woman} colleague is bossy when a man colleague who does the exact same is "assertive". And so on.> c) It is based on certain beliefs that have not ever been shown to even exist.See the above. And that's the behaviours of a \textbf{woman} who is actively against such sexist behaviours. They're learned. They're ingrained. But she tries to remove them.> "‘The \textbf{patriarchy}' does not refer to a male conspiracy to seize power, but a society that privileges men."> Do you get what I am trying to say with this? I am not saying that they didn't study. I am saying that they are wrong...So, in other words, you don't believe that there's a difference in how this society treats men and women differently. Random example: when was the last time there was a law specifically aimed at limiting men's body autonomy? Because there have plenty to limit women's - see: pregnancy and abortion.> 2. "And my point still stands. You literally cannot compare systemical oppression with someone occasionally discriminating you."> Firstly: Yes you can. All systemical oppression must always be based on single cases of discrimination.False. If it's just one person who's biased, you can solve it through social means - for example: if you think you have been treated unfairly by your employer because she thinks that men are more aggressive and thus less reliable, you can ask a judge to fix that. But if such bias is widespread on a social level, it's very likely that the judge will decree that there was no bias - that you've been judged fairly.> And secondly, you are yet to provide me with any kind of evidence of systemical oppression. Please note that I am not comparing occasional with systemical \textbf{sexism}. I am denying the existence of systemical \textbf{sexism}.So, you'd have to deny rape culture, the \textbf{gender} wage gap, the lack of representation in media (besides as eye candy), all of the following... [LINK] ...and all the other axis of oppressions. Like \textbf{racism}.> This is a \textbf{black}-and-white fallacy, but whatever.A "\textbf{black} and white fallacy" is such if I (A) give you only two possible explanations, (B) pretend that only those two explanations are valid, and (C) I know that B is false.> Are you aware of the fact that 75 of the homeless are male?Are you aware that that statistic only works if you consider single homeless adults, while completely ignoring homeless adults with children to take care of? [LINK] Are you aware that a substantial share of homeless adults are veterans? Don't you think that such a distribution would have less to do with supposed \textbf{sexism} against men and more to do with how shittily we treat veterans? [LINK] > Are you aware of the fact that most of the really shitty jobs are male-dominated?Like sewer work? [LINK] Or mining? [LINK] > That 93 of the fatal work accident victims are men?1st - It's because there are more men than women in those jobfields. One of the reasons for that is that women are harassed out of those jobfields.2nd - This is an issue of safety regulations and have them applied, via actually punishing the companies who don't abide instead of giving them a slap on the wrist. [LINK]  [LINK] > a) Men tend to take higher risks than women.Irrelevant. Jobs with higher risks don't have a higher pay. Moreover, men who aggressively negotiate their own salaries tend to be offered more money that the men who don't, but the women who aggressively negotiate their salaries in the exact same way are penalized in comparison to the women who don't. We've come back to the previous: men are "assertive" and women "bossy"  for the exact same actions. [LINK] > b) Men tend to prioritize higher positions more than women...Irrelevant to whether or not there's a bias. (There is.)> c) Men's intelligence is more broadly spread over the spectrum...And such a minimal difference in IQ distribution explains the massive differences in job position how, exactly? [LINK]  [LINK] Especially since there's still a bias, that you haven't disproven?> I'm glad you at least didn't bring up the over and over and over refuted \textbf{gender} wage gap.Since you had to mention it... even if we confront a white man and a white \textbf{woman} doing the exact same job for the exact same amount of time and with the exact same efficiency, there's STILL a 7 difference. And that's if we ignore differences in how the same aggressive negotiation is treatedm hiring biases, promoting biases, motherhood penalty (aka "She's going to raise a family, therefore she's going to leave her career to take care of the children because that's what women do, right? Therefore, I won't bother giving her promotions since she's gonna lieave soon."), women being harassed out of "male" jobfield, and the fact that "female" jobfields drop in prestige and wage for no reason other than \textbf{sexism}. And all of that for white women, nevermind \textbf{black} or Latina... You know the answer, right? You can't not know the answer. There are about equally many rights about what men and women can't do with their bodies.False. See: restrictions on abortion.> Both (well, the \textbf{woman} for about 40 of the time, but hey, \textbf{patriarchy}).First: that "40" smells of bullshit. Sure that you took in account differences of circumstances?Second: there IS a sentencing gap, yes, but it's due to male judges. The higher the percentage of female judges in a judicial district, the lesser the gap goes. Hell, it has been speculated that a 100 female judges population in a district would result in harsher sentences to women. [LINK] > The thing that makes abortion much more complicated than feminists think it is is that there is a third human life or the potential of a human life involved. Don't you see why that makes things complicated?!Roe vs. Wade. \textbf{Nobody} except the owner's body has any right to decide what happens to said body. In the same way \textbf{nobody} can force you to donate your kidney even if there's someone right now who needs it, \textbf{nobody} should force a \textbf{woman} to keep a fetus in her body and undergo 9 months of pregnancy. The fetus can't survive outside of the \textbf{woman}'s body? That person cannot survive without your kidney.> "About higher male aggressiveness: I have a question. Do you get offended when women are wary of men in general and about the risk of rape in particular?"> Why do you ask that question? I don't care who is offended by what. I find it offensive when a \textbf{woman} calls me a potential rapist.But men are more aggressive than women. You've said so. Isn't that justification enough to distrust men, especially since (A) rape is widespread; (B) you can't know who is a rapist and who isn't until they try to rape you; and (C) women are constantly told to be careful and to protect themselves from rape, and are blamed if they are raped and didn't follow all of the precautions?> 6. Your "about toys" article doesn't make a statement, it only expresses a wish.From that article I've linked to: how \textbf{gender} roles influence kids, including what toys they (openly) play with. [LINK] Bullying against children who don't conform. Because again: rigi \textbf{gender} roles. [LINK] Boys and girls already have a good idea of which jobs are "for boys" and which are "for girls" (link was broken in the original article): [LINK] How said rigid \textbf{gender} roles can harm boys: "boys should be interested in action or violence, not books". [LINK] > I was explicitly talking about biological roles. NOT SOCIAL ONES!Then your entire talk about jobs is completely useless.> No, the first study shows \textbf{nothing} at all.The first study has shown that "employers", when asked to pick between a man and a \textbf{woman}, pick 2 men for every \textbf{woman}. And when they made a "mistake" (picked the less capable candidate - they took a test beforehand to gauge their efficiency), up to 90 of the time it was because they picked the less capable man over the more capable \textbf{woman}. Moreover, even when the "employers" were allowed to know the candidates' results, the hiring gap wasn't eliminated, but only reduced.> The second study is not really credible, since it states that "Both parties assume that \textbf{gender} bias does not exist without actually testing for it in a lab. Therefore, the outcome of Moss-Racussin's study is shocking." without recognizing that the burden of proof is on the positive claim, in this case the one that \textbf{gender} bias exists.And they proved it. The Yale University studio was thus: they sent various resumes to various STEM faculties. The catch: all the resumes sent to a specific faculty were word-by-word identical except the applicant's name, and split 50/50 across the genders. Results: "women" were called back less often and offered kless money than men. We're talking about a 4.000\$/year difference.Also, about that Williams \& Ceci study: [LINK] > 10. "When women move en masse into a jobfield, the wages of that jobfield drop"> Did you actually ever study anything?Did you actually checked the link I gave you?

"is your experience with your former geography teacher justification enough to dismiss out of hand the general stance of geographerS out of hand?"No, that's not my point. My point is that people who have studied are often wrong, and certainly not necessarily right.2. "So is evolutionary theory."Are you a creationist? Even the rationalwiki page you linked shows ways how to disprove evolution.What I showed is that the article's content is unfalsifyable, that it's impossible to disprove. That is unscientific.3. "Evolutionary theory and \textbf{patriarchy} have both a metric shitton of evidence backing them up, and next to no valid objection that could bring up a valid counter-theory."I have given you a valid counter-theory to \textbf{patriarchy}.

"The author knows about \textbf{sexism} and \textbf{gender} roles, and she stills treats women and men differently. A girl is "pretty" (looks), a boy is "important" (personal value)."Despite this being no objection to my point, it is a complete nonsense. The author claims that this is systemic \textbf{sexism}.NO!

"Moreover, men who aggressively negotiate their own salaries tend to be offered more money that the men who don't, but the women who aggressively negotiate their salaries in the exact same way are penalized in comparison to the women who don't."There is a risk in negotiating salaries.

"even if we confront a white man and a white \textbf{woman} doing the exact same job for the exact same amount of time and with the exact same efficiency, there's STILL a 7 difference."I should have been silent. You are trying to make me rage, aren't you?The reason for the wage gap (and figures vary between 3 and 7, by the way) is that men are four times more likely to ask for raises than women. There are so many reasons, don't you see it can't be \textbf{patriarchy}?There are even laws against \textbf{gender} discrimination, they already exist, there is no \textbf{gender} discrimination towards women!15. "women being harassed out of "male" jobfield, and the fact that "female" jobfields drop in prestige and wage for no reason other than \textbf{sexism}."Show me the fucking evidence! Show me the evidence that there is no other reason than \textbf{sexism} behind lower wages for female job fields. It might be that women have other wishes than men, but NO that would be sexist, it must be the \textbf{patriarchy}!Fucking moron.16. "In the same way \textbf{nobody} can force you to donate your kidney even if there's someone right now who needs it,"False analogy. I am not saying that everyone should have to do everything possible to take every chance of human life being created. With this logic you could force random people to have \textbf{sex}, I am not \textbf{dumb}.What I say is that you are actively killing a human being. Would you be ok with killing an infant because the mother doesn't want to undergo a lifetime of parenthood?Now, don't misunderstand me, I do think that there should be a reasonable opportunity to decide against the child while it is little more than a clump of cells. But ita) shouldn't be portraied in a positive way andb) shouldn't be possible for more than a month or so.17. "Isn't that justification enough to distrust men, especially since (A) rape is widespread; (B) you can't know who is a rapist and who isn't until they try to rape you; and (C) women are constantly told to be careful and to protect themselves from rape, and are blamed if they are raped and didn't follow all of the precautions?"I myself said that my personal feelings are not important, didn't I?A) About 0.05 a year ( [LINK]  is not widespread. And the trend is decreasing.B) True.C) Not true. Noone is blamed for not following the precautions. You know, the people who are "blaming" the victims are usually people who think not emotionally but rationally. And there is no rational use in blaming the victim. There is, however, a very real use in pointing out what the victim could have done to protect herself so others can prevent getting raped.18. Your "about toys" response:You just assume that there are \textbf{gender} roles influencing the children's behaviour and that those \textbf{gender} roles influence them even before they were socialized. This is what's called an unfalsifyable theory, it is not scientific, and there is no evidence to back it up. It's just a belief.Like Hitchens said: "What can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence." The fact that he was talking about creationism should tell you something.19.

There was no significant change in demand and supply. What changed is that previously a job was predominantly filled with men, and afterwards it got predominantly filled with women."I did look at the article for a little moment, but it was so biased I didn't bother to read.However, even if supply and demand are constant, there are variables, like: The women were new to the job, women tend to prioritize a social environment over a high wage, etc.You simply can't blame \textbf{patriarchy} for everything!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Dumb, Gender, Nobody, Nothing, Patriarchy, Sex, Sexism, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}32/1656 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.932 \\  \hline

As I said, I will not take links as an argument."I'm not gonna even bother to look at what you're saying, because I've already decided it's all bullshit".> .I just don't have the time and motivation to just read everything you throw at me..."I have the time to write a 23-point list, but not the time to give even a cursory glance at what you took hours to research and write".> ...considering how biased your sources have proven in the past."I've already decided that your sources are wrong on the basis of their origin, without providing any proof that those sources are biased OR that what they're saying is true or false".1. No, that's not my point. My point is that people who have studied are OFTEN wrong, and certainly not necessarily right.Emphasis mine. So, your point really IS "I met someone who was educated and wrong, therefore I'm going to assume that those who are educated are wrong".2 > What I showed is that the article's content is unfalsifyable, that it's impossible to disprove. That is unscientific.Except for literally all the cases of biases against women which prove the existance of systemic \textbf{sexism} against women, as seen below. Your problem with "\textbf{patriarchy}" is the same one creationists have with "evolution": "I'm not seeing it happening RIGHT NOW, therefore it doesn't exist".3. I have given you a valid counter-theory to \textbf{patriarchy}. If there was a \textbf{patriarchy}, would you not expect that it takes action to protect its privilege? If you were suppressed, my privileged friend, you would probably be dead or in jail by now.So, what you're saying is that if I'm not killed, then there is no oppression. Being paid less for no reason other than your \textbf{gender} is not oppression. Being valued not as a person but as a pretty toy is not oppression. Being denied your bodily autonomy is not oppression. Strange world, the one you live in.4. > Despite this being no objection to my point, it is a complete nonsense.Nope. It points out that you get sexist behaviours and ideas ingrained on you whether you want it or not, because you grew up in a society that is sexist.> The author claims that this is systemic \textbf{sexism}.Nope. It's part of systemic \textbf{sexism}.> NO! It's not. This is not oppression, this is biology. Women are judged more on their look than men because biology!Prove it. And keep in mind: if "biology" is the right answer, explain:A) How come the standards of beauty change across different cultures. Human biology doesn't drastically change across different cultures.B) How come the standards of beauty change in the same culture with time. Human biology doesn't drastically change in mere centuries.5. "A \textbf{woman} colleague is bossy when a man colleague who does the exact same is "assertive"." Not true.It IS true. See: women who aggressively negotiate their salaries are penalized compared to those who don't, but men who aggreassively negotiate their salaries in the exact same way are advantaged compared to the men who don't. [LINK] > Irrelevant. This is no business of yours, and none of mine. If a \textbf{woman} can't handle being called bossy, she isn't fit for leading positions. Period.The issue here isn't "being able to handle being called bossy". The issue here is "women are penalized for certain behaviour, while men aren't".7. "Random example: when was the last time there was a law specifically aimed at limiting men's body autonomy?"> I will redirect here when you answer my objection to your pregnancy example.In other words, there isn't any situation where men - men specifically - had their bodily autonomy threatened.> Since men can't get into the situation where they have control over other people than themselves.Then explain why they're trying to pass laws to limit women's bodily autonomy.8. > ...rape culture objectively simply doesn't exist - everyone knows rape is wrongFirst: way to misunderstand what "rape culture" is. It means a culture where:A) Rape is present, and is widespread. For example: Mary Koss found out that 10-15 of college women have been victims of at least one completed rape, via physical violence, threats of physical violence, or intoxication. (And "intoxication" is defined as being so intoxicated you CANNOT oppose or object to it). [LINK] The NIJ/CDC puts the statistic for all american women at 14 (18 if we include attempted rape). [LINK] The Dpt. of Justice \textbf{Sexual} Victimizations of College Women says 10 have been victim of a completed rape - but only considers rape by force. [LINK] The NWS indicates that at least 13 of American women have been victims of at least one rape. [LINK] B) Male \textbf{sexual} violence is "normalized", aka treated as something unchangeable. Boys bully girls? They want to know her. Men catcalling women? Normal male behaviour. Rapists? Well, rapists are rabid animals, and you cannot reason with them, so it's up to women to protect themselves make sure rapists rape the \textbf{woman} who hasn't followed all instructions prefectly.> and if you had seen the Ghostbusters trailer, replacing an originally male-played film legend with all women, you can't tell me that women aren't represented.Yes, I can. Because pointing to ONE film, or even a DOZEN film with a female cast means jack shit when the VAST MAJORITY of movies doesn't have equal representation. [LINK] > Of course, if you dismiss all women you don't like as "eye candy", you will get to a point of underrepresentation. I smell conformation bias.In other words: being treated almost exclusively as eye candy with a few actual characters in the mix is a totaly fair representation of women, and doesn't treat women as pretty props at all.> It's all whiny nonsense. If you want female protagonists in video games, then go program video games!Except that (A) women are pushed away from programming, due to social pressures, biases, harassment... [LINK] ...and (B) women who make videogames are harassed because of that. [LINK] > If you want female lead roles in movies, then go make fucking movies!See the above.> By the way, don't ever again mention the "97 of rapists don't even spend a day in jail" joke. If they didn't spend a day in jail, they weren't convicted. If they weren't convicted, they weren't rapists. Fucking IDIOT.Except that the rapes still happened. 97 of rapes have no conviction. By your logic, if you can't find who stole your wallet, your wallet was never stolen and you lied about it being stolen."But anonymous survey" - explain why someone who wants to "ruin a man's life with a false accusation" would falsely claim to have been raped in an anonymous survey when (A) you won't be named and (B) you can't accuse anyone of being your rapist.9. "On an average night in the 23 cities surveyed, 94 percent of people living on the streets were single adults [...]", quote from the page you linked. Case closed.You missed this bit (emphasis mine):On an average night in the 23 cities surveyed, 94 percent of people living on the streets were single adults, 4 percent were part of families and 2 percent were unaccompanied minors.  Seventy percent of those in emergency shelters were single adults, 29 percent were part of families and 1 percent were unaccompanied minors.  Of those in transitional housing, 43 percent were single adults, 56 percent were part of families, and 1 percent were unaccompanied minors.  Those who occupied permanent supportive housing were 60 percent single adults, 39.5 percent were part of families, and .5 percent were unaccompanied minors (U.S. Conference of Mayors, 2008).Also, I've noticed how you DID have the time to skim my links.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@ScienceTube Part two:10. What in hell are you talking about? When I can beat you with your own sources you are doing something wrong.Way to miss the point, which is: there ARE women who want to do dirty, dangerous "male" jobs, and they're discriminated against because they're women.11. "Or that women don't want to work in those job fields? That they are physically weaker and therefore less qualified? Nah, certainly \textbf{patriarchy}.See the above. Harassment and discrimination against women miners exists. This is a fact. You haven't disproven that fact.> Also, let's apprechiate for a moment that you litterally say you want more women in jobs with high rates of fatal injuries.No, I've said that women shouldn't be discriminated because they're women.Also, please be clear: do you want more women in mining (and thus, you should be against women miners being harassed), or you don't want more women in mining (and thus losing all rights to whine that only men have to do mining)?12. But at some point, you can't climb higher with a risk-averse strategy. So in order to get to the top, you have to take risks.Like aggressively negotiating your salary, as already discussed back at point 5?13. There is a risk in negotiating salaries. Women tend not to take it. It's their own choice. Don't blame \textbf{patriarchy} for their free choices.Except that the issue here isn't "women don't negotiate as often as men"; it's "when women DO negotiate, they're disadvantaged, when men aren't disadvantaged when they apply the exat same behaviour". By the way: this unequal treatment is the reason women don't negotiate their salaries as often as men.14. The reason for the wage gap (and figures vary between 3 and 7, by the way) is that men are four times more likely to ask for raises than women.Even taking THAT in account, there's STILL that 7. And that's for white women, mind.> There are even laws against \textbf{gender} discrimination, they already exist, there is no \textbf{gender} discrimination towards women!Guess what's also illegal? Meth. Guess what hasn't magically disappeared from this planet? Meth.Moreover, one such reasons why the wage gap is so high is biases against women. Women are considered less efficient than men for the same work - I've already shown you multiple examples, so this isn't up to debate. And this is at a social level, which means that not only is the employer biased (and thus valuing women's work as 8 when they'd value a man 10 for the exac same job), but also the judge and the juries that are supposed to see if the employer was fair or not (and since they're biased too, they'll see the \textbf{woman} job as 8 too).15. "women being harassed out of "male" jobfield, and the fact that "female" jobfields drop in prestige and wage for no reason other than \textbf{sexism}." Show me the fucking evidence! Because it has happened at literally every jobfield that got filled with women. Additionally, they've found multiple evidence of devaluation (women go in jobfield, then jobfield's value and wages start to drop), but not of queing (jobfield's value and wages drop, then women start going in jobfield). [LINK]  [LINK] 16. "In the same way \textbf{nobody} can force you to donate your kidney even if there's someone right now who needs it," False analogy.Nope. \textbf{Nobody} can force you to donate your kidney to someone else even if that's literally the only thing that can save that someone's life. In the same way, \textbf{nobody} can force you to go through pregnancy even though terminating the pregnancy will result in the fetus' death.> What I say is that you are actively killing a human being. Would you be ok with killing an infant because the mother doesn't want to undergo a lifetime of parenthood?Except that the infant is an independent being who doesn't completely depend on the mother's organs to survive, and who doesn't drastically causes a medical condition in the mother, unlike a fetus.Now, don't misunderstand me, I do think that there should be a reasonable opportunity to decide against the child while it is little more than a clump of cells. But ita) shouldn't be portraied in a positive way... Then you 're in favor for mandatory organ donation. Not donating organs results in lives being lost.> ...and b) shouldn't be possible for more than a month or so.Why? Within the first trimester, the fetus has no brain, no awareness, and cannot feel pain. Moreover, a quarter of all pregnancies self-terminate within the first trimester.And to prevent a possible objection: Canada has no limits on when you can terminate your own pregnancy. Do you know how many late-term abortions there have been in Canada for birth control? Literally \textbf{zero}.17. [Rape is] About 0.05 a year ( [LINK]  is not widespread. And the trend is decreasing.In the USA, it's roughly 1 in 6 over a lifetime. And yes, rape does cause life-lasting consequences.> Not true. Noone is blamed for not following the precautions.False. [LINK] Here's a recent example. [LINK] Here's multiple examples of police forces dismissing rape victims because they were drunk or "there wasn't enough proof" (they didn't even bother to investigate), respectively in New Orleans, Baltimore, Lincolnshire (UK), Philadelphia, and D.C.: [LINK]  [LINK]  [LINK]  [LINK]  [LINK] > There is, however, a very real use in pointing out what the victim could have done to protect herself so others can prevent getting raped.Multiple problems with that:A) It tells the victim that it was also their responsability. If they only did A or didn't do B, they wouldn't have been raped. This shame is one of the primary factors why rape is so underreported.B) They don't work. For example: what you wear (clothing has only incidence on rape in regards to whether the victim will be said of "having asked for it") or distrusting strangers (over 70 of rapes are committed by someone known by the victim);C) They're massively limiting of women's social lives - and unfairly so. Men are the majority of victims of physical assault and murder, but I don't see people telling men to not go alone at night or not drink, and sure as fuck I don't see men being blamed if they did those things and got attacked;D) Even if they did work, all they would do is to displace the rapist's attention to some other victims. "Good girls don't get raped, so be a good girl so that the bad girl gets raped in your place";E) When women DO observe all of those "safety advices" the way they're intended, they're treated as paranoid man-haters.> 18. Your "about toys" response: You just assume that there are \textbf{gender} roles influencing the children's behaviour and that those \textbf{gender} roles influence them even before they were socialized.Except that \textbf{gender} roles, by definition, are learnt through socialization, whether with other children, your parents, or th world aroud you (for example: how girls' toys value beauty and appearance while boys' toys value action).> This is what's called an unfalsifyable theory, it is not scientific, and there is no evidence to back it up. It's just a belief.Except that (A) it has been repeatedly shown that such \textbf{gender} roles influence children (society shapes those who grow up in it whether they want it or not) as indicated by the proofs I brought you, and (B) it IS falsifiable. All you'd have to prove is that biology is a primary factor that trumps over nurture.20. Actually, [the \textbf{gender} wage gap] wasn't reduced but reversed. See the study I linked.I saw it. I also saw the rebuttal I gave you. That study has multiple problems in its methodology, goes directly against multiple studies that show the opposite, and it only considers a situation with hyper-qualificated candidates, completely ignoring the vast majority of hiring processes.21. I did look at the article for a little moment, but it was so biased I didn't bother to read.Biased how, exactly? Be specific. The source has little to no bearing on whether what is said in that article is true or not.Moreover: I've already shown you that almost certainly it's women get into a jobfield first and afterwards the wages drop, not the other way around.

Because there were cases when there wasn't!1. Should've studied professional misunderstanding. I said that studying doesn't prevent you from being wrong; and, in my opinion, \textbf{gender} studies encourages you to be wrong.2. Are you joking? Do I even need to call false analogy on that one?Evolution is a process that takes millions of years to happen. This is the reason why we can't observe it in ten seconds.\textbf{Patriarchy} is a condition. A condition doesn't have a limit in time. If there was \textbf{patriarchy}, you would expect to see its effect, wouldn't you?Yet I am still waiting for that \$100,000 male privilege bonus, and I am still waiting to hear of a \textbf{woman} who is truly oppressed.3. You are making one strawman argument after the other. I didn't say you can't be oppressed if you haven't been killed, I say you don't know what a real oppressive system looks like.You know, dear privileged friend, an oppressive system usually doesn't invite its opponents in for a cup of tea. An oppressive system is called oppressive because it oppresses different opinions. But your opinion I hear way too frequently for this to be true.To your points:a) If you are paid less than another person for sexist reasons only, then this is obviously oppression. Now that I think about it, this might perhaps be the reason why it's illegal to do this.If you are paid less than a co-worker for no other reason but \textbf{sexism}, don't cry about it on the internet, go to the police!b) If you are valued less, this is not oppression. You may find it offensive. But that doesn't mean you're oppressed.c) If you were denied your body autonomy for no reason, that would be oppression, yes.Thankfully, there is a reason, and I have told you repeatedly.Don't you think that the protection of a human life, of your child's life, is more important than what you feel like this day?4. "It points out that you get sexist behaviours and ideas ingrained on you whether you want it or not, because you grew up in a society that is sexist."Let's all take a moment to appreciate the beauty of this piece of circular reasoning.No, seriously, don't you see that your argument looks like this (almost literally):Assumption: Society is sexist.Conclusion: Society is sexist.Is that what they tell you about scientific work in \textbf{gender} studies class? Well... you're wrong :-)As for your A) and B), provide me with your sources, so I can pick them apart.Fact is, even \textbf{blind} people perfer the body proportions we usually refer to as "sexy". How have they been indoctrinated by \textbf{patriarchy}?5. Don't lie. People are penalized for certain behaviour. This is called risk. If someone penalized you unfairly, then don't cry, go to the police.There are laws against such discrimination, in case you didn't get it.7. You fucking moron, don't you get it when I say it the first five times? Giving women "full autonomy over their body" would mean legalizing the planned murder of children. Are you one of these feminists who says you should be able to abort one minute before birth?Why did you ignore my comparison of murdering your baby? Why don't you want to allow women to murder their babies if they are too loud for them, or if they simply decided that they don't want to be a parent? EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE!Now, to be fair, I think that a \textbf{woman}, under certain circumstances, should be able to abort in the first few days without medical necessity. But this is already allowed in all western countries I can think of, so what are you fighting for?8. A) These statistics are indeed a problem; they are a problem to victims of real rape, not feminist "you cannot object this is rape" rape.I cannot object to this? Ok. I won't. I will simply list some things from the study.1. "Have you given in to \textbf{sex} play [...] when you didn't want to because you were overwhelmed by a man's continual arguments and pressure?"2. "Have you had \textbf{sexual} intercourse because you didn't want to because a man gave you \textbf{alcohol} or drugs?"3. "[...] but intercourse didn't occur."By these standards, every man is a rapist. No wonder why feminists hate men so badly ("killallmen").This study has been criticized for having a false target group, little to no data to verify the women's claims, and a small sample size. You do see why a policy based on such pseudo-scientific bullshit could be a problem?B) "Male \textbf{sexual} violence is normalized."BULLSHIT."Boys bully girls?"You mean teasing her? Yeah, very problematic indeed. Noone accepts actual bullying, but I have a feeling that you are not talking about actual bullying."Men catcalling women?"You mean men making unwanted compliments to women on the street? Or even "stare raping" her? Yes, these are just animals, they should be immediately shot! How dare they even speaking up to women, these parasites!"the VAST MAJORITY of movies doesn't have equal representation."How about you just going out and making all-\textbf{woman} films then? It's probably going to flop, since noone wants to see problematic topics in entertainment, but it'll be worth a lot more than your \textbf{gender} studies degree!See, there is a reason for why there are mostly men in these films. They - play in the past, with women playing little role in society. - display war in some form - normal life is too boring to make films out of it - and the average soldier is a man, due to his superior body strengh. - are directed at a male audience, just the same way romantic comedies are directed at a female audience. - are re-makes of \textbf{old} stories and don't feel like replacing beloved characters with women for no reason.There certainly are other possible reasons that I didn't list here, too."women are pushed away from programming"Citation please?!"due to social pressures, biases, harassment..."These are not reasons, honey. Life is hard. If you don't want to deal with social pressures, you do so out of free choice.And let's not forget that most of this pressure comes from women..."...and (B) women who make videogames are harassed because of that."You choose GamerGate as an example for that, huh? You fail to understand that people like Sarkeesian aren't criticized (they aren't harassed at all - they are disagreed with) because they are women, they are criticized because they talk shit.That 97 statistic is clearly unscientific and probably false. Why would you participate in an anonymous survey? Because you feel cheated on? Because you want to express your hatred in any way you can (hatred is rarely rational)?Because you are a troll?Why would you take an anonymous survey that shows such a one-sided result and call it fact? Police report or it didn't happen.9. I never said that I wouldn't look at your sources, see above.That still doesn't account for anything, does it? Show me what part - of all the homeless - are females, and cite your sources. Then we can continue.10. You mean they can't do the job because they are less physically strong than men.11. "This is a fact. You haven't disproven that fact."Nor have you proven it.I don't want women there, nor do I not want women there. I want the most qualified person to get the job, and I don't think that there are many women qualified for it.12. Not only that, but taking other risks, maybe changing your employer or something.13. You contradict yourself there, did you notice? Show me that this is the reason why women don't negotiate salaries.They don't. End of story. When they are discriminated against, they can sue the employer.There are laws against such behaviour. What do you want?14. "Even taking THAT in account, there's STILL that 7. And that's for white women, mind."Show me peer-reviewed scientific evidence.Again, you assume that there is \textbf{gender} bias, and what you see is, surprise, \textbf{gender} bias. This is not how it works.15. Well, given that this was true, it can't be caused by discrimination against women, no matter what. Do you even know that young, childless women outearn young, childless men, even though they don't negotiate salaries and don't ask for raises?There is a multitude of reasons for why this could be the case; one would be the matter of supply and demand (which is not disproven in the article, by the way - the study seems very biased, given the citations in the article), the fact that women tend to choose a socially comfortable environment over high wages, the fact that women moved into a job field and obviously had no experience in it; etc. etc.The fact that the study immediately assumes \textbf{sexism} to be the cause shows how unscientific this is.16. "Except that the infant is an independent being who doesn't completely depend on the mother's organs to survive, and who doesn't drastically causes a medical condition in the mother, unlike a fetus."If there is a medical reason for it, abortion is already legal. Did you not notice that?I am not talking about medical reasons. I am talking about the worth of a human life; a life you would actively end by aborting it. In the civilized non-social justice warrior world we call this murder.A fetus minutes before birth is practically the same as a baby a few minutes after birth. Would you allow murdering the baby if the mother decides that she doesn't want it? Because that would be called insanity."Then you 're in favor for mandatory organ donation. Not donating organs results in lives being lost."No, I'm not, you fucking moron. Not taking an action which leads to the death of a person is different from actively murdering a person.If the first trimester is such a good limit to set, so be it. If you can give valid reasons, then I'm fine with it.But I need to comment on your Canada argument. Because you do realize that this doesn't at all support your claim, don't you? It is only a good example because it isn't used. If it was used once, it would be immoral. So why allow something when it mustn't be used?17. A) You would need to show the latter, but to the first point: Is it really worth not taking measures for other women at the cost of a little self-blame for the victim? They probably automatically self-blame.B) That's why people like thunderf00t (who was harshly criticized by feminists for that unspeakable action) suggested things like confidence instead.C) No, they don't. They tell the \textbf{woman} to be careful. Not to be paranoid.That's a dilemma not only women face. Everyone has to choose whom to trust and whom not to trust.D) Show me the evidence for your thesis that rapists always rape, even if they don't have an easy, unsecure target.E) No, they are treated as careful women.18.

Either prove it, or drop the argument.> "\textbf{Patriarchy} is a condition. A condition doesn't have a limit in time. If there was \textbf{patriarchy}, you would expect to see its effect, wouldn't you?" - And we see it. See: \textbf{gender} pay gap, rape culture, lack of representation, et cetera and cetera.Moreover: nowhere it has been said that \textbf{patriarchy} is impossible to spot. It has been said that those who benefit from it often don't see it. Example: you claimed that now women have equal representation in movies because of the upcoming Ghostbusters movie. Meaning: you believed that representation was almost equal, and that it got equal with a single movie with an all-female cast. However, this is not the case: in the 500 top movies of 2007-12, only 11 had an equally split cast, and only 31 of characters were female. Moreover, 29 of female characters wore sexually revealing clothes on-screen, and 26 were at least partially naked. (Male characters: 7 and 9 respectively.) [LINK] This is undeniable. But you didn't notice it. Because you believed we already had equality. And women don't have it - not even in this fabled West World. [LINK] > "Yet I am still waiting for that \$100,000 male privilege bonus..." - Men earn 1.3\$ for every dollar a \textbf{woman} makes due to a combination of: higher chance to get hired (biases against women), higher chance to get promoted (same), getting more money if you aggressively negotiate your salary (while women twho do the exact same are penalized for that), getting more promotions if you have a family to take care of (women are penalized regardless of whether they'll be the stay-at-home parent or the bread-winning one), and the fact that "women's job" are devalued and lose wages for no reason other than the fact that there's more women who do that job than the men. Men are at a much lower risk of being victims of domestic and \textbf{sexual} violence than women - and they are the vast majority of perpetrators of said violence. And that's just two big ones.> "...and I am still waiting to hear of a \textbf{woman} who is truly oppressed." - Let me guess, the \textbf{old} "There are women in the Middle East that have it worse than you, so shut up Western \textbf{woman}". Also known as the "There are women in the farmlands that have it worse than you, so shut up Muslim \textbf{woman}". Also known as the "There are women who are killed or disfigured by their husbands, so shut up Muslim farmland \textbf{woman}". And, conveniently, the killed women can't speak up in the first place, so the problem is solved.Hey. Guess what? Not only that bullshit is designed to silence women; not only it's stupid, because people can care about multiple issues, not just the issue they happen to be talking about in this microinstant; not only it bases itself on the "white savior who educates third world countries" myth that has literally never worked in history; not only everyone who's made this same argumen chides western feminists for "wasting time on Western issues", without realizing that they themselves are "wasting time" chiding western feminists instead of helping third world countries; but it's also factually wrong. Here, have some infographs on issues that affect women in the West world. [LINK] > "I didn't say you can't be oppressed if you haven't been killed, I say you don't know what a real oppressive system looks like." - According to you, being paid way less, raped way more, and have your bodily autonomy threatened isn't oppression. That much is clear.> "...an oppressive system usually doesn't invite its opponents in for a cup of tea. An oppressive system is called oppressive because it oppresses different opinions." Right on cue. For you, the only valid oppression is being jailed or killed. Also, you're seriously saying that after seeing how often feminists are vilified and while vilifying feminists yourself. So precious.> "Now that I think about [paying women less for the same work as men], this might perhaps be the reason why it's illegal to do this." - And the fact that such oppression is technically illegal means jack shit if it's still massively present.> If you are paid less than a co-worker for no other reason but \textbf{sexism}, don't cry about it on the internet, go to the police!" - Except that the police is part of the system, supergenius. Think about it: if women's work of 10 is valued 8, and if employers pay women 8 because they believed they worked 8, don't you think that the police will also look at the women's job and say "No, the employer is right, this work is only a 8"?> "Circular reasoning" - That's a spectacularly bad lie. Let's see again what I wrote: "It points out that you get sexist behaviours and ideas ingrained on you whether you want it or not (effect), because you grew up in a society that is sexist (cause) ." The effect is proven to be true: there are multiple examples of sexist behaviours even from epeople who are aware of living in a sexist society. The cause is also true, because there's literally a metric ton of evidence that proves that there's systemic oppression against women.And while we're at it, let's get this out of the way: \textbf{patriarchy} = systematic oppression (1) that privileges men and oppresses women (2). Both are falsifiable - respectively: "There is no system where men are in charge" and "there is no oppression against women".Beauty standards:Beauty standards changing across cultures: [LINK] Beauty standards changing over time: [LINK] Abortion: "legalizing the planned murder of children" - There have been \textbf{zero} late-term abortions for birth control in Canada. \textbf{Zero}. \textbf{Zilch}. Nada. You're whining about an issue that literally doesn't exist.Also, about restricting women's rights to abortion: have you seen the situation in the USA? [LINK] > "A life you would actively end by aborting it" - Except that such life is heavily affecting the mother's health without her consent. But you don't give a shit about women, so that's expected.> "In the civilized non-social justice warrior world we call [abortion] murder" - Nope. If forbidding a person from using someone else's organs to survive is "murder", then donating organs should be mandatory for everyone. Which means that, if someone needs a kidney and your kidney is compatible, by your own logic you have no right to say "no". Negating your kidney would result in someone else's death, which would be murder according to your own logic.> "Would you allow murdering the baby if the mother decides that she doesn't want it? Because that would be called insanity." - Point to ONE example of a \textbf{woman} wanting to kill a baby a few minutes before birth. I'll accept any case from 1850 onwards.And keep in mind: abortion isn't the murder of an embryo/fetus/baby, it's the termination of a pregnancy. Know what's the best course of action for terminating a pregnancy a few minutes before giving birth? Wait those few minutes and give birth.Rape: Let's make it easier for you and restrict ourselves to the Mary Koss one. THESE are the questions about completed rape - a "yes" to one of these three questions means that the respondent has been victim of at least one completed rape (all the other questions are for different degrees of \textbf{sexual} assault, from \textbf{sexual} contact to attempted rape):8. Have you had \textbf{sexual} intercourse when you didn't want to because a man gave you \textbf{alcohol} or drugs?9. Have you had \textbf{sexual} intercourse when you didn't want to because a man threatened or used some degree of physical force (twisting your arm,  holding you down, etc.) to make you?10. Have you had \textbf{sex} acts (anal or oral intercourse or penetration by objects other than the penis) when you didn't want to because a man threatened or used some degree of physical force (twisting your arm, holding you down, etc.) to make you?Moreover, question 8 was remade because it was objected that it was too broad and misleading.Rev. 8. Have you engaged in \textbf{sexual} intercourse when you didn't want to but were so intoxicated under the influence of \textbf{alcohol} or drugs that you could not stop it or object? [LINK] Guess what? There was no significant change in the results. Meaning that the original question wasn't misleading. Now, explain what's your problem with the definitions of rape used by Koss (9, 10 and the revised 8). Also, explain why you've ignored the other three studies that replicated Koss' findings (except for the \textbf{Sexual} Victimizations of College Women one, who only looked for rape via physical violence or threats of it, not via intoxication, and which statistics of rape by force match the results of Koss).> ""Male \textbf{sexual} violence is normalized." BULLSHIT. "Boys bully girls?" You mean teasing her? Yeah, very problematic indeed. Noone accepts actual bullying, but I have a feeling that you are not talking about actual bullying. "Men catcalling women?" You mean men making unwanted compliments to women on the street? Or even "stare raping" her? Yes, these are just animals, they should be immediately shot! How dare they even speaking up to women, these parasites!"Emphasis mine. You keep proving me right - you're making up as if women's complaining are all hysterical. They're worrying over \textbf{nothing}, right? They're whining about perfectly normal male behaviour, right?Here's the statistics on the reporting rates of rape. [LINK] Also, prove that the anonymous survey about unreported rape was invalid. Specifically, prove that:A) The researchers did NOT exclude patently false answers;B) The respondents lied because they hated all men. (I doubt that someone who wants to ruin one specific lie with a false accusation would lie about having been raped in an anonymous survey where you can't accuse your rapist or cause him any legal or social consequence.)> "Why would you take an anonymous survey that shows such a one-sided result and call it fact? Police report or it didn't happen." Ah, yes, "Police or STFU". Except for all the times where the police dismissed or disbelieved rape victims, as I've already shown you. Why bother to report your rape to the police if all you're gonna get is to be called a liar and being harassed by the police because they believe (wrongly) that you're a liar? (And yes, I've already brought you ample proof of how the police mishandles rape cases. Either disprove it, or accept it.)About "safety advices to not get raped":A) Translation: "I know you're probably blaming yourself for the horribly traumatic experience that happened to you, but could you please blame yourself even more, adding on to the trauma and making more sure that you're too ashamed to report your rape, all for something that does jack shit to reduce the chances of being raped? Thanks". [LINK]  [LINK]  [LINK] B) Prove that it works. Until then: it's yet more responsibility on the victims.C) But men don't have to worry about being accused of "having asked for it" or "actually wanting it" if they're assaulted or murdered.D) You're expecting women to be not "easy and unsecure" all the time?E) Uh-huh. What are your thoughts on this? [LINK]  [LINK] Representation in media: "Movies about social issues flop" my ass. [LINK] Re. your "reasons" why there aren't so many female characters:1) Women still existed in those past societies, and some even had important roles despite everything. And if you're talking about fictional stories, then your argument crumbles istantly.2) Explain what "superior body strength" has to do with using a gun. Or why agility and intelligence aren't factors. Or why movies like Mad Max Fury Road even exist.3) Women pay for 50 of the tickets. "Directed at a male audience" my foot.4) Re. Ghostbusters reboot: because an all male, all white main cast is perfectly reasonable. Oh, wait, that's what's normal, according to you.The homeless: Show me what part - of all the homeless - are male. Cite your source, since you've completely failed to do that thus far.Women being penalized for aggressively negotiating: [LINK] Already brought this source, multiple times now. Are you actually going to address the fact that men are advantaged while women are penalized for the exact same aggressive negotiation, or are you gonna stay firmly lodged in your own ass?Women in programming: Here's a few examples of what happens to women in programming. [LINK]  [LINK]  [LINK]  [LINK] "Harassment is just how life is" - no,harassment is overwhelmingly aimed at women. So what you really mean is "Women being harassed is normal, but men being harassed is not, suck it up and don't you dare complaining 'cause I don't want to be inconvenienced by your whining, much less by any attempt to actually fix this issue".Citation needed about harassment against women in "male" jobfields coming primarily from other women.And GamerGate is, and always was, a concerted campaign to harass women, since the very beginning. [LINK] Women in "male" jobs: Women in both mining and sewer work are harassed. Harassment isn't caused by differences in efficiency - it's caused by \textbf{sexism}. I can dig up proof of harassment in other "male" jobfields (fire fighting, the army... you name it).> I don't want women there, nor do I not want women there. I want the most qualified person to get the job, and I don't think that there are many women qualified for it. - So, you're perfectly fine with men making up the vast majority of workplace deaths. Because, according to you, men are the most qualified to those jobs, therefore they should be the majority of those who work in there and the majority of those who DIE in there.Also: why do you think it's more fair for the harassed to leave their jobs, instead of making the harassers stop harassing?"Female" work being devalued: The researchers found next to no proof of "queuing" (women are attracted by jobfields with low pay, therefore when a job loses prestige and wages, women pour in) but much evidence of "devaluing" (women get into a jobfield, they're paid less, the job loses its prestige because it's low-pay). [LINK] \textbf{Gender} pay gap in general: All the sources are cited in the report. [LINK] > Well, given that this was true, it can't be caused by discrimination against women, no matter what. Do you even know that young, childless women outearn young, childless men, even though they don't negotiate salaries and don't ask for raises?Prove it. And make sure you take in account differencies in education, jobfield and efficiency.\textbf{Gender} roles: The falsification of "every difference between boys and girls must be due to social influence" is "there's biological influence that causes a difference between boys and girls".Moreover, that's not what I've said. What I've said is that social influence trumps over biology. The falsification of that would be "Biology has a bigger effect for differences in behaviour between boys and girls than social factors".

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@ScienceTube  > For just one moment, I thought you may have brought up an argument that can hold water scientifically. And now you re-affirm that the only reason you believe in this is that you first of all assert that your conclusion has to be true? How disappointing.Let's hear your explanation then.- You've prepared a bunch of resumes to send to various STEM faculties.  All the resumes sent to a specific faculty (for example, math) are about a neo-laureate student in that specific field, and they're all word-by-word identical except for the name and \textbf{gender} of the "applicant".- You then send the resumes to various top research-intensive universities in the USA, as appropriate ("math" resumes sent at math universities, etc.), asking the professors there to evaluate the students' competence, the likeliness of them being hired in their own university, how much they'd pay them if they were hired, and how willing they would be to mentor them.- Results: all the faculties show that they value women as less competent than men (roughly 15 less, on average), less likely to hire women (-20), less likely to mentor women (-15), and offer less money (-4.000\$/year).Please explain what other possible reason there is for this disparity, besides \textbf{sexism}. Prove that men face harassment as much as women. I've brought multiple proof of the harassment and biases women face. Why were you incapable of proving the opposite?> A) I am not talking about the queuing theory.Irrelevant to whether or not "women's work" is devalued.>   I am talking about the fact that women favor family friendly and socially comfortable working conditions over high wage. Except that there still are hiring biases, promoting biases and motherhood penalties.>   Of course, if women don't demand as much pay as men would, wages decrease. Except that women are less likely to be hired if they ask for more money. Specifically, male employers are less likely to hire a \textbf{woman} who demands for more money than a \textbf{woman} who asks for less, but are more likely to hire a man who does the exact same thing over a man who doesn't ask for much.> Not to mention that women are less likely to ask for raises.See the above.> Also, I don't really care about the prestige part, since it is a) a subjective matter and b) obviously not really representative of the rest of the world (there is a lot of jobs without much prestige that are male-dominated).Except that it's relevant to the \textbf{gender} wage gap. Specifically, if whatever job women choose is paid less because it's seen as "women's work" and thus less deserving of pay, then it's a problem. There's no rational reason that a job that's male-filled and an equivalent one in terms of effort and risks that's female-filled to be paid differently.Let me put it this way: let's suppose that all the jobs suddenly get their wages cut by 0,1 for every 1 of men in it. You would be fine with that, right?> Are you aware that women are a majority?Are you aware that women are not a majority of positions of power?Are you aware that anyone non-man, non-hetero, non-cis, non-able, non-rich is not a majority of positions of power?>   They have every single legal right, opposed to men who are subject to legal discrimination. Double bullshit: legal rights don't magically make inequality disappear if they aren't applied; and men aren't subjected to legal discrimination because they're men.> 1) That was not well worded. I was talking about the general notion that \textbf{gender} and \textbf{race} and LGTBQrestofalphabet equality must be given in numbers of the cast in order to make a "good" movie. And the Ghostbusters remake was clearly a sign for that.Except that's not what has been said. What is been said is to stop giving a tiny minority - white, cis, hetero, able-bodied men - the vast majority of representation.Actually, I am aware of it and don't view it as a problem. Is it a problem? Tell me why.Because it's (A) unfair and (B) it causes a significant loss of self-esteem. Which I have already addressed, and that you blatantly ignored.And it's not all female characters. Take the famous TV series Game of Thrones. Nearly all female characters are "sexualized" in some form - but still they have worth as characters.Look at the bolded part. Now look at how many male characters in GoT are "sexualized" in some form. Spoilers: they aren't "all", or even a "majority".Now look at literally every kind of media in the past 20 years.> And this is a problem because? Besides the term "sexualized" being so broad that it could mean anything, this is due to biology.PROVE IT. And prove that culture isn't a factor. I already gave you the links, do your goddamn job.Also: it's good to know that you'd be perfectly fine if I treated you solely on the basis of your physical aspect.Men tend to like looking at women more than women like looking at men.> And these movies you are describing are usually directed at a male audience.Except that I'm talking about the top 500 movies in 2007-12. Half of the tickets were bought by women. floosh There goes your unsourced bullshit. > Do you understand the concept of a self-fulfilling prophecy?Do you understand the proven fact that lack of representation causes a loss in self-esteem, or are you one of those people who believe that the lack of evidence that a conspiracy exists is proof that there's a conspiracy because they're censoring every piece of evidence possible that such a conspiracy exists?> Who is whining about the lack of representation? I am just pointing out that you are wrong. But this is an ad hominem anyway, so whatever.Women are pointing out that they aren't represented. You, on the other hand, don't think that's an existing problem, and are so offended that someone brings up a problem that (only in your view) doesn't exist.  "> Whines that there is ONE movie with an all-female cast." Ad hominem attack and strawman, impressive. I did not complain about the all-female cast. You complained about a Ghostbusters movie that just so happened to have an all-female cast, for no reason other that it had an all-female cast. Yet you had \textbf{zero} problems when it was an all-male cast. And yes, that's pretty much the only significant difference.>   Do what you like. But don't expect to produce a good movie with characters not designed to be characters but women... That phrase means absolutely \textbf{nothing}. Having a male or female Ghostbuster makes as much difference as having a blond or brown-haired Ghostbuster. "And I have already shown you ample evidence of how there are biases against hiring women [...]"> Actually, no. We are talking about politics.So you're gonna move the goalposts because you can't deny that there's biases against women. 'lright. Here: [LINK]  [LINK]  [LINK]  [LINK]  And now, here's the first part of the comment that, you claim, cannot see. General discussion of \textbf{patriarchy}:> "Should've studied professional misunderstanding. I said that studying doesn't prevent you from being wrong; and, in my opinion, \textbf{gender} studies encourages you to be wrong." - Third time where you insinuate that those who have studied social matters are wrong. Either prove it, or drop the argument.> "\textbf{Patriarchy} is a condition. A condition doesn't have a limit in time. If there was \textbf{patriarchy}, you would expect to see its effect, wouldn't you?" - And we see it. See: \textbf{gender} pay gap, rape culture, lack of representation, et cetera and cetera.Moreover: nowhere it has been said that \textbf{patriarchy} is impossible to spot. It has been said that those who benefit from it often don't see it. Example: you claimed that now women have equal representation in movies because of the upcoming Ghostbusters movie. Meaning: you believed that representation was almost equal, and that it got equal with a single movie with an all-female cast. However, this is not the case: in the 500 top movies of 2007-12, only 11 had an equally split cast, and only 31 of characters were female. Moreover, 29 of female characters wore sexually revealing clothes on-screen, and 26 were at least partially naked. (Male characters: 7 and 9 respectively.) [LINK] This is undeniable. But you didn't notice it. Because you believed we already had equality. And women don't have it - not even in this fabled West World. [LINK] > "Yet I am still waiting for that \$100,000 male privilege bonus..." - Men earn 1.3\$ for every dollar a \textbf{woman} makes due to a combination of: higher chance to get hired (biases against women), higher chance to get promoted (same), getting more money if you aggressively negotiate your salary (while women twho do the exact same are penalized for that), getting more promotions if you have a family to take care of (women are penalized regardless of whether they'll be the stay-at-home parent or the bread-winning one), and the fact that "women's job" are devalued and lose wages for no reason other than the fact that there's more women who do that job than the men. Men are at a much lower risk of being victims of domestic and \textbf{sexual} violence than women - and they are the vast majority of perpetrators of said violence. And that's just two big ones.> "...and I am still waiting to hear of a \textbf{woman} who is truly oppressed." - Let me guess, the \textbf{old} "There are women in the Middle East that have it worse than you, so shut up Western \textbf{woman}". Also known as the "There are women in the farmlands that have it worse than you, so shut up Muslim \textbf{woman}". Also known as the "There are women who are killed or disfigured by their husbands, so shut up Muslim farmland \textbf{woman}". And, conveniently, the killed women can't speak up in the first place, so the problem is solved.Hey. Guess what? Not only that bullshit is designed to silence women; not only it's stupid, because people can care about multiple issues, not just the issue they happen to be talking about in this microinstant; not only it bases itself on the "white savior who educates third world countries" myth that has literally never worked in history; not only everyone who's made this same argumen chides western feminists for "wasting time on Western issues", without realizing that they themselves are "wasting time" chiding western feminists instead of helping third world countries; but it's also factually wrong. Here, have some infographs on issues that affect women in the West world. [LINK] > "I didn't say you can't be oppressed if you haven't been killed, I say you don't know what a real oppressive system looks like." - According to you, being paid way less, raped way more, and have your bodily autonomy threatened isn't oppression. That much is clear.> "...an oppressive system usually doesn't invite its opponents in for a cup of tea. An oppressive system is called oppressive because it oppresses different opinions." Right on cue. For you, the only valid oppression is being jailed or killed. Also, you're seriously saying that after seeing how often feminists are vilified and while vilifying feminists yourself. So precious.> "Now that I think about [paying women less for the same work as men], this might perhaps be the reason why it's illegal to do this." - And the fact that such oppression is technically illegal means jack shit if it's still massively present.> If you are paid less than a co-worker for no other reason but \textbf{sexism}, don't cry about it on the internet, go to the police!" - Except that the police is part of the system, supergenius. Think about it: if women's work of 10 is valued 8, and if employers pay women 8 because they believed they worked 8, don't you think that the police will also look at the women's job and say "No, the employer is right, this work is only a 8"?> "Circular reasoning" - That's a spectacularly bad lie. Let's see again what I wrote: "It points out that you get sexist behaviours and ideas ingrained on you whether you want it or not (effect), because you grew up in a society that is sexist (cause) ." The effect is proven to be true: there are multiple examples of sexist behaviours even from epeople who are aware of living in a sexist society. The cause is also true, because there's literally a metric ton of evidence that proves that there's systemic oppression against women.And while we're at it, let's get this out of the way: \textbf{patriarchy} = systematic oppression (1) that privileges men and oppresses women (2). Both are falsifiable - respectively: "There is no system where men are in charge" and "there is no oppression against women".\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender, Nothing, Old, Patriarchy, Race, Sexism, Sexual, Woman, Zero & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s, Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}23/2181 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.055 \\  \hline

Nada. You're whining about an issue that literally doesn't exist.Also, about restricting women's rights to abortion: have you seen the situation in the USA? [LINK] > "A life you would actively end by aborting it" - Except that such life is heavily affecting the mother's health without her consent. But you don't give a shit about women, so that's expected.> "In the civilized non-social justice warrior world we call [abortion] murder" - Nope. If forbidding a person from using someone else's organs to survive is "murder", then donating organs should be mandatory for everyone. Which means that, if someone needs a kidney and your kidney is compatible, by your own logic you have no right to say "no". Negating your kidney would result in someone else's death, which would be murder according to your own logic.> "Would you allow murdering the baby if the mother decides that she doesn't want it? Because that would be called insanity." - Point to ONE example of a \textbf{woman} wanting to kill a baby a few minutes before birth. I'll accept any case from 1850 onwards.And keep in mind: abortion isn't the murder of an embryo/fetus/baby, it's the termination of a pregnancy. Know what's the best course of action for terminating a pregnancy a few minutes before giving birth? Wait those few minutes and give birth.Rape: Let's make it easier for you and restrict ourselves to the Mary Koss one. THESE are the questions about completed rape - a "yes" to one of these three questions means that the respondent has been victim of at least one completed rape (all the other questions are for different degrees of \textbf{sexual} assault, from \textbf{sexual} contact to attempted rape):8. Have you had \textbf{sexual} intercourse when you didn't want to because a man gave you \textbf{alcohol} or drugs?9. Have you had \textbf{sexual} intercourse when you didn't want to because a man threatened or used some degree of physical force (twisting your arm,  holding you down, etc.) to make you?10. Have you had \textbf{sex} acts (anal or oral intercourse or penetration by objects other than the penis) when you didn't want to because a man threatened or used some degree of physical force (twisting your arm, holding you down, etc.) to make you?Moreover, question 8 was remade because it was objected that it was too broad and misleading.Rev. 8. Have you engaged in \textbf{sexual} intercourse when you didn't want to but were so intoxicated under the influence of \textbf{alcohol} or drugs that you could not stop it or object? [LINK] Guess what? There was no significant change in the results. Meaning that the original question wasn't misleading. Now, explain what's your problem with the definitions of rape used by Koss (9, 10 and the revised 8). Also, explain why you've ignored the other three studies that replicated Koss' findings (except for the \textbf{Sexual} Victimizations of College Women one, who only looked for rape via physical violence or threats of it, not via intoxication, and which statistics of rape by force match the results of Koss).> ""Male \textbf{sexual} violence is normalized." BULLSHIT. "Boys bully girls?" You mean teasing her? Yeah, very problematic indeed. Noone accepts actual bullying, but I have a feeling that you are not talking about actual bullying. "Men catcalling women?" You mean men making unwanted compliments to women on the street? Or even "stare raping" her? Yes, these are just animals, they should be immediately shot! How dare they even speaking up to women, these parasites!"Emphasis mine. You keep proving me right - you're making up as if women's complaining are all hysterical. They're worrying over \textbf{nothing}, right? They're whining about perfectly normal male behaviour, right?Here's the statistics on the reporting rates of rape. [LINK] Also, prove that the anonymous survey about unreported rape was invalid. Specifically, prove that:A) The researchers did NOT exclude patently false answers;B) The respondents lied because they hated all men. (I doubt that someone who wants to ruin one specific lie with a false accusation would lie about having been raped in an anonymous survey where you can't accuse your rapist or cause him any legal or social consequence.)> "Why would you take an anonymous survey that shows such a one-sided result and call it fact? Police report or it didn't happen." Ah, yes, "Police or STFU". Except for all the times where the police dismissed or disbelieved rape victims, as I've already shown you. Why bother to report your rape to the police if all you're gonna get is to be called a liar and being harassed by the police because they believe (wrongly) that you're a liar? (And yes, I've already brought you ample proof of how the police mishandles rape cases. Either disprove it, or accept it.)About "safety advices to not get raped":A) Translation: "I know you're probably blaming yourself for the horribly traumatic experience that happened to you, but could you please blame yourself even more, adding on to the trauma and making more sure that you're too ashamed to report your rape, all for something that does jack shit to reduce the chances of being raped? Thanks". [LINK]  [LINK]  [LINK] B) Prove that it works. Until then: it's yet more responsibility on the victims.C) But men don't have to worry about being accused of "having asked for it" or "actually wanting it" if they're assaulted or murdered.D) You're expecting women to be not "easy and unsecure" all the time?E) Uh-huh. What are your thoughts on this? [LINK]  [LINK] Representation in media: "Movies about social issues flop" my ass. [LINK] Re. your "reasons" why there aren't so many female characters:1) Women still existed in those past societies, and some even had important roles despite everything. And if you're talking about fictional stories, then your argument crumbles istantly.2) Explain what "superior body strength" has to do with using a gun. Or why agility and intelligence aren't factors. Or why movies like Mad Max Fury Road even exist.3) Women pay for 50 of the tickets. "Directed at a male audience" my foot.4) Re. Ghostbusters reboot: because an all male, all white main cast is perfectly reasonable. Oh, wait, that's what's normal, according to you.The homeless: Show me what part - of all the homeless - are male. Cite your source, since you've completely failed to do that thus far.Women being penalized for aggressively negotiating: [LINK] Already brought this source, multiple times now. Are you actually going to address the fact that men are advantaged while women are penalized for the exact same aggressive negotiation, or are you gonna stay firmly lodged in your own ass?Women in programming: Here's a few examples of what happens to women in programming. [LINK]  [LINK]  [LINK]  [LINK] "Harassment is just how life is" - no,harassment is overwhelmingly aimed at women. So what you really mean is "Women being harassed is normal, but men being harassed is not, suck it up and don't you dare complaining 'cause I don't want to be inconvenienced by your whining, much less by any attempt to actually fix this issue".Citation needed about harassment against women in "male" jobfields coming primarily from other women.And GamerGate is, and always was, a concerted campaign to harass women, since the very beginning. [LINK] Women in "male" jobs: Women in both mining and sewer work are harassed. Harassment isn't caused by differences in efficiency - it's caused by \textbf{sexism}. I can dig up proof of harassment in other "male" jobfields (fire fighting, the army... you name it).> I don't want women there, nor do I not want women there. I want the most qualified person to get the job, and I don't think that there are many women qualified for it. - So, you're perfectly fine with men making up the vast majority of workplace deaths. Because, according to you, men are the most qualified to those jobs, therefore they should be the majority of those who work in there and the majority of those who DIE in there.Also: why do you think it's more fair for the harassed to leave their jobs, instead of making the harassers stop harassing?"Female" work being devalued: The researchers found next to no proof of "queuing" (women are attracted by jobfields with low pay, therefore when a job loses prestige and wages, women pour in) but much evidence of "devaluing" (women get into a jobfield, they're paid less, the job loses its prestige because it's low-pay). [LINK] \textbf{Gender} pay gap in general: All the sources are cited in the report. [LINK] > Well, given that this was true, it can't be caused by discrimination against women, no matter what. Do you even know that young, childless women outearn young, childless men, even though they don't negotiate salaries and don't ask for raises?Prove it. And make sure you take in account differencies in education, jobfield and efficiency.\textbf{Gender} roles: The falsification of "every difference between boys and girls must be due to social influence" is "there's biological influence that causes a difference between boys and girls".Moreover, that's not what I've said. What I've said is that social influence trumps over biology. The falsification of that would be "Biology has a bigger effect for differences in behaviour between boys and girls than social factors".

Your objection amounts to basically "There's still a really small chance that the answer is not \textbf{sexism}, so no matter how evidence there is, I'll keep saying that it's not about \textbf{sexism}". It's hyperskepticism, pure and simple.> In fact, what is with the counter study I have linked you to that tells that women are treated just about equal in all the fields you talk about?Already addressed. The study directly contradicts multiple studies that demonstrate the opposite, and is itself unreliable.> You've brought up some examples like GamerGate, of which I have to conclude that "harassment" of women means "disagreement" and "calling them a liar if they lied" in the civilized world.Nope. GamerGate was about \textbf{nothing} but harassment. You want an example? Let's talk about what sparked GG - Zoe Quinn.- A disgruntled boyfriend of Quinn claimed that she slept with reviewers in order to have positive reviews, and thus have more people buy her game, Depression Quest. Key word being claimed - there was \textbf{zero} proof of that.- In fact, the only reviewer that may have slept with her did NOT write any review about her game. [LINK] - Moreover, the provided motive makes no sense, as Depression Quest is a free game. Quinn got \textbf{zero} money from it.- Quinn received harassment and death threats, not "criticism". [LINK] - In fact, GG was about harassing Quinn from the very beginning, and only later claimed to be for "ethics in gaming journalism" in an attempt to whitewash itself clean from the accusations of being a hate machine. It didn't work. [LINK]  [LINK]  [LINK] - Despite GG's claim of being about "ethics in gaming journalism", only Quinn received harassment and death threats. The reviewers who, according to GG, accepted \textbf{sex} as bribery in exchange for positive reviews? \textbf{Nothing}.> Men are faced with just as much harassment as women are, perhaps even more.Prove it. Until then, \textbf{poof} dismissed.The devaluation of women's work is relevant. The fact that a job gets paid less than another that requires the same amount of skill and effort for no reason other than the fact that there's women in the former and men in the latter is evident proof of sexist bias.And yes, "devaluation" also includes a drop in salaries. And yes, it has been proved that it's because women poured in. It has also been found that there's next to \textbf{zero} evidence for your theory - that women are attracted by low-pay jobs. "Police or STFU" - by your same logic, men aren't sentenced to harsher sentences than women. If they were, they'd complain to the legal system about the inequality.Also: no, the proof is valid. There is bias against women in all fields of STEM, not just engineering; there's bias against women who aggressively negotiate their own salaries in all fields (while men are rewarded for the same behavior); there's biases against mothers in all fields (while fathers are more likely to get promotions).> "Let me put it this way: let's suppose that all the jobs suddenly get their wages cut by 0,1 for every 1 of men in it. You would be fine with that, right?"> Yes and no. If it was a natural reaction of the free market...It's not, in the same way the devaluation of women's work has been proven to not be caused by the "free market".> You are really advocating a gender-race-sexuality-identity neutral dictatorship, aren't you?1) White people hold the vast majority of positions of power. The same goes for men. The same goes for hetero people. The same goes for cis people. Et cetera.2) Moreover, they're OVERrepresented. If 10 of Americans are \textbf{black}, then I wouldn't have any problem  if only 10 of American politicians were \textbf{black}. But if there's only 5 of \textbf{black} politicians, then there's evidently something that's skewing the proportions.3) There's multiple evidence of systemic oppression against women, non-white people, non-hetero people, et cetera. This is the null hypothesis. [LINK] > Women don't want to go into politics, that is the reason why they don't.I've already provided you ample evidence of bias against women, including in politics. Claim dismissed because false.> Oh really? Men aren't discriminated against because they're men? I'm so glad to hear that. And I thought that the female quota would actively discriminate against males, stupid me.Except that men already benefit from privilege. Affirmative action is applied to counteract that existing privilege. Your argument basically boils down to "No, \textbf{disabled} people shouldn't get a wheelchair, because able people don't get to have one".> I have listed a bunch of legal issues for men exclusively, examples like a man who was raped and can be sued for child support...So do women. In fact, I brought you this on this matter: [LINK] Also: bring a citation.> And yes, legal rights don't make inequality disappear, but they give everyone equality of opportunities. This is all that matters, so women are fully equal to men on all levels."It doesn't matter that you're oppressed and discriminated, because this piece of paper says that we're equal. Anyway, let me whine about how men are discriminated, despite the fact that I've just said that there can't be any discrimination because we're all equal on paper"."What is been said is to stop giving a tiny minority - white, cis, hetero, able-bodied men - the vast majority of representation."> A TINY MINORITY?!?! Are you joking? We are talking about 45 of the population here!White, hetero, cis, able-bodied men are 45 of the population? Sure.

Now look at how many male characters in GoT are "sexualized" in some form. Spoilers: they aren't "all", or even a "majority"." And this is bad because?Already explained.>   I just showed with this very example that being "sexualized" is not necessarily a bad thing. It can help develope the character, even. The problem is not if one character is sexualized or not. The problem is when the vast majority of female characters are sexualized or used as props. Because it sends the message that women are \textbf{nothing} more than pretty, sexy props. We already went through this.> "Also: it's good to know that you'd be perfectly fine if I treated you solely on the basis of your physical aspect." Nope, strawman, strawman, strawman.It's only a strawman if I don't address what you've actually said.Me: "Except that a third of all female characters in movies are sexualixed - three to four times more often than the male ones."You: And this is a problem because? Besides the term "sexualized" being so broad that it could mean anything, this is due to biology.In other words: you'd have no problem with women treating men as sexualized props, or having the vast majority of male characters treated as sexualized props. Because biology. You don't like that? Prove how, exactly, biology works differently between men and women in this case.> "You complained about a Ghostbusters movie that just so happened to have an all-female cast, for no reason other that it had an all-female cast. Yet you had \textbf{zero} problems when it was an all-male cast. And yes, that's pretty much the only significant difference."First things first, I don't like the trailer. It's not at all funny, and the animations are quite bad for today's technical standards.Funny how you claim that now, after complaining about \textbf{nothing} else but the all-female cast.

But I wasn't talking about the female roles making the movie bad (see above paragraph) but the way they were implemented - just to be politically correct.That phrase means absolutely \textbf{nothing}.

For fuck's sake, we've got the IRC logs that GG made public in an effort to "demonstrate" that GG was about "ethics in gaming journalism". Do you know how many times the words "ethics" and "ethical" appear in that chat log, collectively? 146 times. "Nathan" - the first name of the journalist that allegedly slept with Quinn in exchange for favorable reviews, is mentioned 108 times. "Zoe"? 4778. Quoting from the WHTM article (emphasis mine):I decided to examine each occurrence of the name 'Zoe' in order to see just what 4channers thought of her. After about 6 hours on this particular quest, I've only made it through roughly one-third of the mentions. But the results are not pretty.The 4channers express their hatred and disgust towards her; they express their glee at the thought of ruining her career; they fantasize about her being raped and killed. They wonder if all the harassment will drive her to suicide, and only the thought of 4chan getting bad publicity convinces some of them that this isn't something they should hope for.They gleefully distribute nude pictures of her, posting links to online archives of them and emailing them directly both to Quinn's supporters.They dig up all sorts of information about her and her family and do their best to track down anyone and everyone with even the most tenuous links to her. One industrious researcher even manages to find a picture of Quinn at \textbf{age} 13; while acknowledging that it had no relevance whatsoever to issues of gaming ethics, she posts a link to it anyway.And then there is the ongoing discussion of her vagina, described variously as 'wide,' large enough to 'fit 12 dicks at once, and 'a festering cheese-filled vagina' that leaves 'a trail of cunt slime' wherever she goes. Several 4channers speculate about its smell.It's not clear how exactly the size or shape or smell of Quinn's vagina relates to the high-minded issues of gaming ethics that the GamerGaters are said to be concerned with. But in the IRC log no one ever seems to call out any of those talking about Quinn in the crudest \textbf{sexual} terms.

Her decision to make more videos - and to improve the general quality of her series - came after the funding goal was well surpassed, as a "thank you" to her backers.Moreover, you don't understand how KickStarter works. You have a project, you put it on KS and ask for the money you think you'll need. If the backers give you that sum, you make the product you promised. If the backers decide to give you a LOT more, it's because they thought that your project is a lot more valuable that you thought; and, more importantly, you don't have any obligation to produce anything more than what you promised, nor you have to spend all the money you got to your project.Some people were interested in Sarkeesian's project from the start. Others decided to give her money in support, because of the harassment she faced since when she started her KickStarter. Others still didn't hear about her until GamerGaters didn't make her known because of the harassment they threw at her, and decided that the harassment she faced was proof enough that \textbf{sexism} in gaming exists and is a real issue.

Points out the fact that women received the vote in 1920 (well after men). The first female Supreme Court judge was appointed in 1981. The first female Secretary of State: 1996. There have been discriminatory remarks about Hillary Clinton's \textbf{gender} and appearance (while no  male politician had to be subjected to the same fixation on their body and style). [LINK] 2) LSE US Centre. It's a press release about a study from the piece's author, Cecilia Hyunjung Mo, about hidden biases (via the IAT, Implicit Association Test). Result: if someone believes that women rarely have leadership qualities, then that someone will be unlikely to vote for a female politician, favoring instead a male one even if the two have the EXACT SAME competence, and even if the respondent claims to be in favor of supporting a female candidate. [LINK] 3) Huffington Post. Cites the Hyungjung Mo study, as well as two more studies on implicit biases and one more about how women's lack of visibility and representation directly leads to biases against them. [LINK]  [LINK]  [LINK]  [LINK] 4) The report of the AAUW about the systemic barriers that obstruct women in politics. A few excerpts from the summary: women are only 25 of US State legislators, 19 of members of the Congress, 12 of governors, 28 of executives. For non-white women, the statistics are, respectively: 5, 6, 4 and 5. It indicates blatant \textbf{sex} discrimination, hostile work environments, negative stereotypes about women in leadership, and bias - including implicit bias - as the reasons for this blatant inequality.

(6) We don't give wheelchairs to able people because they can walk just fine; they have no need for a wheelchair.B) (1) Women have a problem: they face bias, being judged as less efficient than men for the same work, and therefore less competent men are hired instead of more competent women. (2) This is unfair, because women have the right to be judged fairly, and to get hired if they're competent enough to get the job. (3) The best solution would be to resolve the cause, in this case sexist biases against women. (4) But changing social beliefs takes time. (5) So, in the meantime we do something to reduce the effects. Namely: we give some women a different hiring queue so that they don't have to face the bias. (6) We don't give affirmative action to men because they don't face sexist biases; they have no need for AA.And yes, men DO benefit from \textbf{sexism}.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Dario Carraresi I was writing the response to your comment, and I realized that you did a few things:1. You re-used \textbf{old} arguments of yours I had already refuted. Our debate has gone in a circle, and I don't see much use in refuting them over and over and over with the same arguments.2. You asked for proof where it is eithera) impossible to give orb) not required.You asked for proof of an explanation; you even ask for proof where the burden of proof isn't on me.I don't think that such an attitude will bring us anywhere.3. If you didn't use the above, you used ad hominem attacks that had no merit but to hurt me personally, and since this is something I do in my spare time, I don't see the necessity to allow for such behaviour.You base your opinion on the belief that there is a \textbf{patriarchy} that oppresses everyone but "cis" straight white men. That this belief actually has an opportunity to exist proves the very opposite, and I have already listed a bunch of problems with this hypothesis.It is kind of sad, really, that, in the \textbf{age} of enlightenment, after we have overthrown religion, people are looking for a new god; and a new devil. Without even realizing what they are doing, they are making their lives unnecessarily hard; and worse, they are making everyone's life harder as well by imposing such absurd beliefs on society.These are the reasons why I will no further take part in this debate.

You asked for proof where it is either a) impossible to give or b) not required.False. The only appliable case was when I directly challenged you about the Yale University study, and that was because you claimed, without any proof to back up your assertion, that the study's results weren't caused by \textbf{sexism}. Which is why I challenged you to bring up an explanation that wasn't "\textbf{sexism}". You failed - because you didn't have any explanation.> ...you even ask for proof where the burden of proof isn't on me.False again. The massive amount of links and sources I provided is proof of that. You, on the other hand, provided next to \textbf{nothing}, nor to address your own points nor to counteract whatever proof I gave you.> 3. If you didn't use the above, you used ad hominem attacks...Insults and "ad hominem" are two different things. "Ad hominem" is when I dismiss your arguments without proving them to be invalid, instead just assuming that they're invalid on the basis of a characteristic you possess. "You're a \textbf{misogynist}, therefore your argument is wrong" is an ad hominem.What I did is to prove that your arguments are fucking wrong and biased and, on top of that, calling you a \textbf{misogynist} for using misogynistic bullshit as arguments. As long as I keep addressing your arguments, insulting you is not an ad hominem.> You base your opinion on the belief that there is a \textbf{patriarchy} that oppresses everyone but "cis" straight white men.No, I base my opinion on the fact that (1) There's a literal metric ton of evidence that such systemic oppression exist, for every single axis of oppression; and that (2) more and more objections towards the theory of oppression get shot down. It's like with evolution. I don't see evolution happening right in this instant, but I can see that the evidence is overwhelmingly leaning towards the "evolution exists" side, so that's why my opinion is that "evolution exists". The same with oppression.Your actions are those of an hyperskeptic - someone that has already decided a priori his own opinion (that there is no oppression) and he'll hold on to it as long as there's a single, infinitesimally chance that your opinion is right. Which is like saying "Well, what if God doesn't do anything and cannot interact or be perceived by us mortals?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@ThEwAcKySiBlInGs \textbf{Sexism} towards women is vocal and dominant and in my experience is based on oppression of men as ipposed to equality.

That was one survey in one college that was only answered by a disproportionately female group 4/5 had been sexually assaulted. The rest of those ask to take the survey did not as they felt it was irrelevant to them which makes the survey completely inaccurate as if they had accounted for those who weren't assaulted and therefore didnt take a survey called "\textbf{Sexual} assault survey" the number is closer to 1/53 in America which is not surprising considering it's America. \textbf{Sexism} towards men is that 48 of domestic abuse is against men with men being physically threatened way more than women and a great example is a video where a male and female actor pretend to be an abusive couple and when the man slaps the \textbf{woman}, the police are called, he's held down and kicked but when the \textbf{woman} slaps the man almost 190 people walk by and some fucking cunt begins cheering.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Dario Carraresi Well actually it's closer to 40-60 male and female victims respectively. Surprisingly, \textbf{sexual} assault amongst \textbf{lesbian} couples is sky-high at nearly 30. Also, men are almost 3 times more likely to commit suicide than women because lack of services or "women only" therapy groups. In fact, suicide is the number 1 killer of men between roughly 15-40 in some countries. I'll leave the links.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Lúcás Ó'Daimhín The first link talks solely about \textbf{lesbian} couples. However, I found this from the study's abstract: "when items were weighted to create an indicator of severity, no significant differences between lesbians and \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} men were found." [LINK] The second link points out that, although men successfully commit suicide more often than women, women attempt suicide more often than men.In the "Prevention" paragraph, they note that one of the possible explanations for that difference is related to the different suicide methods used by men and women. Specifically: there seems to be a correlation between the presence of a gun in the household and death by suicide. Makes sense, as sucide by firearm is a lot more probable to cause death than, say, pill overdose. I also don't buy their explanation that "men are more resolved to die", since there hasn't been found any difference in desire to die between men and women, despite one tending to choose less painful and less "reliable" methods.They do, however, point to social stressors that men face, such as occupational stress (like being fired). I do think that there's massive stigma for men to "show weakness", including going to a therapist to deal with stressfull situations instead of bottling them up.I found this. It's not specifically about male suicide, but it does focus on how the social pressure to "be strong" can be massively damaging to men and boys. [LINK] And lastly, the third link. The exact study isn't cited, but I've already seen that "40" statistic in studies that used the CTS scale - and that instrument isn't good. [LINK] Basically, not only the Conflict Tactics Scale study was flawed (for example: the response rate was way too low to be acceptable), but the scale itself was massively bullshit: not only there is no mention of \textbf{sexual} violence, but it considers all single acts of violence as the same "value" regardless of context (mock-kicks that neither partner finds threatening are judged more severe than being showed against the wall) and result (a shove in self-defense to get your attacker off of you is considered as violent as showing someone down the stairs). So I'll have to take those studies with a grain of salt.Anyway, I'm gonna just leave this link list of resources/books/blogs for male survivors of abuse (USA-centric), in case anyone needs it.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@UndertaleSkeleBros I hear you and appreciate your perspective.I think men and women make different decisions when it comes to work choices.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Feminism excludes men by definition, its about empowering women, not men. If you say you believe in empowering both men and women equally then you are an Equalist, and believe in Equalism, not feminism. That's where the problem is with the feminist movement, they claim to be all for equality but they fail to acknowledge that women also have huge expectations of men that are also unrealistic and emotionally damaging. Just like how she said it's not socially acceptable for a man to be feminine, but you don't see very many women calling feminine men sexy or attractive. However, they expect the reverse to be true and want men to find all body types and personalities attractive, while they also want to see photoshopped guys with huge muscles that wear only underwear so you can see their photoshopped dick bulging out like they have a 16 inch 3rd arm for a penis. Stop ignoring the fact that your \textbf{gender} is not the only one with unfair beauty and behavior standards, and that men are inevitably just as oppressed as women are. This isn't even including things like being the protector, which is why men tend to not live as long as women, being expected to suppress your emotions, being expected to be a "gentleman" which is the \textbf{gender} equivalent to being a "lady", which they hate. The fact that the suicide rate for men in 3 times higher than it is for women could be a good indication to men feeling helpless and put down just as much as women, if not more because the media and the general public have so far refused to bring the up topic of \textbf{sexism} against men as a serious issue in society.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/289 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.038 \\  \hline

Claiming it's being "not like girls" is terribly sexist, since you're saying that girls can't perform and succeed. :PThe thing is, the pressures for a man, are not about whether they're feminine or not, for the most part, they're about failing as a man. You can probably already imagine masculinity-femininity as an axis, but a better way of looking at it is as a two-dimensional plane, where masculinity and femininity are the axes. You can be "low" on masculinity without conversely being "high" in femininity. Of course, even that is an oversimplification, and probably not even the best way to put it. But, you're correct, \textbf{sexism} can hurt everyone. However, it's not all negative, either - if someone is a strong macho man, and you tell them, "you can do X because you're a man", you're being sexist, but they might also enjoy it. \textbf{Sexism} is after all,  discrimination, meaning "making a distinction IN FAVOR or AGAINST."\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/189 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.587 \\  \hline

But that's besides the point. The point is, society has just built a negative stigma towards men in which men have to support their wife and children, men have to pay all the bills to support their house, and most importantly, men have to be masculine and are not allowed to express human emotion, because apparently doing so will only strip them of their masculinity. This is just absolute bullshit and complete lunacy.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Lyanna Stark I think you're wrong in my opinion men are the main victim of \textbf{sexism} as of right nowJust a few examples: 1. Women get custody way more often than men2. When women are beat by men the men are seen as monsters but when a \textbf{woman} beats a man the man is seen as weak and don't say you wouldn't see a man getting beat by a \textbf{woman} as weak because it doesn't matter plenty of men would see him as weak which just as men make fun of men who are "weak" Women make fun of women for being "Sluts" . The majority of slut shaming is done by other women after all.3. Men are pressured by society to be unemotional and strong from a young \textbf{age} but men are not emotionless and bottling up our emotions like this can be damaging causing it to be difficult for some men to have emotional relationships with other human beings but if you see a \textbf{woman} crying she gets so much comfort and support4. Rape, many of you feminists think rape helps your case that "women are the main victims of \textbf{sexism}" but the truth is the majority of rape is seen in prisons and is male on male. Another thing feminists do is they tell you not to normalize the word rape when they themselves are the ones normalizing the word rape by saying things like, touching you in any way because touching a \textbf{woman} is not rape its \textbf{sexual} harassment there is a difference. \textbf{Sexual} Harassment: the making of unwanted \textbf{sexual} advances or obscene remarksRape: Rape is a type of \textbf{sexual} assault usually involving \textbf{sexual} intercourse or other forms of \textbf{sexual} penetration perpetrated against a person without that person's consentRape=penetrative \textbf{sex} anything else is either a form of \textbf{sexual} harassment or assault5. Rape, again. Men get falsely accused of rape all the time and everyone believes the \textbf{woman} accusing them and even if they are proven innocent it's already too late by then everyone hates them for being a rapist and word isn't going to get around about a man being falsely accused of rape.Not only do men get falsely accused of rape but men are often made fun of if they come out about getting raped by a \textbf{woman} not only this but the women who committed the act get a substantial amount less prison time for the same crime.6. Priviledge: Are you going to be one of those people yelling you're a white male so what if you're a white male this in no way means you have privilege and how does being privileged subtract from your opinion just because someone doesn't have the same problems as someone else doesn't mean they cannot sympathize and understand their struggles If you say tl;dr you can go fuck yourself\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Sex, Sexism, Sexual, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}17/481 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.534 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Before I start, I'd just like to let everybody know that this was a great video, and that it was articulate and thoughtful. It can be very difficult to communicate complex ideologies and belief systems in the format of an 8-minute video, and this short clip did a tremendous job with that. Feminism, no matter where you are in the argument, is a very pertinent topic. I have a couple questions though.1) As with any ideology, any labeling will immediately tie participants to the most radical sections of the movement: if you're conservative, you'll be called "bible belt"; if you're socialist, you'll be called a "marxist"; if you're a statist, you'll be called a "\textbf{nazi}" and; if you're a feminism, you'll be called a "\textbf{feminazi}".This is the problem with all ideologies, and why I try not to associate myself with any of them. My first question is, why does radical feminism exist, and is it at all supported by moderate feminism? 2) Feminists often claim that "men's issues" exist as a result of men being over-masculinized, their feelings not being allowed to show. Is it possible that there are any other "men's issues": unfair treatment in divorce cases, higher rape statistics for men etc. etc. which don't result from being perceived as "too feminine" ?  3) Feminists seldom reveal any existence of the matriarchy(s), of which there have always been some. Is it possible that oversimplifying \textbf{sexism} as solely patriarchal could be harmful, or at least intellectually dishonest? 4) I'm sure you can agree that men and women have equal rights in the first world. Even though men can be mistreated in divorce cases, this is a result of judicial bias, which is considered illegal. Legally, men and women have equal rights. Legally, equality exists. There is no institutional \textbf{sexism}, in either direction, in the first world. In this way, aren't cases of \textbf{misogyny} or \textbf{misandry} confined to individual \textbf{sexism}, which can be prevented by simply teaching people to "not be assholes"? 5) When referring to the "\textbf{patriarchy}", wouldn't it make far more sense to simply call it "society"; considering "\textbf{patriarchy}" is such a divisive term as it stands, and rife with connotations of a global, male conspiracy systematically oppressing women, wouldn't it make more sense to simply call it "society" ? These are all very minor points though. \textbf{Gender} roles. \textbf{Gender} roles are everywhere, from the workplace to the kitchen. \textbf{Gender} roles have historically been reinforced by society, politics, and the cultural framework: art, music, literature. As Heraclitus said, "the only constant is change", however there is another constant: \textbf{gender} roles. Every. Single. Sexually-reproducing society has \textbf{gender} roles. Bats have a \textbf{sexual} devision of labour. Cats have a \textbf{sexual} devision of labour. Every manner of avian creatures have a \textbf{sexual} devision of labour. Gingko-biloba Japanese trees have some form of \textbf{sexual} devision of tasks. Literally every single life form on this planet at least DEFINES the sexes by some characteristics. Every single one. If all other life on this planet accepts some form of \textbf{gender} roles, then what gives feminism the authority to remove them? \textbf{Gender} roles are probably the most natural thing on this planet, above and beyond quinoa and kale. If you want to truly be "organic", reinforce \textbf{gender} roles. Why is there a double standard when it comes to nature? Eco-friendly folk look outside at the trees and the birds, like I do, and are amazed by their wonder; yet, faced by the same nature or "Gods work" or whatever name is most fitting, in the form of \textbf{gender} roles, they become angry at the "injustices of society". What gives feminists the right to superimpose their strictly individual view of \textbf{gender} upon nature?

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small 1:00 well it was going good until then. i mean there were a few things which dont fit in with what i see but i mean i cant blame a female for not being entirely accurate on her description of the experience of a \textbf{gender} she is notbut then oops, \textbf{sexism} is usually against women and that is where the problem starts. it seems as though you cant comprehend the fact that society might few some stereotypically masculine traits as negative. it seems like you cant see how they view stereotypically feminine traits as overwhelmingly positive. and how men are encouraged more and more in society to be like women even in places where it is psychologically unhealthy to do so and is damaging to our romantic relationships.yeah some of the pressure is "hey dont be a \textbf{pussy} bro, grow some balls". but the pressure exists for females as well to not be too masculine. people often want others to fit in the gendered boxes. but women are viewed as so inherently good and stuffs that we give them more freedom in that area.please, i implore you, try to get to the truth of the problems faced by men. dont just shove it into your feminist narrative. dont just listen to the guys who buy into the feminist narrative because their view of the oppression they face will be warped by those ideologies. in fact i recommend you taking everything anypony says about the oppression they face (including what i have said) with a grain of salt. focus on the facts in their stories and work to figure out what is going on not just what fits your ideas about \textbf{patriarchy} or whatever.here are the discriminations i, as a man, have faced that i can think of off the top of my head: first of all i am confronted with the discrimination that i must make the first move in a relationship. must ask her out, no option to just make it obvious im interested and wait for her to make the move. that being said i have been asked out but it is simply not as \textbf{common}. secondly i dont have the support system and scholarships available that women do. none of these support systems or scholarships were gendered for me however there are plenty just for women only. my interpretation of this is that women are considered more worth helping and more "oppressed" so we need affirmative action to help them. but we really dont, there are already more females than males in collegesthird the only career which interests me in the slightest is being a stay at home husband or something of the sort. however i struggle with the idea of that because i have been indoctrinated that men arent good enough at that sort of things. and also because i know women are likely to dump any guy like that so... i guess i will try to find some monotonous job i hate so i can be the breadwinner or whatever and actually have a significant other.fourth the more i learn the more terrified i become because of my \textbf{gender}. men are more likely to be the victims of violence. men get raped about as much as women but must fear doing anything about it because they will be thought less of and even hated for being raped. men can get accused of rape and have their lives ruined even when they didnt. men have no reproductive rights, if i accidentally get a girl pregnant she can take my money for the next 18 years and i have no say in that and no hope of seeing the child if she doesnt want me to. if there is a draft as a man i can be called to war, and that is twice as likely as it should be because no women can be called in by the draft. if i do anything violent or vaguely criminal i am likely to be hated or sent to jail for it as opposed to being helped and let off the hook if i were a \textbf{woman}. so i must toe the line, constantly careful,and fifth people like you think only feminine things can be disliked by society and dismiss the reality of the \textbf{sexism} against men as mansplaining and rape apology and just being another shitty MRA\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Common, Gender, Patriarchy, Sexism, Woman, pussy & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General, Nationality - Chinese, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}8/736 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.087 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I hope you understand that male and females have different roles in society for said society to actually function. Encouraging men to be whiny and feminine is a serious down play of masculinity, the fact you have little boys told not to hit girls and protect their sisters en-stills in them a sense of putting priority and security of others before their own, that is why its more men than women that actually die to save another, and now you want them to lose that sense of priority and be more inward thinkers? The only reason this way of thinking is alright for women is because they are a prized commodity for society to exist, one male is sufficient to breed a thousand offspring if there are sufficient interested females, which doesn't work the other way around. The issues you raise don't exist because men tend to be more emotionally self restrained, its because women neglect and downplay the fact that men are ready to die for them by saying that they don't require them and are independent women. There is no such thing as an independent individual, society works because of how integrated we are, every man needs a \textbf{woman} and it's plain idiocy to assume women don't need men.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/211 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.474 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small So Laci's argument essentially boils down to "Men are pressured to be masculine, and masculinity is a bad thing." I may be oversimplifying, but I think that it is sums it up on the most basic level. At any rate, she encourages men to be more feminine, but never asks women to be more masculine. This is why I have a problem with her argument. I don't quite think she realizes that most men say things like "be a man," and behave in masculine ways, because they see masculinity as a GOOD thing. I have rarely ever felt that I was not free to be myself because I needed to "man up." I quite like my masculinity, I have rarely ever seen it as a bad thing, and I think most men share my view. Furthermore, it has been my experience that women in general admire and are attracted to masculine men, so apparently, they don't think masculinity is a bad thing either.

What would happen if a man left his pregnant lover in the wild? Would she be able to hunt, build a shelter, or deliver the baby on her own?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Hello I'm a male and today I would like to share my story of when I got raped, and yes it wasn't by a man it was by an ex-wife. She forced herself onto me and performed \textbf{sexual} acts with me and when I tried to get back up she would begin to punch me in the face. Even though she was I didn't fight back because I'm not that kind of person. After she was done with me she kicked me out of my house and said if I called the cops she would kill me. I shouldn't have believed her but I was too scared at the time to question it. All I had with me when I left was the clothes on my back and my phone I had no money because she had taken my wallet from me. I tried calling friends and family trying to find a place to stay that night but because how late it was \textbf{nobody} picked up, then I tried googling a safe house for abuse but all I found only took in women. I was a mess with blood and tears all over my face I had nowhere else to go until a car stopped next with the guy in the car pulled down his window and asked what was wrong, so I told him my story and he told me to get it the car. After i got in the car he took me into the police station and it turns out he was an off duty officer. So for the next hour or so they calmed me down and written down my story and they went to arrest her. Luckily this story has a happy ending because she is spending 2 years in jail now.

By saying that the male identity is bad, and that men shouldn't behave like men, YOU Laci are in fact the one being sexist.

So tell me how there is a wage gap, when a business owner would never pay more for the same work.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@David Young Again: you haven't even seen what were in those Tumblr posts. Here's what you've dismissed so far:1) A bunch of statistics on women's oppression in the Western World. Some of the sources used: the Inter-Parlamentary Union, the YWCA, the National \textbf{Sexual} Violence Resource Center, NIJ, RAINN, the National Center for Biotechnology Information, the United Nations Development Programme, the Kaiser Family Foundation, HIPS, the Guttmacher Institute, CAADA, YWCA Canada, Stonewall and the Royal Canada Mounted Police. According to you, none of these are evidence.2) A list of male privileges compiled by a guy. All of these are easily verifiable. But you dismissed them all as "not evidence".3) A post that explains that the concept of "first world problems" is bullshit. For example, here's a quote from Nigerian writer Teju Coal: "I don't like this expression "First World problems.' It is false and it is condescending. Yes, Nigerians struggle with floods or infant mortality. But these same Nigerians also deal with mundane and seemingly luxurious hassles. Connectivity issues on your BlackBerry, cost of car repair, how to sync your iPad, what brand of noodles to buy: Third World problems. All the silly stuff of life doesn't disappear just because you're \textbf{black} and live in a poorer country. People in the richer nations need a more robust sense of the lives being lived in the darker nations. Here's a First World problem: the inability to see that others are as fully complex and as keen on technology and pleasure as you are". But according to you, what people of the third world say is "not evidence".4) An experience of someone who explains how "Shut up, women in the third world have it worse" is \textbf{nothing} but silencing. 1st world feminists are told to stop complaining, because at least they aren't in the 3rd world. 3rd world feminists are told to stop complaining, because at least they aren't born in rural areas and forced into marriage when still underage. The maid who was born in a rural area and was forced into marriage while still underage was told to stop complaining because at least she isn't beaten up or disfigured with acid. See the pattern? No, of course you don't. It isn't "evidence", after all.5 through 11) Are all posts about women in science and history, which disproves your assumption that "men invented everything". The last post goes all the way back to the 23rd century BC. All of those women's existance and accomplishments are easily verifiable on Wikipedia. But, according to you, it's not "evidence".And here, have another link: a non-complete list of inventions that were created by non-white people.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I think you need to also realize - that a movement created by women and for women cannot effectively speak for and address the issues faced by young men.  This would require a voice that included them - not one that excluded their issues.  I think it is important to remember that the current ratio in university is nearly 3 to 2 female - and media income for younger people (under 30) is higher for women.  It is also important to remember that most American women - still want their husband to be the primary breadwinner in the family - meaning that he will be under tremendous pressure to make it so.  However, because feminism - is by women for women - they will not be able to effectively understand  - or really absorb this - because it is a problem that is primarily faced by men (hence 93 of work place deaths being male) and this would require actually permitting a male voice and perspective to gain voice within the movement.  While feminism is still required - in the west, another voice also needs to be heard, as the situation for the young - is radically different than the \textbf{old} - those born prior to 1961 have a very different lived experience (those are todays in power people) from those born after 1980.  Also - note your point about rape is really important - so much so that a minor who is male - who is sexually assaulted by a \textbf{woman} of 30 - if it results in a child - he can expect to be required to pay child support upon reaching 18 - in many states.

And since the stay-at-home parent is favored by family courts because it's more beneficial for the kids to stay with the "primary care-giver", that means that mothers get custody more often.

Or why the whole " men being perverts " stereotype even existed? Because for centuries and even now. a lot of men love beautiful women who have boobs and ass and are simply lustful and why there are more men commenting about asses in a twerking video then " I wonder if she has the same hobbies as I do? " or " What does she do for a living? "  . instead men usually say " Dat ass " " damn she thicc " or " Booty clap! " Now it's not all men care about. But it's definitely important to them. But it's unrealistic for a man to just have \textbf{sex} with a \textbf{woman} and then just leave her there. Especially if they were kinda building up their relationship and it led to that point and they liked each other. Obviously the man isn't just gonna leave after he's done. Use your head. A lot of men can be desperate. Especially if there is no make-up to make us look pretty and especially when men have to be the ones to ask girls out since the majority of communities it's the men flirting with the girl first.

Why is femininity encouraged in women? Because it makes it easier for men to be 'superior'.. Quite a big percentage of the problems that men have related to \textbf{sexism}, all stem from the latent belief that femininity is shameful. I as a trans \textbf{woman} know this all too well. Men aren't just told to love their masculinity, they're embraced for it. It's actually quite heavily pushed on them. The problem is not masculinity, the problem is \textbf{sexism}. Exposing these quite well concealed bullshit problems, and challenging them, is essential for a more equal society. One in which looking down on men for their perceived feminine characteristics, isn't a thing. Because We actually recognise femininity as a valid thing that anyone of any \textbf{gender} can possess and not be ridiculed for. Men seen as brutes, unintelligent, or 'frat boys'', are probably just idiots.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Sir Hayler Being masculine isn't the same as raping someone. Maybe cat calls are the product of men trying to be masculine, but that's not the only reason I'm concerned. Men are why less likely to seek help when they're in abusive situation or have been raped and when they do, they often times are not taken seriously. And why? Because they're men and they should be strong, able and masculine enough to help themselves. "Masculine men don't need help, they're active and help themselves. Men who can't are pussys and should be ridiculed." This is an important reason why masculinity is harmful when it's expected. There's \textbf{nothing} wrong with being masculine, but in our culture it's expected of men to be masculine. And that's why it's a problem.And even if none of the problems that often come along with masculinity apply to you, how does that make the whole thing false?

Sexuality is multi faceted and the real change comes from how people perceive things, remember there are also positive aspects of masculinity, chivalry, guardianship, paternity.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Sir Hayler My comment was made with the context of the original comment. Masculinty isn't inherently wrong, but there are parts of it wich need to be fought, just like with femininity. But it's way more acceptable for women to be masculine than for men to be feminine, so it's not that big of a problem. \textbf{Transgender} women (mtf) have a way higher chance than getting murdered than \textbf{transgender} men (ftm). Do you not think this is related to stigmas about men having to be masculine? Girls who wear dresses are allowed in school and so are women in "boys clothing", oants. But boys get expelled for wearing dresses. This, together with other issues, is why masculinity is being talked about, not femininity.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Transgender & \cellcolor{green!27}Sexual Identity - Transexuality & \cellcolor{green!27}2/123 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.626 \\  \hline

[LINK] But please, do continue.> Women receive lower prison sentences.The Starr study explains that the sentencing discrepancy is conditioned by arrest offense (ie. what you were charged with on arrest), criminal history, and whether you take a plea bargain or not. In other words: you're whining that women receive less years of conviction when they (A) commit lighter crimes than men; (B) commit less crimes than men, and thus are less likely to be repeated offenders; and (C) more likely to take a plea bargain that results in minimal jail time, which is further restricted by A and B.I raise with Schazenbach's study on how the demographics of judicial districts influence the sentences of said districts. TL;dr: there is a \textbf{gender} gap that disfavors men, but only due to male judges. The higher the percentage of female judges, the smaller the gap, to the point that a judicial district with 100 female judges is estimated to give harsher sentences to women. [LINK] > Women are more likely to be hired over men in the same position.The Ceci and Williams study has multiple problems. Namely: it only studied one part of the hiring process; and there's the chance that the "hirers" catched on to the fact that they were tested, and thus gave "politically correect" answers, instead of what they would've actually done. [LINK] I raise with these two studies. In the first, the candidates were required to run a test in roder to gauge their efficiency (both men and women resulted roughly equal); then, the "employers" were required to choose between a man and a \textbf{woman}, having no information beside their appearance. Results: 2 men picked for every \textbf{woman}. The vas majority of "mistakes" (picking the less efficient candidate) were of the "man picked over more capable \textbf{woman}" kind. Another group of "employers" was instead allowed to know the candidates' scores; the bias was reduced, but not fully eliminated (3:2 ratio). [LINK] The second one was instead done by Yale University. Various resumes were sent to various STEM faculties. Here's the catch: all resumes sent to a specific faculty were word-by-word identical except for the candidate's name. Not only were women much less likely to be called back, they were offered much less money. We're talking about 4.000\$ per year less.

In fact, people in general can care about multiple things at once. Random example: [LINK] Second: there ARE feminists in the "third world countries" that are dealing with those problems, which directly leads us to point three: going into other countries to be the white saviour? Bad idea. This approach has literally NEVER worked. It's the people who are there that know best how to deal with the problems of there.Fourth: "first world problems" is a meaningless concept. "Third world" women care about street harassment, the internet, fashion, representation in video games in their own home country. "First world" women care about rape, domestic violence, droughts in their own home country.

And yet they haven't magically gone away because there's a law written on a piece of paper.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Sexual, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/312 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.962 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Sir HaylerLet's see what O'Neilly, aka The Spectator's writer says...1) He says that women and \textbf{black} people are more likely to attend higher levels of education than men and white people, respectively. Are men/white people being prevented from entering those colleges? No; the vast majority of scholarships go to white people. [LINK] And there's evident proof of discrimination in favor of men. [LINK] Does the fact that "more women go to college than men" disprove the fact that women are discriminated when it comes to being hired/promoted? No. But here's an interesting fact: women need a PhD to make as much in their life as a man with a bachelor's degree. That may be an explanation for the \textbf{gender} discrepancy in college attendance - because men don't have to go to college, if they want a high salary. Women don't have the same luck.2) Second point: white men are "derided" in a test. Oh, you poor, poor thing. Whatever shall we do. This is much worse than being constantly harassed on the streets, of being discriminated at your job, or being raped/killed by the police... wait...Not to mention: the survey doesn't divide the respondents by \textbf{race}, but it DOES divide them by \textbf{gender}. Here's the average scores that were given to "white men in his 20s":By everyone: 8By men: 6By women: 123) "Young women now earn more than young men". This article again. Here's the FIRST line: "Women in their 20s have reversed the \textbf{gender} pay gap, but their earning power is still overtaken by men later in life."What do they mean by "overtaken"? Well, if we only consider a man and a \textbf{woman} doing the exact same job for the exact same amount of time and with the exact same efficiency, and if we exclude things like hiring and promoting biases, the motherhood penalty, and the fact that women who aggressively negotiate their own salaries are more likely to get less money - or to not get hired at all - than if they just accepted what was offered them (while men who aggressively negotiate their own salaries in the exact same way obtain higher salaries than the men who don't), there'd STILL be a 7 difference. And that's for white women, mind you. [LINK] 4) Then there's this paragraph: "Partly this is just bad science: feminists, leftists and others see that parliament and the boardroom still have a hefty number of white men in them and they extrapolate from this to argue that all white men must have lovely lives. Hence they always use the ridiculously sweeping terms ‘white men' or ‘male privilege', as if whiteness and maleness were inherently beneficial. As if loads of white men aren't dirt poor and awfully underprivileged." Which reveals how little does O'Neill understand the concept of "white privilege"."White privilege" means that white people get specific advantages that non-white people do not have. That does NOT mean "all white people have good lives"; it means that white people have it better than non-white people, that white men have it better than non-white men, that white women have it better than non-white women, that rich white people have it better than rich non-white people, that poor white people have it better than poor non-white people, that hetero white people have it better than hetero non-white men, that \textbf{L\textbf{G\textbf{BT}}}+ white people have it better than \textbf{L\textbf{G\textbf{BT}}}+ non-white people...Another concept is "intersectionality": privilege and oppression intersect with each other. For example: \textbf{black} people are at a much higher risk of police misconduct than white people; women are at a much higher risk of \textbf{sexual} assault than men. Thus, for example, a \textbf{black} man may be privileged in some ways (he isn't nearly as much at risk of being victim of \textbf{sexual} assault as \textbf{black} women) and oppressed in others (he is at a much higher risk of being victim of police misconduct than white men). See how that works? And this also counts for \textbf{classism}, despite what O'Neilly claims.5) Lastly, the "privileged tears" meme ("white tears", "male tears" etc.) does NOT refer to physical or emotional pain, nor does it refer to people's reaction to any social problem they face. It refers to the whining of privileged people for things that they perceive as social problems, but aren't social problems at all.For example: "Women want to ruin videogames" is not a social problem, because that phrase is simply false. Women want representation in videogames; they want them to be less cliched in their repeated use of women as eye candy with \textbf{zero} impact to the story, or as victim whose sole contribution to the story is to be harmed/killed by the bad guy. They want videogames to be better. So, when guys whine that "Women want to ruin videogames", what they're really whining about is that they don't get to be overrepresented anymore. So, "male tears".\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Classism, Gender, LGBT, Race, Sexual, Woman, Zero & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General, Sexual Identity - General, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality, Sexual Identity - Transexuality, Social Class - General & \cellcolor{green!27}19/824 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.306 \\  \hline

In any case I'm hardly represented in video games either. Video games are entertainment and they're also made for a demographic, they'll keep doing what they're doing because it's popular. Not to mention that these video games are a tiny subsector known as AAA games, there are plenty of other games that don't have the same tropes that appeal to women. Guess what?

Or why a job's prestige changes depending on how the \textbf{gender} balance shifts (for example, the more men enter in nursing, the more the wages rise - and a \textbf{gender} gap forms in favor of men, one that cannot be explained by differences in efficiency).2)"Does the fact that "more women go to college than men" disprove the fact that women are discriminated when it comes to being hired/promoted?"> I've already shown you that women are 2:1 and sometimes even 4:1 more likely to be hired for STEM positions so now you are just lying.And I've already shown you three more reliable tests that directly show you how women are less likely to be hired (up to half as likely), more likely to be offered less money than a man with the exact same copy-pasted qualifications, and how women who negotiate their salaries have, on average, lower salaries than the women who don't, while the men who negotiate their own salaries in the same way as those women have a HIGHER salary than the men who don't.> 3)I've already shown that the gap is a mere 7 according to the AUUW...First: "mere" my fucking ass. Apply that over a fucking lifetime, see if that's "mere". Second: that's 7 after excluding all of these from the equation:- "Female" jobs having loweer salaries and prestige than "male" ones, in the sense that, if a job (ex: teaching) starts being filled with women the wages go DOWN for no apparent reason other than \textbf{sexism}. [LINK] - The reverse is also true: if a job gets progressively filled with men (ex: computer programming), the wages and prestige raise. Again: no possible reason other than \textbf{sexism}. (Yes, they've already checked for differences in efficiency. Still didn't explain the variation.) [LINK] - Social pressures that push women away from "male" jobs, because "That's a job for men". Thus: women are pushed away from higher-pay jobs.- Hiring biases. Which means longer periods of unemployment. Which means less lifetime earnings.- Promoting biases. Which means less lifetimes earnings.- Harassment against women in "male" jobfields. Which pushes women out of those high-pay workfields.- Women being pressured to be the stay-at-home parent. Which means being unable to have a full-time high-pay career.- "Motherhood penalty", which means that employers are less likely to give promotions to a family-age \textbf{woman} because "She'll go take care of the children soon, right?", unless she specifically and repeatedly displays otherwise.- Women being treated as "selfish" if they do pursue their careers instead of being the stay-at-home parent.And third: that's a 77 gap for white women. What's your explanation for \textbf{black} or latina women?> ...everything else you speak of comes down to personal choice not discrimination...See the above.> ...motherhood is a choice, maternity benefits far outweigh paternity benefits anyway.Citation needed, plus it doesn't explain all of the above.> You speak about negotiations as well, \textbf{woman} are far less likely to negotiate due to a more passive temperament, this isn't sexist it's an evolutionary trait.No, they don't negotiate because when a \textbf{woman} negotiates, the likely result is either less pay or not being hired at all. While when a man negotiates IN THE EXACT SAME WAY AS THAT \textbf{WOMAN} the likely result is a higher pay. Got that? Same actions, different \textbf{gender}, different result.

[LINK] > 4)"\textbf{Black} people are at a much higher risk of police misconduct than white people" Did you consider that might be because criminality is more prevalent in \textbf{black} society?Prove it.

And to preventively cut down your objections:1) Women are roughly half of gamers. So you can't say "It's because there's a lot more male gamers than female ones".2) You can't say "It's because those kind of games wouldn't sell" without proving it, aka you must bring out a game that has (A) gameplay equivalent to a game X with "fanservice for men", (B) marketing equivalent to that same game X, and (C) sales sizably less than those of game X.> should I throw a hissy fit because I don't feel represented in an inordinate amount of female focused media?Dude.

I never said they were discriminatory your assumption proves my point, that any discrepancies aren't looked at with logic applied but your conclusion is always that discrepancies equate to discrimination, I could argue that anyway due to male success rate since education was overhauled from o-levels that boys pass rates have become worse and there has been a massive \textbf{gender} role reversal in teaching staff, there are a lack of male role models for young boys in the education system.

It's not like it's there whole basis for existing and it's data isn't to be greatly skewed in it's own favour?3)Wtf are you talking about? You misunderstand what the 7 means obviously... it's 7 of the ENTIRE population of women, if you break it down into individual monetary value per person it's cents, literal cents. You clearly have no grasp of economics. And the guardian article you linked me has the exact same economic trappings, women are working less again, "The two measures differ because the ONS compares median hourly earnings – rather than annual earnings – and excludes overtime. It does this because overtime can skew results, given that men work relatively more overtime than women. Using hourly earnings better accounts for the fact that men work on average more hours than women, in the ONS view) why can't you grasp that if you work less hours you earn less pay...  you keep going on about how women are punished for having children but I will respond the same, having children ISN'T mandatory, if you chose to have children you have to except the financial consequences ffs, in fact if you don't earn enough you get child tax credits anyway to compensate. 4)Do you really need a citation to show that fathers don't get the same paid leave as mothers? Come on dude.  [LINK]  52 weeks for women, For men "You may not get both leave and pay, and there are rules on how to claim and when your leave can start." and 1 or 2 weeks paid Paternity Leave. I would have thought that was obvious anyway...5) "Not to mention that (A) the police repeatedly over-inspects \textbf{black} people and is much more likely to arrest on flimsy charges, while white people are much more likely to get a pass.And (B), we're talking about police Misconduct? As in "They killed those people without any legitimate reason"?"Sigh, it's exactly for the same reasons I've already said, ALL police tend to be more sceptical with \textbf{black} suspects because unfortunately crime rates are so high within the \textbf{black} community, yes it's an unfortunate side effect of high \textbf{black} crime rates, and my point remains the same for B, more \textbf{black} crime equals more occurrence for police misconduct, come on think about it, if 8/10 times the perpetrator is \textbf{black} then the majority of misconduct is going to happen to the most prevalent criminal type, including innocent people for the reason I stated first, that because of a higher amount of \textbf{black} crime a higher amount of mistakes are going to correlate with it."You know \textbf{black} people kill more other \textbf{black} people than white people do, are they \textbf{racist} towards themselves?" It was hyperbole, but you're wrong in your retort anyway, no the same doesn't kill the same most frequently.

If anything video games are more progressive than ever before with the advent of the indie genre, and the untapped market that you speak of? Yeah there are games to appeal to those too that are AAA, Mass Effect, Life is Strange, The Last of Us etc... And I don't need to prove they're popular they make millions... and game studios know their target audience they invest millions into market research... again that's obvious... and media is not all male driven, do you think twilight and fifty shades of grey were tapping into the male market do you?

And by "missed", I mean "already seen a million times, already debunked a million times". Let's see...- NOW didn't oppose fathers having equal custodial rights. It opposed 50/50 custody being the default instead of favoring the primary caregiver. The hell is a "primary caregiver"? It's the parent (father or mother or whatever) who spends the most time with the children. Why is the PG favored in custodial rights? Because that's what's most beneficial for the kid - being able to stay with the parent who knows their needs, what with being the parent who spends most of their times with them. Are feminists preventing fathers from being the PG? No - in fact, since they're against the imposition of traditional \textbf{gender} roles that put the mother in the "stay at home and take care of the children" role, they're all for fathers being the "stay at home" parent if that's what they want.- Yes, a father who gets accused of being an abuser doesn't get less likely to get custody. Know what does reduce your chances at custodial rights? Being a mother who is abused and accuses her abuser. [LINK]  [LINK]  [LINK] - Funny that the only ones reporting this are all anti-feminist sites. Funny how there's absolutely \textbf{nothing} on NOW's side talking about this.- Yes, I'm all for opposing so-called "fathers' rights" who use lies such as "many women lie about being abused/raped" in order to destroy women's chances at escaping their abusers without having to leave their children behind. [LINK] - Feminists didn't "divert" anything. They simply asked for "female" jobs to be helped too.- Note that some feminists campaigned so that the ad campaign included acknowledgment of domestic violence that wasn't solely male-on-female. Note that Glenn Sacks \& co didn't campaign to make female-on-male DV acknowledged - they campaigned for the awareness campaign to be removed.

Or did you just assume, like anti-feminists just assume that women are stupid idiots who are incapable of doing anything important in our society AND controlling every position of power in our society and censoring any dissenting opinion?- Oh, no. Feminists believe rape victims. Whatever shall we do. I mean, it's not like false rape accusations are actually less \textbf{common} than the average false accusation. It's not like there's massive biases against rape victims despite the previous. It's not like the system is so stacked against rape victims, video evidence isn't enough to cause a conviction. It's not like, because of that, rape victims don't even bother to report their own rapes, since they'll almost certainly lead to \textbf{nothing} other than reopening their trauma and being vilyfied for "lying". Oh, wait. [LINK]  [LINK]  [LINK] Also: funny how feminists aren't allowed to believe that those accused of rape are guilty, but MRAs can istantly assume that rape accusers are liars even after a conviction.- Cathy Young has an history of being a rape apologist and victim-blamer. (Note: if you try to claim "Well, you can't expect men to control themselves when they're before a drunken \textbf{woman}", I ask you: if men have as much control as rabid animals, would you have any problem if women treated men as such?) [LINK] - See the above for false rape allegations. 2-8 of rapes reported to the police are "false" (there wasn't a crime, the victim knew this but accused an innocent anyway) or "unfounded" (there isn't enough proof to say that a rape happened); but only 35 of rapes are reported. Using Lisak's "6 of reported rapes are false", we get: (6/100) X (35/100) = 210/10.000 = 2,1Also: Kanin's study was massively flawed, while the US Army one just considered every case where the accuser recanted as a "false accusation", despite the fact that (A) they stopped investigating those claims, therefore they didn't determine that \textbf{nothing} happened; and (B), again, disbelieving rape victims causes them to recant their accusations. Why bother, if the system that's supposed to investigate isn't doing its job? [LINK] - Feminists killed the "don't divulge the names of alleged rapists" law because, as they pointed out, the same law didn't extend the same courtesy to murderers, terrorists, and child abusers. Funny, because while \textbf{nobody} blames victims of murder, terrorism or child abuse, or accuses them of lying for attention, this stuff DOES happen to rape victims. [LINK] - Explain how feminists are stopping men from attending university. Come on, I can wait. Meanwhile, allow me to point up to a different explanation: they don't have to attend higher education. A man with a bachelor degree earns as much as a \textbf{woman} with a Ph.D. [LINK] - Also, about suicide: feminists aren't causing men and boys to commit suicide, nor are they trying to shut down suicide helplines.- The studies that "prove" that men and women commit the same amount of DV are based on the Conflict Tactics Scale. Is it valid? Would you consider valid a scale that equates pushing someone in self-defense with pushing someone down the stairs as equally violent actions? [LINK] - Yeah, no. Prove that feminist censor studies about female-on-male DV. Just saying that they do isn't proof.- Pizzey was attacked because she (wrongly) stated that most DV victims were as abusive as their abusers. Also: no proof that it was feminists who killed her dog (evidence points to \textbf{racist} neighbours).- I've already talked about the SCUM manifesto. Which stayed a manifesto, by the way - there was no SCUM group. Feminists' opinion of SCUM at the time was divided between "What the hell, Solanas?!" and "This is satire."; feminists' opinion of SCUM today is divided between "What the hell, Solanas?!" and "Who the hell is Solanas?".- Feminists don't have a problem with talking about men's issues. They have big problems with (A) people wanting to talk about men's issues every single time feminists want to talk about women's issues, when the reverse - feminists barging in discussions on men's issues to talk about women's issues - doesn't happen; and (B) people taking about "men's issues" that aren't legitimate issues at all, such as "I want to decide whether my girlfriend gets an abortion or not" or "I want to grope/harass/catcall women all I want" or "Men don't get child custody".- As for the "list of hateful feminist quotes", I see it all the time and it's usually bullshit. Check if they are already addressed here and call me back for the ones that aren't. [LINK]  [LINK] >2) [...] Again I'm not talking about movements but social ideologies, those groups are scum but others who are interested in men's rights are interested in things such as court biases or parental issues and have legitimate concerns that aren't radicalised. And those aren't the groups feminists have problems with.> 3)You really need to understand the difference between ideologies and social movements, I'm talking about a way of thinking not activism it's really important that you understand the difference, why don't you show me some examples of what feminism has achieved for men's rights if it's truly about equal rights. In regards to damage done by feminism why don't you read this by a former feminist.Abridged version: "Feminists deny fathers child custody (false), they don't want children (not a problem), they aren't needed in the West (false - see below)". [LINK] > 4)I'm not disagreeing with you but there's a discernible difference between standing up for yourself to achieve social parity and overreaching into fascism, that's the issue that concerns me with social justice including third wavers, it wants to set a precedence that benefits specific groups because of who they are but this is exactly the opposite of progress and is anti equality.Oh my fucking Great A'Tuin, I haven't even opened those links and I already know they're SO MUCH garbage. [LINK] The first one sees NOW's statement that "50/50 custody shouldn't be the default because it's better for the child to be with their primary care-givers" and interprets it as "Feminists oppose men getting child custody". We already went through this.Also, Bloomfield then gets pissed because women now want to concentrate on their careers and don't want to stay at home and take care of the kids, which is the thing that makes you the primary caregiver and thus the parent who's most likely to get child custody. Basically, MRAs want women to stay at home and take care of the kids, and then gets pissed when family courts decide to do what's most beneficial for the kids and allow them to stay with the parent who took care of them the most - which, going by MRA logic, should always be the mother. Un-fucking-believable.Next - oh, fuck, robots.txt. It means that I have to give AVfM a visit. ...Wait, coming to think of it, didn't you just dismiss Paul Elam and "JudgyBitch" as radical extremists? When the latter is an prominent writer of AVfM and the former is its frikkin' founder?!Anyway, this is a long, completely unsourced spiel about how \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} men took the burnt of \textbf{homophobia}, not lesbians, and about how Stonewall was really \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} men coming to the defense of a \textbf{lesbian} \textbf{woman} because white knight. No, really. Oh, and also all feminists (four tweets, of which we don't even know if they're all from feminists) hate \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} men.Hmm, I wonder if Esmay realizes that AVfM is openly \textbf{homophobic}... [LINK] Finally, Mancunion. [LINK] So, basically Baldwin-Pask has a problem with feminists pointing out that men are celebrated every day of the year. YES, that's the case. Do you know how many women who contributed to science or art aren't widely known, unblike many men? They're a lot. But basically, Baldwin is throwing a tantrum because, for once, men aren't in the spotlight. White men, I add - there's the exact same problem with non-white inventors and artists.Also, he's jabbing at Watson. Dude, Emma Watson made the absolutely most polite and demure speech she could ever make, and she was harassed anyway. Because it's not that she isn't polite - it's because she talks about women.Then he talks about that shirt. The problem with that shirt is that (1) it objectifies women, treating them as decorations; (2) Taylor thought it was a good idea to wear it at work; (3) he thought it was a good idea to wear it at a TV conference where he was supposed to represent his department; (4) he wore it and all of his colleagues told him to change it, either because they thought it wasn't problematic or because they thought they would be dismissed as "fun-haters". End result: a message that says "I'm a man in science who can wear a shirt with pin-ups at an important conference and \textbf{nobody} says a thing. You want to get in science too, \textbf{woman}? Get used to be considered more for your looks that for your scientific contributions. Oh, and don't try pulling off the same stunt - when you do that, it's unbelievably professional". And the final nail in this coffin? He acknowledged that he made a mistake wearing that shirt. Why can't you?One last thing: when feminists will literally organize concentration camps or sympatize with Nazis, then it's appropriate to call them "nazis".\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Common, Gay, Gender, Homophobia, Homophobic, Lesbian, Nobody, Nothing, Racist, Red, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - General, Ethnicity - Native-American, Gender - General, Sexual Identity - Female homosexuality, Sexual Identity - General, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}24/2054 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.168 \\  \hline

Let's see...If I and a large percentage of people are automatically turned off by feminism despite identifying as pro equality then how is feminisms image problem not a fact? It's really that simple."According to the survey, just 20 percent of Americans — including 23 percent of women and 16 percent of men — consider themselves feminists. Another 8 percent consider themselves anti-feminists, while 63 percent said they are neither." [LINK] You seem to be under the impression I am anti women's rights, which couldn't be further from the truth but when I see something like news stations promoting the fight against air conditioning in the work place being too cold calling it an act of \textbf{sexism} I can't help but think A) Really? Is this a problem that requires media coverage and B) Women are afforded far more variety in the way they can dress in an office environment then men, if men get too hot in the office they can't stick on a tank top but a \textbf{woman} can wear a sleeveless blouse no problem, so for me it's an example of a non issue and a failure of \textbf{common} sense. Then I see tumblr posts calling all men rapists, or I see double standards of outrage towards to depiction of women in media but non towards men e.g hot men used for diet coke or stupid male characters, it seriously ostracises me. Privilege is another thing that gets on my nerves, I'm poor, white and \textbf{disabled} yet apparently society favours me because I'm male, I'm liable to rape at any time because I have a penis and no sense of decency, perhaps I'm quick to make generalisations of feminism but it's equally quick to do the same of me, you see to me if decent feminists started to call themselves egalitarian it would do a lot to mend negative assumptions of feminist issues, would feel more incisive and would weed out misandrists. Another reason I dislike the social justice movement is it's anti free speech, you just have to look at the behaviour on American campuses towards conservative speakers or the promulgation of safe spaces and trigger warnings, the perfect way to discourage the exchange of different view points and coddle developing minds. At least if we disagree with each other I respect the fact that we're even able to have a discussion without the trigglypuff  style discourse being normalised in universities or SJW internet culture. [LINK] >One last thing: when feminists will literally organize concentration camps or sympathize with Nazis, then it's appropriate to call them "nazis"   When people use that analogy it's because they can see similarities between aspects of the fem movement and the \textbf{Nazi} party, like it or not.How the Nazis Used Propaganda to Rally SupportA decade after losing World War I, the German people were demoralized. Then along came the Nazis who inspired them by preying on their emotions.Pride: The Germans had just gotten their asses kicked in the war and they felt like losers. Then along came the Nazis who told them not only weren't they losers, but they were the Master \textbf{Race}. The Nazis made Germans feel proud of being Aryans. Pride is very motivational.Anger: The victors of World War I insisted the Germans repay them for financial losses and forced the Germans to take on crippling debts that crushed their economy. Hyperinflation took hold and every German endured extreme poverty. Then along came the Nazis who told them they were being immorally oppressed. The Nazis made Germans feel angry at their oppressors. Anger is very motivational.Fear: The Nazis inspired fear in the German people from every angle. In the west, the French were trying to undermine them financially. In the east, the Russians were trying to subvert them with communism. In their own country, Jews were trying to pollute their Aryan purity. The Nazis made the Germans afraid. Fear is very motivational.How the Feminists Used Propaganda to Rally SupportAfter three centuries of doing the Three Cursed C's (Cooking, Cleaning and Childcare) American women wanted more. Then along came Feminists who inspired them by preying on their emotions.Pride: Women were playing \textbf{dumb} to make men feel smarter and feigning weakness to make men feel stronger. Then along came the Feminists who told them not only weren't they \textbf{dumb} and weak, but they were smart and strong. The Feminists made women feel proud of being women. Pride is very motivational.Anger: The victors of the world they lived in though were men. They had all the power and enjoyed all the fun. While women stayed home doing the Three Cursed C's, men were having careers and getting laid with young floozies. Then along came the Feminists who told them \textbf{misogyny} was rampant and females were oppressed from birth. The Feminists made women feel angry at their oppressors. Anger is very motivational.Fear: The Feminists inspired fear in women from every angle. To the right were oppressors who would crush their aspirations. To the left were rapists who stalked them like prey. Inside their own homes were abusers who would beat them to a pulp. The Feminists made women afraid. Fear is very motivational.How the Nazis Used Propaganda to Suppress the OppositionIt wasn't enough for the Nazis to simply manipulate people into following them. It was equally important to crush all dissent.Demonizing the Opposition: Anyone who spoke out against the Nazis was immediately slandered. They were called Jew lovers and communists and homosexuals. People quickly learned speaking out against Nazism would ruin their lives and refrained from doing so.Controlling the Message: Failure to support the \textbf{Nazi} movement was equated with supporting the enemies of Germany. If you were pro-Germany then you must be pro-\textbf{Nazi}. If you were anti-\textbf{Nazi} then you must be anti-Germany.

Which means that my point that men aren't worth following is completely valid. See how you sound?> If I and a large percentage of people are automatically turned off by feminism despite identifying as pro equality then how is feminisms image problem not a fact?If by "image problem" you mean "A lot of people believe a lot of bullshit that anti-feminists have said about feminists", then yes, feminism does have an "image problem". But I fail to see how it's feminism's fault.And yes, it IS bullshit. I've literally lost count of so much bullshit, lies and unfounded accusations there was on that list. And many of the "\textbf{common} criticism" against feminists? "Feminists are ugly", "Feminists became feminists because they couldn't get a man", "Feminists hate men and want to beat them"?

[LINK] Second, let me get this straight. Women merely pointing out that they chill during summer because they have to wear miniskirts and bluses at work with the air conditioning set to full blast is "feminism going too far" and you feel threatened by it?> Then I see tumblr posts calling all men rapists...Let me guess, this is about Schrodinger's Rapist, isn't it?> or I see double standards of outrage towards to depiction of women in media but non towards men e.g hot men used for diet coke or stupid male characters, it seriously ostracises me.First: feminists aren't against men or women being used as eye candy. They're against having the vast majority of women's depictions as solely eye candy.Second: there's a difference between a power fantasy and a \textbf{sexual} fantasy. You're supposed to want to be James Bond; you're supposed to want to fuck the Bond Girl.> Privilege is another thing that gets on my nerves, I'm poor, white and \textbf{disabled} yet apparently society favours me because I'm male...Yeah, you don't get how "privilege" or "intersectionality" work. Here's the thing: there's multiple kinds of oppression. The rich hold up the vast majority of the positions of power (political, economical, mediatic, religious etc.), and they use that power to keep the oppressed - in this case the poor - down. The rich also have privilege, which isn't solely "I can do things that poor people can't for no reason other than the fact that I'm rich and therefore can get away with it, thanks to the system that backs me up", but also "I am exempt from the bad stuff that plagues poor people (bad stuff often caused by rich people, like refusing to pay them enough to live), for no reason other than the fact that I'm rich and therefore can get away with it, thanks to the system that backs me up". The same goes for the other kinds of oppression: white people have privilege over \textbf{black} people, men have privilege over women, abled people have privilege over \textbf{disabled} people".Now, all of these privileges and oppressions can intersect with each other, so that you can be privileged in one sense and be oppressed in another. For example: as a white person, you're far less likely to be stopped by the police. \textbf{Black} people don't have that luxury; therefore, what you have is privilege. As a \textbf{disabled} person, however, if you try to ask your teacher/employer for accomodations in order to make your job less difficult, you're seen as someone who wants special rights, while an abled person's request wouldn't be dismissed out of hand like that; therefore, what they have is privilege, and what you have is oppression.> ...I'm liable to rape at any time because I have a penis and no sense of decency...I had to re-read this a few times to actually get what you're saying, but at least now I'm certain that you're talking about Schrodinger's Rapist. Here's the digested version:1) There's a minority of men (and women, but more men) who are rapists.2) Rapists are, as said, a minority. But they rape. A lot.3) Our society holds a lot of wrong assumptions about sexuality and rape. For example: believing that men groping women who don't want to be groped is "natural sexuality" and "men do that"; or believing that a man who's got an erection is willing to have \textbf{sex}.4) There's also a lot of victim-blaming thrown in the mix. People overconcentrate on what the victim (usually female) should have done, and thus pass on the message that "if you're raped, it's because you haven't done what was right to not get raped".5) End result of 1-4: rapists rape, the victims are disbelieved or don't come forward for fear of being disbelieved, rapists are free to rape again and again and again.6) Not only is rape a big, tangible threat, but rapists are capable of acting "normal" or even charming; as such, it's impossible to know who's a rapist and who isn't until they try to rape you.7) Combining 4-6, women are at a sizable risk of being raped (5) - and if they are, they're almost certainly going to be blamed for it if they didn't "protect themselves" enough (3+4). So, they try to "protect themselves" as they have been told (4)... by distrusting men. All men who display \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} flags, since you can't know who's a rapist and who isn't until they start acting "potentially rapey" (6).> ...you see to me if decent feminists started to call themselves egalitarian it would do a lot to mend negative assumptions of feminist issues...They call themselves "feminists" because they concentrate on solving women's oppression. Also, we aren't making a giant, unique movement for ALL the issues because it's ineffective: if we try to treat all the issues as the same time, we end up dispersing our energies. It's much better to have multiple movements each focused on a specific kind of oppression (for example: \textbf{ableism}), led by the people who have dealt with that kind of oppression and who decide by themselves how to act.> Another reason I dislike the social justice movement is it's anti free speech, you just have to look at the behaviour on American campuses towards conservative speakers or the promulgation of safe spaces and trigger warnings...Safe spaces for, say, \textbf{disabled} people don't stop you from saying, say, ableist bullshit (like "the mentally ill are violent criminals"); they do stop you from saying that stuff in those spaces.> the perfect way to discourage the exchange of different view points and coddle developing minds.As for trigger warnings, they don't stop you from saying triggering stuff. They simply make you put a warning beforehand, like the ESRB rating on movies. Because here's the thing: someone with a trigger is the person who knows best how their trigger work. If they decide to not go to a potentially triggering debate, it's because they know they won't be able to handle it and thus make the decision that's best for their own well-being. Likewise, if they decide to go to a potentially triggering debate, not only does that mean that they made that decision because they know that they can handle it, but they'll also get mentally prepared to deal with an eventual trigger, thus greatly reducing the chances of a panic response. Whereas throwing a trigger to someone with \textbf{zero} warning? Bad idea. Most likely scenario: that person will get a panic attack, see you as someone who's completely unwilling to do anything for their own well-being, and refuse to have anything to do with you.> >One last thing: when feminists will literally organize concentration camps or sympathize with Nazis, then it's appropriate to call them "nazis"When people use that analogy it's because they can see similarities between aspects of the fem movement and the \textbf{Nazi} party, like it or not.I repeat: when feminists will literally organize concentration camps or sympathize with Nazis, then it's appropriate to call them "nazis".> After three centuries of doing the Three Cursed C's (Cooking, Cleaning and Childcare) American women wanted more."Three centuries", more like "three millennia", at least.> Pride: Women were playing \textbf{dumb} to make men feel smarter and feigning weakness to make men feel stronger.This is massively bullshit. Women were regarded as weaker and dumber than men; they were refused access to the vast majority of jobs for this very reason. Hell, even today we see women being harassed in sewer work, in engineering, in construction, in firefighting, in the Army, by men who don't want women there because "It's a MAN's job". Usually, they're the same men who then whine that men have to do the most dangerous jobs - jobs they refused to allow women in.> Anger: The victors of the world they lived in though were men. They had all the power and enjoyed all the fun. While women stayed home doing the Three Cursed C's, men were having careers and getting laid with young floozies. Then along came the Feminists who told them \textbf{misogyny} was rampant and females were oppressed from birth.Yes, this IS true. Men did hold the almost totality of political, economic, mediatic and religious power. They still do. So do rich people. So do white people. So do cis people. So do abled people.Social movements have a term of this: kyriarchy, an entire system built on multiple-axis oppressions and dominances that places a very tiny group in a position of power. And anger is justified in hating that system. Not in the "kill them all" sense, but in the "This system is bullshit" sense.> Fear: The Feminists inspired fear in women from every angle. To the right were oppressors who would crush their aspirations. To the left were rapists who stalked them like prey. Inside their own homes were abusers who would beat them to a pulp. The Feminists made women afraid. Fear is very motivational.Except that (A) the Nazis made up those treats, while oppression, rapists and abusers were, and still are, massive problems. Second, I have to remind you that, about rapists specifically, the same society both shames women for distrusting men, and shames them for being raped because they didn't distrust those rapists.> Demonizing the Opposition: Anyone who spoke out against the Feminists was immediately slandered.Prove that feminists slander the opposition. And remember: slander, as in "accusing your opponents of things that they didn't do". Because there's ample proof that those who associate with the "MRA" label (not "those who work to solve men's issues", "those who associate with the "MRA" label") are a bunch of misogynistic fucknuts.> People quickly learned speaking out against Nazism/Feminism would ruin their lives and refrained from doing so.I don't know if I'm invoking Godwin, considering that you are the ones who compared your opponents to the Nazis, but... isn't that similar to what AVfM and company did? Remember RegisterHer?> Controlling the Message: Failure to support the Feminist movement was equated with supporting the enemies of women.Prove that feminists do that. Keep in mind: showing that you are actually a \textbf{misogynist} isn't "treating a failure to support Feminism as proof that you're supporting misogynists", it's "treating supporting misogynists as proof that you're supporting misogynists".Also, in case you've missed that, feminists in general speac against toxic subsets of radical feminists all the fucking time.

Pointing out that when a boy has a tendency to command, he's a "little leader", but when a girl does the exact same thing she's "bossy". Whatever shall we do.> The Wage Gap and "Rape Culture." A half truth and a blatant lie that retards such as yourself honestly still believe. Which isn't even funny to me, it's sad. It truly is because you seem like you're intelligent enough to understand they're not true.Except that they're both true. I'm going to address \textbf{common} "complaints" about them both even if you haven't specifically said what your complaints are, since what you actually said is that both the wage gap and rape culture don't exist because you said so.Wage gap: It's only a 21 gap (2016) if you consider the average pay of all women workers with the average pay of all men workers. If you consider a man and a \textbf{woman} doing the exact same job, for the exact same amount of hours and with the exact same efficiency, the wage gap disappears.First problem with that reasoning: its conclusion is false. Even when we take in account all the differences in jobs, hours worked and efficiency, there's STILL a 7 difference that cannot be explained that way.Second: have you asked yourself why women choose different jobs (that pay less than "male" jobs), why they work for less hours, and why they don't get as much promotions than men? Some explanations:> The social education and pressure (for example: shaming a boy who wants to be a nurse by telling him "That's a GIRLY job!") that pushes boys and girls into different carrer paths;> Jobs who are filled with women being considered "easy" and thus less prestigious and less paid;> Women being seen as "bossy" (and thus being offered less money when aggressively negotiating their own salaries - IF they get hired at all) while men are seen as "decise" (and thus being offered MORE money when aggressively negotiating their own salaries) for the exact same behaviour;> Biases against women's efficiency, which leads to them being hired and promoted less often than men for the same qualifications/job done;> Women in "male" jobfields being subjected to harassment and hostile work environments by the men within them;> Women being expected to eventually leave the career, stay at home and raise children, thus being shamed if they don't (a \textbf{woman} in a couple who concentrates on her carrreer is seen as "selfish" because she denies her husband the chance of having children - nevermind that feminists don't care what parent is the stay-at-home one, so they're all for fathers being tha role if they want to);> Related to the above: motherhood penalty - employers give less promotions to women in a couple because "She's gonna leave her carreer to raise children, right? So why bother?". And no, it doesn't matter what the \textbf{woman} in question actually wants - to focus on her career or to stay at home, or even to have children or not - all it matters is whether her employers believe that she wants a family or not.Third objection: that wage gap statistic (21) refers mostly to white women. White women in 2014 made, specifically, 78 cents for every 1\$ white men make. African-american men: 71c. African-american women: 63c. Hispanic or Latino men: 61c. Hispanic or Latina women: 56c. [LINK] Rape culture: it doesn't exist because rape is ILLEGAL in the West.Rape culture isn't "rape is legal". Rape culture, as the first Google search will tell you, is described as "a term that was coined by feminists in the United States in the 1970's [...] designed to show the ways in which society blamed victims of \textbf{sexual} assault and normalized male \textbf{sexual} violence". Okay: what do those mean?"Normalized male \textbf{sexual} violence" means that male \textbf{sexual} violence (from catcalling to rape) is considered akin to a natural disaster: it happens, it's damaging for its victims, but we can't stop it, only contain the effects. Men groping girls? That's what men do. It's their sexuality. They can't help it. Men raping girls? Rapists cannot be teached not to rape. In fact, teaching people not to rape is nonsense - everyone know that rape is wrong.(Except for all those people who believe that someone who's "wasted, their body's \textbf{limp}, slurring their words, can't communicate clearly, maybe they're throwing up" is capable of giving a meaningful verbal "yes" to \textbf{sex}. Or those who believe that a wife should always consent to \textbf{sex} with her husband because she vowed to obey him. Or those who believe that an erection or an orgasm means that they consented to it. Et cetera...)"Society blamed victims", aka victim blaming: Since teaching how to not rape is out of the question, the only option left is to teach how to not get raped. Don't go out alone, don't drink, don't wear "provocative" clothing, don't be with strangers, don't give them the wrong idea, don't reject them too bluntly lest they get offended... Except that (A) most of these advices don't work (for example: clothing has \textbf{zero} impact on rape), often because they assume that most rape is committed by strangers (it isn't - most rapes are committed by people known to the victim); (B) they unfairly limit women's social life, while men aren't subjected to the same restrictions; (C) even if they did work, all they do is to displace rape from you to someone else who happened to not having been able to perfeclty follow all the rules; and (D) they blame the victim, because the underlined message of "Do \textbf{ABC}... so that you don't get raped" is "If you get raped, it's because you didn't do \textbf{ABC}...".Oh, and (E): if a \textbf{woman} does follow all the "advice" for "protecting herself from rapists", she's treated as a misandrist because she distrusts men.Not to mention another myth that goes around: that women lie all the time about having been raped. It's just that: a myth. False rape accusations are no more \textbf{common} than false accusations in general, and they're very unlikely to result in an unjust conviction (200 wrongful convictions for rape from 1989 to 2913, not all of which were due to false accusations; versus 80.000 rape cases in 2012 alone.) [LINK] End result: women are told to unreasonably limit their social lives in order to "not get raped", they get raped anyway, society blames them for "being careless" or for "giving him the wrong idea" (aka "You didn't say 'no' clearly enough"), the police refuses to investigate because "Women lie about rape all the time", juries refuse to convict rapists because "She led him on", rape victims don't even report having been raped because why bother when you only have a 3 chance of getting your rapist convicted, rapists are free to rape again and again playing on the myths that make it so that rape victims are disbelieved. Remember Steubenville? There was video proof of the rape, but the town still claimed that she was lying, and cried about the poor rapists having their future ruined.

Even when we take in account all the differences in jobs, hours worked and efficiency, there's STILL a 7 difference that cannot be explained that way." 7 is absolutely \textbf{nothing} in perspective, you apply that per person and it becomes a negligible amount, it's stretched across 104million women, it's not 7 per person, Dario doesn't seem to understand economics. Not to mention it's decreasing as time goes on but in the \textbf{age} gap of 20-30 it's gone completely the other way, and this is the best control group due to the lack of having other life responsibilities and that is purely because of social pressure put on employers. His last point is also stupid because Asian Women out earn White men which completely disproves any minority bias and the statistics he goes on to list are just Median statistics again which we already know don't explain anything...The rest of his rape spiel is also \textbf{dumb} as fuck "Not to mention another myth that goes around: that women lie all the time about having been raped.

Yes Dario... rape cases not fucking rape convictions which are at 5.7 found guilty, so we have false accusation of 2-8 and rape convictions where guilt is proven at 5.7 and the other 90ish being unproven, so that's 90 of RAPE CASES where the justice system can't determine it either way but in Dario's mind it's fine to just assume the 90 of cases thrown out in court due to lack of evidence actual rapes took place 100 of the time, because he knows more than the justice system.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Alien, Common, Dumb, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Youngsters, Nationality - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}5/347 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.441 \\  \hline

I agree with this video and in general most of what Laci says, though I'm still afraid of calling myself a feminist because often when i think if the word I get images of people shouting out for equal right yet going about it in a way that demonizes or belittles specific people, often times men, as if it's entirely a man's fault that \textbf{sexism} exists. \textbf{Sexism} in our culture isn't something men actively go out into the world looking to force upon women any more than society as a whole does. From an early \textbf{age}, birth, people are forced into a \textbf{gender} role by their parents and that becomes a defining factor for who that person is raised to be. This happens to both men and women and there are benefits and disadvantages to both roles. Men often grow to be more confident and assertive in their general outtakes on life than women but much less social and accepting of feelings and emotion. A boy runs through the yard he is encouraged but a girl runs through the yard she's told to be more careful... these sorts of attitudes in raising our children are what create the massive problem of \textbf{sexism}. it leads to men seeking and finding more leadership like roles in the workforce while most \textbf{woman} feel more comfortable with other careers. The attitudes we are raised with are then re enforced by the adults in our lives and the very society adults before us designed and put into place. If we change how children are raised, teach more \textbf{gender} neutral concepts, then the next generation will be in a far better position to make real change for equality than the feminism movement of today. Rather than blaming men, how about we tell it like it is, a problem that's ingrained into the very fabric of society and affects not only women, but men too and \textbf{transgender} people more than both aforementioned. If we look to the source and try to make a change in that way rather than blaming specific groups or individuals we'll all be far better off.Laci often points out great topics and in this video she even addresses \textbf{sexism} as it is, something against women that affects everyone in our society, not just women. Laci's probably the most inspirational feminist I've come into contact with and I'm certain glad to have found her videos, even if on some rare occasions i do happen to disagree.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small +theendman Yes, it would be impossible to solve. Let's take, for example, the problem with "the vast majority of combat roles deaths are men". Yes, it's true, but why? Because there's a \textbf{gender} ban that exempts women from being drafted. Okay, so the problem is this \textbf{gender} ban.Now, who made this \textbf{gender} ban? Was it women? No - in fact, the National Organization for Women has placed a lawsuit against the \textbf{gender} ban since 1980. Who opposed that lawsuit?- The USA Senate (98 male in 1980);- The USA House of Representatives (97 male);- The Supreme Court (100 male). [LINK] - Why did they do that? Because of \textbf{misogyny}. Specifically, because of the prejudice that women are physically weaker than men, more emotional than men, more hysterical than men, and overall incapable of being a soldier - unlike men.Here's why misogynists cannot resolve the problem of the combat deaths disparity: because it's caused by their own \textbf{misogyny}.Men die in combat because they're forced to be drafted, but women are not! How do we balance this disequality? By lifting the \textbf{gender} ban and letting women in the army! But women are weak, which means they can't be soldiers! Only men can soldiers - therefore only men die in combat roles! Men die in combat because they're forced to be drafted, but women are not! Et cetera and cetera.The same goes for workplace deaths. Misogynists want it so that it's not only men who have to get in dangerous workplaces and risk their lives, but at the same time they don't want women in "men's jobs" (aka dangerous workplaces).\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender, Misogyny & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}7/273 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.564 \\  \hline

It's literally impossible to do that and pursue a full-time high-pay career.- Only half of employers give women any sort of maternity pay. [LINK] - Women are hired less often than men, independently from their efficency. In the linked study below, 2 men were hired for each \textbf{woman}, but for every "mistake" where the hiring manager hired the less efficent candidate, 90 of the time it picked the man instead of the more efficient \textbf{woman}. [LINK] - Women are offered less money than their male co-applicants with the exact same copy-pasted qualifications. We're talking 4.000\$ less. [LINK] - Women are also being given promotions a lot less than men. [LINK] - There are female sewer workers. They're discriminated, because sewer work is considered a "man's job". [LINK] - There are female mining unions, because they were - and still are - discriminated against. Because mining is considered a "man's job". [LINK]  [LINK] - The \textbf{gender} ban against women in combat roles will be lifted only in 2016.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@theendman You forgot point 2 and 3. Specifically: no, feminists were NOT the ones that made it so that women were excluded from combat roles. Misogynists did.In 1980, when there was talking about wheter to re-instate the draft or not, various feminists organizations such as the National Organization for Women and ACLU's Women's Right Project opposed the draft period, but also pushed that, if the draft was to be re-instated, then women should've been included. Both the Senate (98 male at the time) and the House of Representatives (97 male) voted against allowing women in combat roles. Why? Because women were considered to be weaker, more emotional, more hysterical than men, and overall bad soldiers.NOW then filed a lawsuit to the Supreme Court, in order to reverse the decision. The Court rejected the lawsuit. It was 1980; the first female judge would've been allowed in the Supreme court in 1981. [LINK] As for this bit of yours:You must be living in the 1970's if you believe that "women are expected to stay home" Live in the new times please.Have you missed the massive discriminations that women face in pretty much any workfield that isn't considered to be "feminine"?

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@theendman I wouldn't want inferior soldiers but if they want to try they can.First: no, they cannot. I repeat: there's a ban in the USA army that forbids women from being assigned combat roles. This is a fucking LAW. Until the law is changed, USA women CANNOT be put in combat roles. Did men try to change the law? No, they didn't. I've already pointed to you how the USA institutions had the opportunity to lift the \textbf{gender} ban in 1980, and refused to do it. The prevalently male (Senate 98, House of Rep. 97, Supreme Court 100) institutions, I add.Second: so you've admitted that you consider women to be inferior soldiers than men. that's the root of the problem. If you believe women to be inferior soldiers to men no matter what, then you don't want them to be in combat roles, because you don't want weak soldiers. Is the exact same reasoning the USA institutions had in 1980 when they confirmed the \textbf{gender} ban: they prohibit women from getting in the Army because they believed (wrongly) that women were overall incapable of being soldiers.And if women, by that logic, cannot be soldiers, only men can. As long as you people continue to push misogynistic bullshit like this one, you will NEVER solve the combat death disparity.> It is beneficial to them because they don't have to get up and do something dangerous and therefore it is inequality for men because they are FORCED at times to do these things were women just get to laugh and play and laugh at men because they think they are better because they don't need to do ANYTHING!!!!!Really? Not being allowed to work is "laugh and play"?Not being allowed to vote is "laugh and play"?Not being allowed to partecipate in the political life of your own country is "laugh and play"?Having to obey your spouse in everything no matter what you want is "laugh and play"?Because that's what this evopsych bullshit ultimately comes to: the idea that men, the "real people", are the ones who make civilization; women instead are \textbf{nothing} more than emotional, frail children, who should be allowed only to stay at home and take care of the husband and the kids, the poor things.PS: in case you didn't noticed, women didn't "do ANYTHING!!!!!" when it came to the draft. The National Organization for Women protested against it. ACLU Women's Rights Project protested against it. They also protested against the \textbf{gender} ban. They got the fucking President Jimmy Carter to acknowledge the problem, and to urge the Congress to lift it. The Congress didn't. The Supreme Court didn't. All because they were men who believed the prejudice that women are "weak", are "hysterical", are "too emotional". They had similar beliefs to yours. And they caused the combat deaths disparity that you're whining about.So go on. Keep blaming women. Keep holding to that \textbf{misogyny}. Keep hurting women, and keep hurting men, and never realize that it's your belief's fault.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The \textbf{sexism} I face as a man is a lot more about the general \textbf{misandry} of society and the shaming of masculinity.Yes, I naturally value and admire strength and power. I feel proud of myself when I accomplish things. I need hardship. Being comfortable tend to depress me as there's \textbf{nothing} for me to be proud of.No, I don't like to "share my feelings". As I don't have the natural instinct to ask for support from someone else, sharing my feelings doesn't reward me with anything. Someone knowing about my feelings won't change the reason why I feel this way.The only thing sharing my feelings can accomplish is to give tools to someone else to manipulate me.Yes, I do like sports (in my case running) and I never felt satisfaction doing more "social" activities. Activities without competition or clearly defined goals are just boring to me.The idea that men feel pressure to use violence or intimidation to solve problem, so indirectly that women don't do it, is just sexist. I was the victim of vicious intimidation from women a lot more than from men.I really don't need social pressure to desire \textbf{sex}. This is quite natural for me, thank you. Also, as I naturally rely on myself rather than on someone else to solve my problems, romantic relationship don't bring me much, apart from easy \textbf{sex}. I don't consider women as \textbf{sex} objects, I'm fully aware of their emotions and individuality, but as I don't need support, \textbf{sex} is the only thing of value a \textbf{woman} can offer me.The social organization I'm most comfortable with is one which is hierarchical and where tasks are clearly distributed. I like clear social organization where everyone is responsible of his own task, I hate when it is muddy and based on constant negotiation. The only "negotiation" which is acceptable for me is the punctual challenging of authority. So yes, for me it's natural to establish "dominance" as this is what defines hierarchy.All the rest are consequence of this.Yes, I do like to feel as the protector. This is an obvious consequence of valuing strength.Yes, I do like dangerous jobs. This is again an obvious consequence of having the need to accomplish things.Yes, I do feel the need to "lead", but only when this leadership is related to my tasks and when I feel I'm the most competent. This is a consequence of wanting a social organization based on hierarchy.So that's who I am and this is what I value. And this video is hinting at the idea that I'm really not like that, that what I desire is only the consequence of "\textbf{sexism}" and that I'm a victim.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I think a lot of the people in the comments who are upset with the way she portrayed this issue in her video have some valid points, BUT I'm still very pleased she decided to address this issue at all. Here's a way-too-long reason why:In seventh grade a girl slapped me. I slapped her back. A fight happened. I went to report what happened to a school faculty member, everyone said I had started it, because guys don't hit girls. It's not that there was anything okay with me slapping her; it's that not only would it not have happened if she hadn't slapped me first (not saying as an excuse, simply a cause and effect), but even if I hadn't slapped her back, everyone still would've thought it was okay for her to do that. It was aggressive of her. I was just supposed to take it. That's a side of \textbf{sexism} that I don't see addressed in this video.About three years later, a completely unrelated argument led to a girl saying straight to my face "You can't be sexist to a man". Not because I provoked her, but because she did (and still does) truly believe that. That hurt worse, because in spite of what happened to me in the seventh grade, I had never had someone outright say to me that I didn't even have a RIGHT to feel like what happened was wrong. It hurt more than if I had just got hit in the face again (which, ironically, did happen... my track record's not great :(Tl;dr I absolutely do NOT like the way that Laci talked about this issue in her video. But I greatly appreciate the fact that she talked about it at all.

I believe that any person can choose what he wants regardless of his \textbf{gender} and thats why \textbf{gender} roles are bullshit, they are a human invention that does no one a favor.Just look how society imposes these roles. as a male if i become a hair dresser, a model a dress designer, a makeup artist, if i like the color pink, if i cry, if i show emotion, i will be heavily criticized as a \textbf{pussy}, a girl,a \textbf{woman} etc.... and this happens even with our children, when boys don't behave in a "boyish" way they get feedback like "he talks like a girl" "he walks like girls" "he throws like a girl" etc...The same with girls. All of this starts in a young \textbf{age}, we teach young kids that boys are this and girls are that, boys get army toys like tanks and fake guns as gift,and girls get dolls and miniature houses.This gives children an idea that boys have to be dominant and powerful and emotionless, and girls need to be soft and nurturing and that they should care only about cleaning cooking and looking beautiful.All of this results in a huge of bubble of social pressure once we grow up.Even as adults we have to be inside the \textbf{gender} role segregated world. Trust me, once we eliminate \textbf{gender} roles and teach each individual even from a young \textbf{age} to identify with whatever \textbf{gender} he wants and at the same time express himself the way he wants, behave how he wants, and be who he wants, once we do that, we will become a much better society.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Gender, Woman, pussy & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Gender - General, Nationality - Chinese & \cellcolor{green!5}10/323 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.096 \\  \hline

It has ALWAYS been regarded as a women-only job. That's around 20 years where that \textbf{woman} could maybe get a part-time job, where she could've just pursued her career, got her promotions and hearned a wage high enough to sustain the entire family. You know, the thing men (the traditional breadwinners) usually do.Second: even when we compare women in specific positions with men in those same positions, women are paid less and offered less chances at promotions because people believe that women are "naturally" less efficent than men, regardless of how efficent that specific female employee actually is.Here's two examples: -4000\$ in yearly pay. Female applicants had the exact same qualifications as male ones. [LINK] 2 men hired for each \textbf{woman}. When hiring managers chose the less efficent applicant (applicants underwent a test before meeting the managers, but the latters weren't allowed to see the test results), 80 of the time said less efficent applicant was the man. Even when allowed to know the test results, STILL 1,5 men hired for every \textbf{woman}. Again, it was more likely that a less efficent man was chosen over a more efficent \textbf{woman}, than a less efficent \textbf{woman} being chosen over a more efficent man. [LINK] That objection of yours has been countered to death. [LINK] The vast majority of rapists are men (If we consider prison rapes, then more than 99 of rapes are done by men).Rape isn't a matter of sexuality, but of power, of completely subjugating your victim.There often are violent hierarchies in prison.Abusers aren't allowed to choose the \textbf{gender} of their victims in prison - men and women are kept separate. Male rapists don't have access to female potential victims - only male ones.Conclusion: rapists rape men in prison because htat's what they have access to. If it was an actual preference, the incidence of \textbf{sexual} violence outside of prison wouldn't be this unbalanced towards female victims. > "\textbf{sexism} towards men is bad, because it's bad for women" HOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!That, right there, is the proof that you haven't watched the video.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender, Sexism, Sexual, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}11/528 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.083 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@mas9510 Look at those goalposts go galloping in the sunset!Re: Julie Bindel, I have two objections. One:Political lesbians are really crucial, because we were the ones that first said that women should be able to determine their own sexuality. We were the ones that said that all women can be lesbians and that heterosexuality is compulsory under a system of male supremacy. We were the ones that said that until women had a free choice, that we had to speak about heterosexuality as imposed upon us, rather freely chosen. This is completely unlike the mantra from the so called 'pro-\textbf{sex}' third wave feminists, who claim that we are anti \textbf{sex} and prudish. Political lesbians were the ones that said to women: 'you can be lesbians, you can be non monogamous, you can have loads of \textbf{sex}, with loads of women, you can enjoy \textbf{sex} and it doesn't have to be something that is imposed upon you, by the type of men that think foreplay is unpacking the shopping.'So I think political lesbianism has a crucial role, because it tells women that sexuality is political under a system of male supremacy. It tells us that \textbf{sexual} acts are all political and that none of them are without meaning. And it also clearly defines the fact that equality and meaningful \textbf{sexual} pleasure can be achieved far easier with women than it can be with men under this system.There you fucking go. She wasn't referring to actually ending heterosexuality, bur rather, to end the imposition of heterosexuality on people - specifically, the gender-normative heterosexuality that views \textbf{sex} as something that is for the enjoyment of men's desires only.Second: note the part that I've bolded.

Girls are strong and should feel strong without having to be told they are. Girls pleas know that you are capable of doing anything. If you are being told by feminist that you cant get a job in a man filled occupation because men won't hire you due to you being a \textbf{woman}, Please know that is not true. and feminist telling girls this is only going to discourage them. its like "why try if I'm going to fail".  positive outlooks are the key\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/189 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.529 \\  \hline

Personally I don't see why egalitarianism is a problem. It does all the same things feminism claims to do without the horribly off putting stigmas feminism has acquired over the years.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small A \textbf{gender} which is traditionally represented as part of a binary would be defined in opposition to its binary counterpart. Not exactly a revolutionary conclusion to draw.I'm not certain how teaching children to value "feminine" traits INSTEAD of "masculine" traits will help them in a capitalist democracy. We don't financially reward cooperation, we reward business decisions which increase profits and reduce expenses, which often require aggressive behaviours. We elect people into positions of power who have the capacity to dominate their subordinates. We celebrate people who fight back against their attackers, defending themselves and others. Non-violence wont save you from a (metaphorical) tiger. I agree that feminine traits should be valued and that \textbf{gender} norms should change, but that includes valuing those "masculine" traits as well. It saddens me that in a video about \textbf{sexism} and men the majority of the discussion was not focussed on men or the \textbf{sexism} men face. In any discussion with a feminist the "but what about men" response is justifiably met with derision. Women have issues of inequality they'd like addressed, lets do it and lets not get defensive and bring up every other group that has issues as though it somehow diminishes women's plight. But let's also have the same respect for men and their issues, especially if we'd like to ask them for help with correcting \textbf{gender} inequalities for women. The plight of third world women is far greater than the plight of first world women, but that's not a valid argument for failing to address \textbf{sexism} in the first world. By the same token women's plight may be greater than men's plight in the bid for equality, but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't address men's issues too. If we want to set the precedent of dealing with the "worst" inequalities first and foremost, I don't want to hear the term "manspreading" uttered until FGM, \textbf{sexual} slavery and honour killings have been eradicated from the world.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender, Sexism, Sexual & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}7/326 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.147 \\  \hline

So yes I agree... if anybody,  male or female is incredibly abusive to another person whom they disagree with online it's fucked up and could hurt the more mentally unstable people. What I'm trying to say is that it happens much more to women.  If you were to compare the comment sections of Mra videos with the comment sections of feminist videos (like Laci green) You wil find the majority of insults involving female genitals, female related swear words such as cunt ...and just general feminine sexist  stereotypes are more commonly directed at women on Both videos. This says a lot to me about our culture and how much men still objectify women ....because the I nternet is a microcosm of our culture . Just because people csnt see the trolls in person doesn't mean a whole lot of people are thinking in this degrading way...and it's a concern.

This is no n different from \textbf{black} rights and \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} rights which are all under the umbrella of human rights. Just becsuse there are cause representing certain demographics, doesn't mean they don't care about the persecution of other groups. By pointing out \textbf{sexism} (like, for example ,in this disgusting comment section) No one is saying that ALL men are bad or that they hate men. They're saying that there is a problem that  is big enough that it should be pointed out. By saying there is a type of male stereotype which is toxic and which should be discouraged - doesn't mean we are trying to femenize men....just encourage people to be less aggressive, sexually degrading and unable to express sadness, fear or pain because that would be 'unmanly'. Feminists themselves discourage this stereotype . it does a disservice to men....and no doubt one of the reasons the male suicide rate is so high is because all their lives they are encouraged to toughen up, boys don't cry etx etc. z feminists didn't encourage men to behave like that.....other men did.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Gay, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Gender - General, Sexual Identity - General, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality & \cellcolor{green!27}4/231 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.732 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small +Stella blue Ok first of all, \textbf{nobody} is making you try to fit in the "\textbf{gender} roles". In the west, you're lucky enough to not be oppressed. You have the freedom to do whatever you want without having anyone nagging at you. How are women in the west sexually degraded? Because they appear semi-naked in adverts and commercials? Well, guess what, they have signed a contract themselves, so they more than likely have been comfortable enough to show off their private bits. Since you're touching on this topic, I'd like to point out how when photos of semi-naked men are applauded but when it's a woman's image, it's seen as degrading by most feminists. A slur is only meaningful if you care enough about it. Toughen up, both men and women are abused in a physical, verbal or \textbf{sexual} manner all the time, most of the time, to a worse extent than being called a meaningless slur on the internet. On the internet you have the power to actually block people, it's not a big deal. Just block the person, and get on with your life. Be mature enough to let it go instead of holding onto it. I have never encountered an MRA channel, therefore I'd like to ask you to present me with a link to one, as for the feminist videos I've seen, most of them have radical views which are mostly about western women, instead of focusing on people who actually need it. Stereotypes are meaningless, it's your fault if you actually pay attention to them. Stereotypes are outdated at this point, but it's alright to make some banter out of them once in a while. Just because someone doesn't agree with your views, doesn't mean he's a troll. What Laci is doing IS wrong, because she isn't advocating equality between the sexes. If you want equality, you have to mention issues that both sexes face. Western women aren't even oppressed!

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I think a good argument worth mentioning in the defense of the way that masculinity is culturally defined through comparison to femininity as described in this video, is the concept of the essence and definition of a thing as garnered through perspective.  For example,  if you were to try to define or describe an \textbf{apple} without using the term '\textbf{apple}' how would you do this?  You could say that it's \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} or green or a \textbf{fruit} to start... with time and the definitions of other things that aren't apples you could eventually get to where you want to be.  You could do that for all forms of comparison and eventually you'll get pretty close to the definition of an \textbf{apple} without specifically using the term.   In a similar way, the definition of masculinity can be defined as what it is not.  In the case of masculinity however the benefit is that there are only two diametrically opposed concepts involved really, and that's because these concepts are arbitrarily formed through cultural development.   So in a kind of analytical way, if you have X and Y you can say that you know you are looking at X because you know that it isn't Y.  That however, presupposes you have a definition of Y, which again comes from cultural development.   In regards to the reality of the definition of masculinity, this kind of means that the collective of femininity has a lot of power to redefine.  As femininity becomes increasingly dynamic, masculinity is forced, through this method of definition, into an increasingly more narrow definition.  Of course such a notion doesn't hold to reality because eventually things hit a breaking point tipping point.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Apple, Fruit, Red & \cellcolor{green!5} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Ethnicity - Native-American, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality & \cellcolor{green!5}5/280 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.786 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small +Mentalidade Logica My question would be - how do you figure \textbf{sexism} does not hurt guys.  The current feminist structure is very, very sexist, and it hurt guys a lot.  Guys do not go into primary teaching, because they do not want to have it assumed they are pedophiles.  Women claims a guy did something, he is in effect guilty until he proves his innocence, invert the situation, and he is merely bellyaching, this is \textbf{sexism} - and it hurts guys.  The courts awards custody to women, unless they are proven child abusers because they are deemed better parents -regardless of the reality of that situation, that hurts men and children, and is due to \textbf{sexism}.    I know of one case where a baby was hurt, they did not even look at the wife, until the husband could establish he had not been alone with baby for months, and when confronted with this she fessed up.  She let him suffer scrutiny for a long time, and the only reason he was under it, was because he was a male.A \textbf{woman} hits a guy - even in public - well he must have had it coming, vice versa - people will jump in - \textbf{sexism}, and well hurts men.  There are no shelters for battered men, so they must either abandon their children, or suffer but there are many shelters for women - \textbf{sexism} - and hurts men.  In fact I would go so far as to say, men have a huge interest in \textbf{sexism}, they just do not realize it, because 3rd \& 4th wave feminists - wave defined \textbf{sexism} as only being situations that disadvantage women - period.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Sexism, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}8/280 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.857 \\  \hline

Just because female \textbf{sexism} is actually addressed unlike male \textbf{sexism} doesn't mean they suffer the VAST MAJORITY of it, and in itself acts as a form of male \textbf{sexism} because men's issues have no representation in our society. It's the same deal with slavery in the US. While it is true that \textbf{black} people were treated horribly and unfairly in the past, it should have no effect on the present. But, \textbf{black} people use it as a form of racial defense, and have made it so only white people can be targeted as a "\textbf{racist}", whether its justifiable or not in any given situation. Women have crafted the same reality from \textbf{sexism} against men, which is inherently sexist toward men in the same way the previous statement is \textbf{racist} toward white people. There's no doubt that women experience \textbf{sexism}, or that \textbf{black} people experience \textbf{racism}, in the modern day, but the lack of attention men/white people get on those respective fronts is unequal and only the first step into the bigger issue.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@NATHANIEL SMITH" in general men are the more aggressive" Untrue. You are simply using a generalisation that comes with being a Man. That "men" should be strong, aggressive ect.However in reality this is untrue, and this is why we see both men and women being violent.Women may be more likely to be aggressive to their partners than men according to the BPS. (1) Men and women are educated, traditionally, to carry out different social roles.Think of all the ways in which modern Western society teaches children that fighting is more suitable for men than to women.Folk literature and the media constantly present men, and not women, fighting. Parents buy toy guns for boys and dolls for girls.Parents are more willing to endorse and encourage the aggressive behavior of boys, and not of girls. Again and again, directly and indirectly, minors learn that men are aggressive, and women not [Berkowitz, 1993, p. 395].The theory of 'social roles' has created a new paradigm in \textbf{gender} policies and marks, even today, the ways in which many civic and preschool education strategies are developed.It is presumed that girls and boys shall be educated and treated alike, non-discriminatory, and even the behavioral differences between them will disappear.First of all, it's not the parents that impose behavioral styles on their children, but their reaction at the latter's requests; toy guns are bought for boys and dolls for girls because these are usually the children's preferences (in part genetically predetermined).And as parents respond to children's preformed wishes, so do media, offering a content which corresponds to behavioral patterns already existing on a social level [Hoyenga, Hoyenga, 1993].All of these anatomical, hormonal, behavioral and evolutionary factors demonstrate the biological, instinctual inclination of men to be more combative. Therefore, on an individual and social level, men are involved in acts of violence and crime. The social environment only cultivates and points out these predispositions towards fighting and aggression.(1)  [LINK] \normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/331 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.302 \\  \hline

Give me a fucking break.2. Men don't want to be like women because women like masculine men, I don't give 3 and a half fucks what your womens studies degree says or how much women chime in and say otherwise. "Theres only one way to be a man" today because not only are men genetically predisposed from birth to be like this, but the stereotypical traditional man is the only version of masculinity that women choose to sexually reward. The fact that women routinely use and neglect the emotionally available, non confrontational "nice guy" to go after the confident, well built, emotionally distant asshole who treats them like shit is all the proof I need of what women actually want in a guy. Ladies, (if i can even call you that anymore) you've got no one to blame but yourselves for this shit. 3. thats another thing, women saying what they want and then going after the complete opposite and then bitching about it when it blows up in their faces.4. What two consenting adults do in the privacy of their own home is none of my god damn business and i think most of everyone here would agree with me. However thats as far as it should go. Fags do NOT deserve parenting rights and tax breaks and marriage rights and all this other bullshit were granting them for being degenerates. They should be thankful were not dragging them out in the streets and lynching them anymore and that who they are is generally accepted now. But of course thats not enough.

Also, women have more gray matter while men have more white matter. This makes women more communicative then men and more likely to talk or gossip it out then get into a physical fight. 4.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Kevu Seth 1+3) And? If you're trying to argue BIOTRUTHS about how men and \textbf{woman} are "destined" to different jobs, then why do you oppose, say, men being forced to sign for the draft? They evolved for fighting, while women evolved for nurturing. So, no \textbf{woman} is fit for the Army; so, the draft being for men only is right. By opposing that, anti-feminists oppose nature.Or how about child custody? As for the above, women evolved for nurturing. So, they should get child custody over the man, always.Of course, I don't believe neither of the above. In fact, I don't believe that \textbf{gender} roles are primarily biological. I think they're primarily social constructs.2) This video is about how \textbf{sexism} hurts men. A good chunk of men's issues doesn't stem from \textbf{sexism} at all. The other part stems from the same exact \textbf{sexism} that places women as "weak, emotional, submissive" and men as "strong, rational, domineering" and shames whoever doesn't fit this rigid categorization.4) This is a bit vague.

There are always exceptions. I'm not saying women should be banned from the draft. It should be an integrated society. I'm just saying MEN ARE MORE LIKELY TO DO THE DRAFT. It's a mixed influence of decisions, culture, and biology. Look at the Turkish Peshmerga with their kick ass female army. Still, more men join the military but their culture influences for a \textbf{woman} to do that. I'm calling for an integrated society. I want this country to offer equality to let ANYONE do what they want based on merits, not \textbf{sex}. Same thing with the child custody situation. The better parents should be chosen. However, a mother is MORE LIKELY to be chosen as they TEND TO BE MORE NURTURING. Even Laci admits these are "feminine" characteristics. She wants men to express more of these. Everything we are and why we do things is caused by biology. I think you think I mean to say these are rigid characteristics all men and women need to follow.

A guy when upset by a breakup might go get some beer with his squad while a girl might watch a movie with Haagen Daz. Not saying the vice versa can't happen, but it is their decision. 4) Yes, I'm referring to these along with many other ones.

Who are these men you speak of? Where can I find them? I would really like to talk to these guys if what you are saying is true.All I am getting from this video is a straw-man attack on Masculinity itself by obfuscating masculine traits pertaining to strength, perseverance, drive, energy and determination and deceitfully equating them to evils such as abuse, shaming, apathy, cruelty and hegemony. You are talking to us as if we as men do not have intelligence to figure out that you are shaming us into your mold of what you as a feminist believes a man should be. How are you any less sexist than when society dictates what a \textbf{woman} should be?Emotional manipulation and cheap psychological bullying can only get you feminists so far. We as men have been tolerant of your BS to the point where we are now beginning to feel stupid for allowing you to degrade us this much.So much of the problems men face today are the direct result of the shaming and blaming of our entire \textbf{gender} by feminists like you who undermine our masculinity with propaganda, misinformation, shaming tactics and emotional manipulation. You accuse men, all men, of being sexists. But when men bring you legitimate cases where men are at a disadvantage and women hold all the cards you still concoct these \textbf{mental} gymnastics in order to still place the blame on men: "Men also suffer for their own \textbf{sexism}." Not once in your video did you even acknowledge that these sexist attitudes can be harbored by women. It is always the men who bully, not just women, but other men as well. Women good, Men bad. That is your entire spiel.\textbf{Homophobia} is directly connected to religiosity and NOT to masculinity. Those nations that are the most religious are also the most \textbf{homophobic} whereas those who are the least religious are the most tolerant. Now let me inject some context into your deceitfully simplistic example about power dominance and aggression.Power. This is the ability to have control over one's own destiny. Amazing how Power + Men = Evil, yet Power + Women = Progress. Power is not always something that one gains through force, very often it is through consent as in the case of a democracy. Power is a good thing when it is freely given to the most competent and efficient people in order to wield it in a position of leadership. Consenting power to competent leaders gives others the freedom to peruse other activities. In the case of a nuclear family a wife consenting that her husband have the power over certain aspects of the family frees her to exercise power over other aspects of the family. In this case the power is shared, it always has been! A husband, or any head of a family, is not a total dictator who controls the finances, nutrition, bed times and every other single facet of a family life. A wife can consent to give the husband power over finances in order for her to concentrate on the nutrition and education of her children.Dominance. In and of itself this is not evil nor detrimental. Dominance is virtually the same as Power. Dominance can be obtained through force just as it can be obtained through consent or just by mere efficiency and by out-competing others.Aggression. This can be synonymous with ambition. A life without aggression is bland, stale, lethargic and tends to wither on the vine. Aggression is a strong conviction towards a goal. In and of itself it is a brute force but when it is acted out under a masculine personality it is an integral part of our survival and growth. Aggression is always deceitfully treated by feminists as if it were an all-encompassing trait within men. It is equivalent to ripping off a body part and defining the whole body by analyzing just one appendage. This is very sick! Feminists love to butcher masculinity and then build some sort of Frankenstein's monster out of the dissected parts and then use it as a morbid sort of straw-man to attack and belittle our entire \textbf{gender}.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender, Homophobia, Homophobic, Mental, Sexism, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments, Sexual Identity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}7/742 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.943 \\  \hline

Have you ever seen a "MRA" website, like "A Voice For Men"? That's a pretty good start, though I suggest you to use donotlink.com to access those pages.All I am getting from this video is a straw-man attack on Masculinity itself by obfuscating masculine traits pertaining to strength, perseverance, drive, energy and determination [...]Citation needed. And what you're saying is false. This is an attack on:1) Various assholish and toxic beliefs (like "boys don't cry") that are passed off as "natural masculinity"; and2) The idea that, if you're a man, then you have to fully conform to a predefined set of "natural masculinity" behaviours; that, if you're a \textbf{woman}, then you have to fully conform to a predefined set of "natural femininity" behaviours; and that everything else is wrong.[...] you are shaming us into your mold of what you as a feminist believes a man should be. How are you any less sexist than when society dictates what a \textbf{woman} should be?Case in point. "Men don't have to be ABCDE and 100 masculine" means "Men CAN be ABCDE and 100 masculine, but also can choose to be something different". It doesn't mean "Men can't be ABCDE and 100 masculine because I said so".So much of the problems men face today are the direct result of the shaming and blaming of our entire \textbf{gender} by feminists like you [...]Name one.\textbf{Homophobia} is directly connected to religiosity and NOT to masculinity.No, \textbf{homophobia} is connected with the idea of rigid \textbf{gender} stereotypes. It's connected with the idea that men have to be ABCDE and women have to be VWXYZ, and that everything else is wrong. Case in point: the idea that it's "natural" for men to be attracted to women, and that it's "natural" for women to be attracted to men, and that anything else is a sin/mental sickness/wrong.Power. This is the ability to have control over one's own destiny.Power can be expressed in terms of class and groups, in which case it's often expressed in the form of one group oppressing the other.Since we're in argument: name one way in which women as a whole are oppressing men as a whole in our recent society.Amazing how Power + Men = Evil, yet Power + Women = Progress.The problem is that women have been excluded from power for a long time, for no reason other than "nature" bullshit. So it's more like:Power + Men = DisparityPower + Men + Women = Equality.Case in point: your example about family. Which falls apart because it isn't a choice - women are expected to take the child-raising role. The vast majority of men refuses to take that role. So that \textbf{woman} is forced to choose: (1) Continue to pursue the full-time high-pay career (for ex. doctor or lawyer) and gain financial indipendency. You can't have kids - you don't want to take care of them, your husband doesn't want to either, so there's \textbf{nobody} who would take care of them. (2) Stay at home and raise the kids. During that period, you can't get a full-time high-pay job because, well, you have to stay at home and take care of the kids. At best, you can take a part-time job during that period, and a full-time low-wage job after it.Meanwhile, men almost always choose "I pursue my full-time high-pay career, my wife stays at home and raises the kids", and almost never choose the opposite.And yes, it IS a choice on their part - if the vast majority of women wanted to stay at home and raise the kids, why did they bother to get higher education? Why did female attendance for colleges and universities has been growing nonstop for the past 20+ years? [LINK] Not to mention that this "rigid parental roles" setup produces the following effects: (1) Women can't develop their own financial independency if they get a family. Which means that the economic factor is what they'll look for in a guy. And relationships based on how much money your husband brings home is a lot less stable than one based on an actual emotional relationship - cue an increase of divorces. (2) When it comes to child custody, family courts favor the children's "primary care-giver" - the parent who took care of the kids the most, who meets their needs, and overall the parent who's most beneficial in the kid's education and growth. With this setup, mothers are the ones fitting that role; and yet, there's a lot of guys lamenting about the "child custody disparity". [LINK]  (3) The same goes with alimony. The parent who stayed at home and took care of the kids wasn't "slacking off" - they took care of the kids, and allowed the other parent to work, pursue their own career and make that money. But, without the possibility of alimony, the stay-at-home parent is disadvantaged because the bread-winning parent could threatening to divorce the SAH parent, leaving them without the means to sustain themselves and the kids. Again: with this setup, women are the SAH parent and the ones who deserve alimony, but there's a lot of guys (the BW parents) lamenting about paying alimony. [LINK] Aggression. This can be synonymous with ambition.No. Aggression and ambition are two different things.And the fact that men make up the vast majority of violent crime perpetrators is a proven fact.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender, Homophobia, Nobody, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Gender - General, Sexual Identity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}8/958 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.835 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@xTSx Clan Here's a small thing to think about on the idea that society was and is sexist against women. We all know feminists claim women were oppressed by the men through \textbf{patriarchy}. But now imagine you have a boat, 100 years ago, when \textbf{sexism} was supposed to be rampant, as well as \textbf{racism}.Now imagine you have a boat half full of whites, half full of blacks, and it starts sinking. The whites decide who of the two will be saved. It's quite obvious they'd leave the blacks to die because they didn't value them much, and it's to be expected since blacks were oppressed in general, second class citizens, at least in the case of the USA.Anyway, now we pick a boat full of white people, but half are children. As to be expected, the most likely result is saving the children, because they were highly valued, and people would have protected them.Finally, the boat is full of men and women from the same social class. The men decide who gets saved. It's obvious they wouldn't die for "second class citizen" or people they wouldn't value much. It's also obvious they'd save high value people (supposing they have some decency), even if it means their own death. So if women were "second class citizen" and "oppressed", why the fuck did the men decide to value the lives of women as highly as those of children, and die instead of them ? Interestingly enough the Titanic shows exactly this (famous example so easy to find information).So women were as highly valued as children, and in fact you can find many more similarities in how both were treated.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@sanos999 It kinda is.First of all: the vast majority of rapes outside of prison are from men against women. So, rape definitely has a heavy sexist component.Second: rape is about power, about utterly dominating and abusing someone else. The perpetrator's sexuality is a secondary factor.Third: prisons are divided by \textbf{gender}. So male rapists have access solely to possible male victims.Fourth: you know how violent criminals commit violent acts to signify their "status" within a group? It's even worse in prison.Conclusion: male rapists rape men (the only kind of victims available) in prison as a way to mantain their belief that they have the "power". Outside of it, they target those wo see as "inferior" - namely, women.Add other factors, such as:- The public belief that criminals "deserve to suffer in prison";- The shaming of any man who "acts like a \textbf{woman}" (for example: \textbf{fag}, girl, \textbf{pussy}, mangina...); that includes "he's been raped like a bitch";- The general belief that criminals lie about having been raped in order to get special tratment (generally, the people saying that are the same people who believe that "women falsely accuse men of rape to get attention");and you get a fucking nightmare for prison rape victims' hopes of getting any justice or help.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@The Boss Stage1 That's a half-truth.First, it's not "biased judged give men harsher sentences". It's "biased judges give women lighter sentences". Which, by itself, means jack shit - giving special treatment to one group is still discrimination against everyone else.The problem arrives when people try to claim that this judicial bias is the fault of women. They're wrong. Why? Turns out it's male judges that are biased and more lenient towards female offenders. Female judges give to every \textbf{gender} the same sentences those biased judges give to male offenders.> The findings regarding \textbf{gender} in the case of serious offenses are quite striking: the greater the proportion of female judges in a district, the lower the \textbf{gender} disparity for that district. I interpret this as evidence of a paternalistic bias among male judges that favors women. [LINK] So, what the hell is happening? In short, there's a lot of sexist beliefs that paints women as demure, emotional, submissive, less capable of logical thought, less physically strong than men, etc. This has been used to justify, for example, keeping women out of the Army or other physically demanding jobs; in THIS case, however, this stereotype also paints women as less capable of violence, both in terms of "being less capable of causing physical damage (especially against a STRONG MANLY MAN)", and in terms of "women abhor violence, they're psychologically incapable of acting violent".Therefore: female offenders are treated as less responsible than male offenders because they're believed to (A) cause less damage than men (regardless of how much damage that particular culprit caused), and (B) less responsible than male culprits (male criminal = "he's a criminal", female criminal = "they made her a criminal").Now, here's the thing: if women were the ones abusing their privilege, female judges would've been the ones giving unfair sentences. They aren't; male judges make up the bulk of the unfair ones.And not only feminists are NOT defending this judicial bias, but, since they've been (and still are) fighting for tearing down \textbf{gender} divisions, they're also fighting for more equal representation in the judicial system, which means more female judges, which means less \textbf{gender} bias.TL;dr: yes, there is a \textbf{gender} sentencing bias.

Where does this notion that it's either men be "free of the patriarchal bonds" or be jocky alpha males come from? Since the dawn of history there have been different types of men that have been free to be themselves. We have athletes, scientists, criminals, heroes, soldiers, builders, politicans, writers, mean guys, nice guys. conservatives, liberals, musicians, nerds, jocks, priests, monks, cops, teachers, chefs, and on and on.

There will always be a sub-set of narrow-minded alpha types just like there will always be sensitive more open-minded men. It's just part of our wide spectrum.

The zipper scene in There's Something About Mary? While not castration it certainly plays on male genital mutilation for a punchline Yes, women can be critizised for putting themselves in dangerous or irresponsible situations regardless of the outcome if she did so willingly. The man can go to jail for his felonious actions. Women are expected to stay at home and take care of the kids? Maybe...Depends on the relationship dynamic. If the man has more income or they are a traditional couple, then perhaps that is the plan THEY chose. All my friends seem to mutually plan out how they child rearing will fall to. I never hear anyone say anymore that "It's the women's job!" Also, biological reasons such as breast milk can also make it more advantageous for the mother to be around the child more. Women and men can both choose full-time careers. Again, if one career is more sustainable than the other, then I would guess that person keeps their job, or they get a nanny if they are well off. The rest is easily refuted too, but I don't want to type more...Lastly "I'm not saying "all men are like this".

Judging by how many bother to get the required higher education, the answer is yes.Do men stay at home and take care of the kids? No. And it's not like all of them are impossibilitated because they're the only ones who can bring the big paycheck home, given that, again, a lot of women have the higher education required to get the big paycheck. It's a matter of choice, pure and simple.4) Congratulations for ignoring everything that you can't excuse your way through.5) No, it's not sexist.

Women will typically seek these men to benefit as well, such as financial stability and a greater potential to start/support a family. Women who do not like men can go their own way completely, and this whole discussion is a non-issue for them.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Capn Whiskey I can't believe I have to explain this point-by-point.1 - If you want to have a family, someone has to take care of the kids. That's a fact that cannot be avoided.2 - Given that most families don't have a deposit full of coins, then one member of the couple will have to do the child-raising.3 - A full-time, good-pay career guarantees financial indipendence. It's also time-consuming - so much that it's pretty much impossible to work full-time AND properly take care of the kids without any help.4 - Combining 2 and 3 above, a member of the couple will have to take child-raising duty and forgo having a full-time job.5 - Here's the catch: a lot of men not only choose to be the bread-winners, but think that's the father's role, always, while the mother's role is to stay at home and raise the kids.6 - Since someone has to stay at home, and since men almost always choose NOT to, then that leaves women. Unless, of course, they forgo the chance of growing a family.Men get both options: they get to pursue the careers, while the wifes raise the children for them. (Besides then whining because they have to pay aliments. Family courts rule to the advantage of the children - and what the children need is to be able to stay with the parent that took care of them the most. Guess which parent usually is in that role?)Now, I'm going to predict your objection: "Women choose to stay at home because they want to have a family".While a lot of women do want to have a family, a lot of women also want to have a good career. Case in point: the continued increase of women going to college from the seventies to this day.(By the way, do you know what it means to mantain this rigid "husbands breadwinners, wifes child-raiser" mentality? It means denying economic indipendence to women, because, if they want children, they'll have to forgo having a full-time job, while men get the job AND a wife who does the child-rising for them.)(And also guess what happens it that rigid system? That the major indicator for a \textbf{woman} seeking a husband is money. Not love, not \textbf{common} interests, money. The rigid-gender-roles system reduces the quality of marriages, rendering them based on pure economic factors rather than actual relationships, and produces an increased incidence in divorces.)\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Common, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}2/415 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.482 \\  \hline

It's NATCHURRRRE. Then you turn right around and blame women for staying at home and "forcing" men to go to work. Nevermind that, as I've repeatedly shown you, men hold the cultural power in our society and enforced those sexist stereotypes in the first place.>  [LINK] Some quotes from that link you gave me (all emphasis is mine):- A 2010 Cornell study found that among 18- 28-year-old married and cohabiting couples who had been together for more than a year, men who were totally dependent on women's salaries were five times more likely to cheat than men who earned the same as their partners. Other studies show that when women earn more, they wind up taking on more, not less of the housework and childcare. A 2013 study by a professor at Washington University's Olin Business School in St. Louis who collaborated with some Danish colleagues revealed that in relationships where women made slightly more than their spouses, men were 10 more likely to need prescription medication for erectile dysfunction, insomnia and anxiety, and the greater the income gap, the more problems men had with ED. Torabi conducted her own survey of 1,033 professional women and found that the women who made more than their partners reported less relationship satisfaction and more embarrassment about how much they made compared to their spouse than the women who earned less.- It's emasculating and wrong to cut your spouse out of your family financial decision-making just because you earn more. Under no circumstances should we financially 'mommy' our husbands. Appreciate all the non-monetary contributions your husband makes. If you can afford it, pay for household chores like cleaning, laundry and childcare, that get you both down.  Most important, put some thought into the wounds that unequal earning power can create. The phenomenon of the breadwinning \textbf{woman} will only keep growing.Gee, it seems like people are NOT happy when one spouse uses the fact that they're the breadwinner to hold all the decisional power in a couple. Who would've thought? [LINK]  [LINK]  (page 3) [LINK] But how to change this idea of rigid \textbf{gender} roles, where the breadwinner (usually the MANN) holds all decisional power in the couple?

Certainly not feminists! </sarcasm> [LINK]  [LINK]  [LINK]  [LINK]  [LINK] > Fact is, that women want to marry up......despite the fact that women's attendance rate to higher education as been continually increasing since the '70s. I repeat: why bother to get the education required for a full-time high-pay career if you aren't going to actually pursue a full-time high-pay career?> men dont care about marrying downBecause they take "the \textbf{woman} of the house doesn't work, or at least makes less than the man" as granted. Meanwhile, women with the potential to gain more than their husbands sometimes decide not to, because they feel it isn't worth the resentment of their husbands in doing so (see my previous links about the way men feel less satisfied when the wife is the breadwinner).>  [LINK] Here's a quote from that link:- And perhaps a little relieved. Betsy thought she was the only mother in their grade supporting a stay-at-home husband— especially one who refused to polish the surfaces. 'It's like one of those things,' she says, 'where you realize you're married to people who drink.'As for Evan Marc Katz, she flat-out states that high-earning money don't want to settle with low-earning partners. Despite the fact that they do. [LINK] > I want to be a stay at home father, personally, I really feel this way... however, most women only laugh at me when I mention this... why?Because the women you're around have been taught that a stay-at-home man is either a deadbeat dad, or something straight out of a sitcom.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Robin Miller 1) So, first of all: you wanted proof that feminists have been against the stigma of rigid \textbf{gender} roles (men = breadwinners, women = stay at home). Here are some of the relevant quotes:- Wives and daughters were subjected to the 'headship' of men – no decision was to be made without the permission of the husband or father. Family planning, pants, college, and outside employment were all frowned upon; a \textbf{woman}'s place was at the kitchen table, homeschooling a gaggle of obedient children. When I was sixteen, I told a friend that I didn't see any reason for girls to go to college. After all, what's the point of going to college if you're going to stay home raising kids for the rest of your life?- When I was at work I'd listen to sermons on my iPod about what it meant to be a 'real man.' The masculinity I heard preached was exciting – glorious, honorable, rough, violent. It eschewed 'limp-wristed girly-men' and stay-at-home dads alike.  A man's job was to work hard to provide for his family; a \textbf{woman}'s job was to take care of the household and children and always be cheerfully available for \textbf{sex}. It was a vision of masculinity perfectly designed for my black-and-white view of the world.- But shortly after we were married, we began to realize that we did not fit into the neat boxes so often prescribed by preachers and books.Before that, the guy wrote this. it puts in perspective how, exactly, women get the short end of the stick. [LINK] 2) As I've said, Marc Katz states that women "don't marry down". This is false, for two motives. First: there's a wage gap. The average female worker earns roughly three-quarters of the average male worker. So of-fucking-course it's more probable that the wife is the one making less money. [LINK] Now, even with that disparity, the percentage of couples where the wife's income tops the husband's was 22 in 2007. [LINK] So, yes, there IS a sizable amount of high-income women that marry with lower-income men. Fact is, the vast majority of women are low-income, which is why most couples feature a lower-income wife.Also, Evan is a man. The second link is a citation of a NY Times interview with a \textbf{woman}. Neither Marc Katz nor the interviewed \textbf{woman} are scientists.3) > [...] women want men to make more, raise their social status and endow them with the wealth earned throw any means, regardless of the nature of the business! Women dont care if their partners are mass murders and tyrants, as long as these powerful men raise the womans position in the social heirarchy!

I've honest-to-whatever-god-is-passing-by got \textbf{NOTHING}. You're genuinely blaming women for somehow "causing" men to accrue power - economical, religious, political, cultural - on their own \textbf{gender}, despite the fact that men have ALWAYS tried to use that privilege to oppress women, from discrimination on the job to denying them the right to vote to the massive "feminists will turn your son into lesbians!!!" anti-feminist bullshit.Not only that, but you're trying to argue that women, somehow and without holding any kind of sizable political power themselves, caused dictatorships.This is \textbf{dumb}. No, wait, that's not the right word. This is a Poe's Law moment. This has gotten to the point where half of my brain is calling you a troll, and the other half is reminding the first "No, they really think that".4) > see how men are over 9 to 1 the homeless in this and most countries compared to women)...So, I've read the link. Via DoNotLink, because I'm not willing to give AVfM even just a tick on the visitor count.So, the first link refers to the US Interagency Council on Homelessness. The author coughs two statistics: "75 of the chronic homeless are male", and "97 of homeless veterans are male". The page linked in AVfM article doesn't give any information whatsoever about the \textbf{gender} demographics of the homeless. So I had to search for it myself. This is what I found: [LINK] Page 20 > In 2011 (AVfM's article was from 2013, but this is the most recent completed report), the percentage of sheltered homeless men was 63 of the sheltered homeless population, and has been continually decreasing since '07. The adult US popolation (homeless or not), for reference, was a 49/51 situation from '07 to '11. (I know, this data looks useless, but bear with me.)Page 34 > If we look at individual homeless - that is, homeless people that live alone - then the percentage rises to 72. The problem is that percentage is the one used (incorrectly) by AVfM to represent all the homeless adults. The percentage of the US individuals (people who don't live with a family, homeless or not) has been 50/50 in the '07-'11 period. So, there's an inbalance against men.Page 46 > If we look instead at homeless adults with children, then the percentage of male adults drops to 21. If we look at the adults in the US that have children, homeless or not, we see that it was a 45/55 situation. So, there's an inbalance against women.Page 58 > On to veterans. AVfM does correctly report that 90 of homeless veterans are male (slight decrease since '07). What they did fail to mention was the demographics of the veteran population, homeless or not: 93 male, 7 female. There's no significative inbalance between the original population, and the homeless people from that population. Gee, I wonder why they omitted that part.As for the Alicia Patterson Foundation link (the second given by AVfM), the author doesn't provide any scientific source whatsoever.Moreover, there's a bigger issue: as far as I was able to gather, AVfM didn't do one single thing for reducing the homeless population. Not one thing. They didn't offer help to shelters, they didn't ran charities for funding male shelters - \textbf{nothing}. The most they've done was attacking female shelters just for existing, for supposedly "taking away fundings from male shelters". Nevermind that the bulk of a shelter's funding has always been voluntary donations. And nevermind the fact that the Violence Against Women Act is \textbf{gender}-neutral in anything but the name, so they could use that to get some funds.

Ineffectively, I add, given that feminists are NOT making those issues worse - if anything, they're trying to fix some of them.> Paul Elam: Well, I can best start by telling you what it is not, from my own personal point of view. It is not about passing a Violence Against Men Act or any other form of government reliance on justice and personal liberty. … There are no plans to form a committee for research for testicular cancer or to build a men's shelter. AVFM does not have a program to reform family courts. … Neither I nor AVFM has a legislative agenda, nor any politicians to endorse, nor lobbying to accomplish because none of that is of any value in a society that still refuses to accept reality.

I can tell you that out of all my friends and acquaintances, I've found none that only value  women as walking fleshlights. I'm not entirely sure how this misconception got around, but it's inaccurate and annoying to see pop up over and over the place. At 0:41, "To make "Harmless Jabs at each other to establish dominance" I'm not too clear, are you saying that back and forth banter is somehow stigmatizing men? The very purpose of banter is to get a few laughs and test your wit against a friend. Not to define some kind of social pecking order.I also have an issue with your definition of \textbf{sexism} at 0:56. Seeing as you presented it as, "Is this \textbf{sexism}... against men?" like it was some kind of new concept, is already sending up warning flags."-it's about shaming, belittling, and devaluing the feminine"The definition of \textbf{sexism} is: "\textbf{Sexism} or \textbf{Gender} discrimination is prejudice or discrimination based on a persons \textbf{sex}, or \textbf{gender}."\textbf{Sexism} doesn't have a connection to masculinity or femininity.Moving on to 1:10. "Notice that most of the pressures that boys face, come down to defining them selves against women"That is a blanket statement, and an inaccurate one. While it's true that some social norms came about because of the means she stated, (Throw like a girl, etc) the vast majority of \textbf{Gender} Roles popped up because that's just what each \textbf{gender} did for a long time. Men went out and fought and hunted, and women stayed at home, cooked and nursed children. That's just how it was for a majority of human history.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I think one issue that you neglect to address is the fact that its not always circled back around to the plight of the demeaned female, as you tried to infer in your analysis of male social pressures. \textbf{Gender} specific roles, as you say, for men are not always as positive as some convey. They posses a great deal of pressure. The reason many of the examples that you gave, such as: strength, height, money, and being tough, exist in male social culture is that it stems strongly from the fact that girls TEND TO like those attributes and TEND TO weed out the men that don't have those attributes as un-attractive. This is natural and I believe it's completely reasonable for reasons of strengthening strong genetics. As everyone else does, men care if they are attractive; instead of make-up we have sports in, which any person, partaking in one, has to physically suffer. I'm for equality; although as a guy, I feel that people think that \textbf{sexism} towards men doesn't exist in media and social environment even thought it does. On top of that, any time \textbf{sexism} towards men is pointed out, people belittle it by saying it compares \textbf{nothing} to the plight of women.

I sincerely don't understand why people think it's a problem that some men don't like being called women. There's \textbf{nothing} wrong with wanting to identify as a masculine male. The only problem that I see is women like Laci who preach the lie of "Men just need to act like women and all their problems will go away."The problems that men face are disproportionally high suicide rates, 60 longer prison sentences, unequal rulings in child custody cases, unfair alimony and child support laws, things of actual importance. Feminist don't cause all the problems for men, but as this video did a fantastic job of showing, a lot of feminist push the idea that it's not okay or normal for men to be expected to be men. You demonize men for expecting men to demonstrate traditional male qualities, and by proxy those qualities are looked down upon, leading a lot of men who are biologically inclined to have those qualities to feel demonized for just being men by overbearing feminist.If you want to pretend that feminism cares about men's issues, please call for actual law that extends the prison sentences of women to the full duration of a male's prison sentence for the same crime. When feminist as a group can show that they are willing to deal with all aspects of being "equal" both legally and socially to men, I'll believe them.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!27}1/272 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.368 \\  \hline

I'm sure there are good critiques, too, but sometimes its hard to remember those in the middle of all the vitriol, you know? As far as the limits of mainstream feminism, I'm not exactly sure what you mean. I don't have any evidence beyond the anecdotal to back this up, but in my experience (which, like I said, may differ substantially from yours or anyone else's) feminists are more accepting of men stepping out of \textbf{gender} roles than people who don't identify as feminists. I think that benefits men. Probably my favorite example of feminism working for men is the Womens' rights project of the ACLU.  [LINK]  I'm sorry, I know it's really small and hard to read. But just a couple of examples:Under 1975, click the little circle. Ruth Bader Ginsberg argued that it's unfair for widows to be granted automatic benefits while widowers are not. That had no direct or obvious benefit for women--however, we hope it would help to loosen the idea that women are always dependent on a spouse while men are always the providers.Under 1998, first little bubble, the womens' rights project co-authors the amicus brief in a case where a male was sexually harassed and assaulted by other male co-workers, again having little obvious and direct benefit to a \textbf{woman} in that case--especially since \textbf{sexual} harassment is, correct me if I'm wrong, least likely to be perpetrated by a \textbf{woman} to another \textbf{woman}.There's a couple of others in there, too, if you wanna go through the whole thing. Maybe you don't consider that recent enough to be part of the "current" feminism, but I feel like current feminism isn't really limited, even if mens' rights aren't generally our main focus.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender, Sexual, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}5/343 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.458 \\  \hline

Women lose their husbands, their fathers, their sons in combat. Women often have to flee from the only homes they have ever known.

I am not saying feminists are always correct. And personally I wouldn't care if a man wearing makeup asked me out; as long as it wasn't too much.

It's also based on false assumption, given that the reason custody goes to the mothers most of the time is because the couple decides, by themselves, to do that.If we look at the couples who have to resort to a family court deciding for them, we'd see that over 50 of fathers do get custody (shared or sole). [LINK] There are three reasons why women are favored by family courts:1) Mothers tend to stray at home and take care of the kids; fathers tend not to. Family courts tend to favor the parent that took care of the kid the most, because that's what's more beneficial for the kid.2) A good chunk of divorces that have to be resolved by a family court are due to domestic violence. And male perpetrators are more prevalent.3) There also is a bias in favor of women in courtrooms (lesser sentences, etc.). Thing is, it's due to male paternalism; in practice, judges treat women like children, and believe they don't have as much responsibility as men, so they give them lesser sentences. Schanzenbach also found out that the lesser the \textbf{gender} gap in a district's judge population, the smaller the sentencing gap; in short, female judges don't give unfair advantages to female culprits, male judges do.

Not because women feared they could lose the right to vote, but because they didn't want to be treated like, I quote, "second class citizens".Before the decision about not reinstating the draft came about, the Supreme Court already decided on the "Should women be included in the draft?" question.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Dario Carraresi In fact, lets take a closer look at one of the sites you just used: [LINK] The first point made: "In 2013, among full-time, year-round workers, women were paid 78 percent of what men were paid."No data, no specifications, no explanations. Do you know how they actually got to these figures? They took figures of full-time working men, compared them to full-time working women, and discovered the total amount earned by women was 78 of the amount of the men. What they however did not take into account was time off, sick leave, overtime, etc. A paycheck for a \textbf{woman} doing the same thing as a man is exactly the same for the same amount of hours.Point two made: "The best place in the United States for pay equity is Washington, D.C., where women were paid 91 percent of what men were paid in 2013. At the other end of the spectrum is Louisiana, the worst state in the country for pay equity, where women were paid just 66 percent of what men were paid."Again, no mention of any data, circumstances, whatever. I could look into this, but I'm sure women are more likely to be housewives in the back country then in the nations capital. These are probably career women, whom on average work nearly as much as men, thus earning nearly the same on a yearly overall basis.Point three made: "The \textbf{gender} pay gap affects all women, but for women of color the pay shortfall is worse. Hispanic women's salaries show the largest gap, at 54 percent of white men's earnings. \textbf{Black} women's salaries stand at 64 percent of white men's earnings. White men are used as a benchmark because they make up the largest demographic group in the labor force."I'd like to see how they figured this out. Are we talking about a white man and a \textbf{black} \textbf{woman} doing the exact same job for the exact same amount of hours? Or are we - what I'm suspecting - talking about a burger flipping \textbf{black} \textbf{woman} to the engineer white man? Yeah, no wonder she earns less! Again; Not taking into account time off, sick leave, overtime or anything.Point four made: "From elementary and middle school teachers to computer programmers, women are paid less than men in female-dominated, \textbf{gender}-balanced, and male-dominated occupations."Yes; Because women on average work less hours a year. Again; I dare any \textbf{woman} to show me a paycheck of her and a man doing the same job for the same hours, and show me she got less money. I dare themPoint five made: "Women typically earn about 90 percent of what men are paid until they hit 35. After that median earnings for women are typically 75–80 percent of what men are paid."Notice the word 'median' here. And we already saw at the top of the article they are talking about full-time male and female workers. No mention of any kind of additional data or explanations of this 'fact'. They looked at the financial data of men and women over a full year, took the average of these numbers, compared them, and cried wolf.Point six made: "At every level of academic achievement, women's median earnings are less than men's earnings, and in some cases, the \textbf{gender} pay gap is larger at higher levels of education. While education helps everyone, \textbf{black} and Hispanic women earn less than their white and Asian peers do, even when they have the same educational credentials."More stupidly interpreted data. In fact there are other studies that do take into account all the details show that women make more then men, for the same amount of work.Point seven made: "AAUW's Graduating to a Pay Gap found that among full-time workers one year after college graduation — nearly all of whom were childless — women were paid just 82 percent of what their male counterparts were paid."What they were paid, or what they earned? Did they even have the same kind of job? Again, no clear answers here.None of what is said here proves anything, it's all conformation bias.

It's basically forced conscription. Who in the right mind wants to be apart of it? God you are \textbf{dumb} as fuck. 2. If women were to be drafted that means women the same \textbf{age} as male drafting \textbf{age} (18 I believe) would be sent into combat. That means most women would be sent off to war while the very young and very \textbf{old} stay behind to tend to family duties, and or Work for their families. 3. If we send these women out there is no guarantee that most will come back alive. In the event that few come back, who is left to repopulate when most women were sent off to war and most died along with the men? Extreme measures would be taken and teenagers would have to repopulate or remaining women and men have to repopulate. Exceptions though to avoiding a draft is being the last family member. 4. Again I say. Why the fuck would you want to be in a draft? War is fucked up and horrible and no person should have to experience it. 5. Learn what Drafting is.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Robin Miller The problem is that most of those problems are either issues that don't have as much importance as the female equivalent, or are caused by the same \textbf{sexism} feminists are fighting against.Take the sentencing disparity, for example: turns out male judges give female culprits lesser sentences because they consider them "less rational and responsible and more manipulable" - in other words, they don't treat women as adults with all the attached responsabilities, but as "children", inferior to men.Meanwhile, female judges don't have this problem - and no, they don't favor female culprits because they're women. Nor do they give harsher sentences to men. Female judges give equal sentences to equal culprits.The findings regarding \textbf{gender} in the case of serious offenses are quite striking: the greater the proportion of female judges in a district, the lower the \textbf{gender} disparity for that district.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Dario Carraresi While i really wish what you were saying was true, I have not found that to be the case! When you talk to people about domestic violence for example 'its never ever ok for a man to hit a \textbf{woman}'... but when asked and its most women who respond with this question, about women hitting men, most women are very quick to ask 'well what did he do to deserve it?' You can see the very core of the bias in the question itself! Somehow a man can do something to deserve getting slapped by a \textbf{woman} but a \textbf{woman} can never do anything that deserves a man to slap her!Feminism has only advocated for lower sentencing for women, NEVER have I seen feminism advocating for lower sentences for men who commit the exact same crime! I have never seen a ratio where female judges all hand out equal sentences to women and men for the same crime... its the same bias and while there may be some judges who do not adhere to this, its still the overwhelming majority of all judges of both sexes who continue this disparity!If Feminism was about fender equality then the universal domestic abuse symbol would not be a man attacking a \textbf{woman}, it would be two figures who were \textbf{gender} neutral in that depiction! And yes, whenever men start talking about the issues we face that are overwhelming problems for men compared to women, we are belittled, brushed aside and laughed at! Its even popular for sexist objects like a mug that says 'male tears' to propagate around feminists rhetoric.If women really want to be treated as equals to men, why do feminists only fight for more reproductive rights for women and never for men?After \textbf{sex}, a \textbf{woman} has many option not to be a mother... so why does the father have no say? Saying that if a man does not want to be a father then he should just 'keep it in his pants' is incredibly sexist... its as bad as saying that 'if a \textbf{woman} does not want to be a mother then she should keep her legs closed'... its a straw man distraction!The problem with this is that it is all about accountability of the male without rights, choices and decision making options. It is a little like taxation without representation. I think this is outdated thinking for two reasons:(a) first of all, men should have equal reproductive rights to women. They don't. Their accountability should be in proportion to their rights. Also men should have equal reproductive options to women. They don't and probably never will. Hence their accountability needs to go had in hand with an explicit consent and decision. I don't think it is valid in the western world to to say \textbf{sex} = consent to have a baby. That ignores modern day realities and ultimately leads to a host of negative outcomes for children. (b) it is plain barbaric to remove the parenting bond and parenting decisions from a father for no good reason and then also force him to pay for that 'privilege'. What is really occurring is not that the male is being made accountable for his sperm - it is that the male is been made accountable for other's parenting decisions that he very strongly objects to. It simply does not wash that the male is an automatically walking wallet even when the children have been removed from him against his will - simply because he had \textbf{sex}. It has also been a disaster for children and society. In the end these polices have been a failure and they encourage fatherlessness. In addition a growing number of the most responsible and valuable potential fathers are simply opting out altogether.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Dario Carraresi "Am I wrong, or it was mysoginists who forbad women into joining the army because "Women are weaker than men, we don't want weak soldiers"?"You are wrong. Women didn't fight in wars because women's reproductive capabilities were far important than men's. One man can procreate with 1000 women and make 1000 babies. Oh, and combine that with how women have demonstrably weaker upper body strength on average then men, and consider that prior to the modern \textbf{age} of guns, upper body strength was pretty important part of war considering you were swinging a heavy piece of steel around, I'd say it's pretty obvious why women weren't a part of wars or even wanted in war."Isn't the life gap due to natural biology? We research ways to improve the quality of life and extend the lifespan. What can we do more?"Natural biology developed from male disposability."Feminists are against any unwanted genital mutilation. And honestly, female genital mutilations have MUCH higher damages and risks connetted to it than circumcision."Yes, they are against it in much the same way they're against running \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} lights. They think it's wrong but it's very far from the topic of conversation despite how real the problem is. Also, FGM is actively banned in a lot of the modern world, yet is somehow more important. Go figure, guess it's that male privilege."The laws is \textbf{gender}-neutral."All laws are \textbf{gender} neutral. Does that mean that women are completely equal to men legally by your own admission?"There are.  [LINK] From their website: "Our mission is to help men who have had unwanted or abusive \textbf{sexual} experiences in childhood live healthier, happier lives."Sounds just like a domestic violence shelter to me."What does his wallet has to do with her riproductive rights? You know what would be really cheap? Condoms, and maybe the "day-later" pill (or however it's called in the USA)."His wallet goes to fund the kids he doesn't want and has no choice but to pay for because the state legally requires him to pay child support and can ruin his entire life through criminal charges and prison time if he doesn't pay. If condoms worked 100 of the time, and women were 100 truthful about taking the "day-later" pill, your argument would have some merit."There are no specific laws, but in cases where the \textbf{woman} was at fault, courts either accused her of fraud, or applied the "intentional misinterpretation" \textbf{common} law."Can you list these cases? Estimate for me, what percentage of paternal fraud actually ends with any semblance of punishment for the \textbf{woman}?"And rape jokes are seen as funny, and women who consider them offensive are declared hysterical bitches."That's because no one on earth finds rape jokes (outside of male on male rape) funny, and the hysterical bitches who keep bringing it up can literally not even provide one example of a rape joke that wasn't publicly decried for being a rape joke (again, unless it's male on male)."If you're referring to false rape accusations, they're somewhere between 2 and 0,7 of all rape incidents. For comparison: false auto theft accusations are 2,6 of the total."You just linked two completely non-official websites to cite your statistics. That's beside the point though. False rape accusations DEVASTATE the accused on every aspect of life. People will consider him a rapist even if he never goes to trial. Even 2 of rape accusations being false (it's much higher than that, mind you, as you feminist love to point out, most rape accusations are never acted on by police because there's not enough substantiated evidence, and that's primarily because a lot of them as BS) are unacceptable levels due to how damning a rape accusation is in this country. That's like being okay knowing that 2 of convicted murderers are innocent men spending their whole life in prison, and saying "oh well, \textbf{nothing} we can do"."Again, the laws are \textbf{gender} neutral."Again, admitting that women are completely equal in the eyes of law are not oppressed."The leading cause for suicide is clinical depression. There is no sizable amount of males committing suicide due to them being discriminated for being male. While there are sizable amounts of females, homosexuals, and transgenders who commit suicide due to the discrimination they faced."Men kill themselves because our society paints being male as a bad thing, and the system actively takes advantage of the vulnerable legal state that men are in. For example, when your wife cheats on you out of the blue and then takes your house and your kids and gets alimony because you make more than her (because you work 50+ hours a week while she stays at home mind you). There's no way for most men to come out on top if a \textbf{woman} decides to fuck with his life, it has extremely lasting effects both financially and emotionally. Meanwhile, while a lot of men are already down trodden because they're giving 1/3 of their money to their ex wife to pay for kids he doesn't get to see, he's got transgenders, homosexuals, and females all calling him the devil and painting him out to be the worst thing in existence for oppressing them.But no, you're right, men as a group don't have any problems, they just love killing themselves in gross disproportion to other groups for no fucking reason what so ever."The vast majority of workers who work in jobs that pose serious health risks are male."Well, I've got some semblance of hope then that you won't bring up the false wage gap.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Common, Gender, Nothing, Red, Sexual, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Age - General, Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Native-American, Gender - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}11/944 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.165 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Robin Miller First: have you proven that the article I've posted reports false or biased information? Have you proven that the sources used in those links are false or biased? No. Therefore, your accusations of bias is completely baseless and \textbf{fruit} of prejudice.Second: what Jezebel link?Third: here, have some more actual facts that debunk even more of what RealSexism said.4) Workplace DeathsUh, go figure. The source RS used in this point is Alas! A Blog. A feminist blog. Strange, considering the bias contempt RS has for feminism.But anyway, first of all: men don't die in workplace because of women. Men die in workplace mostly because of negligence - specifically, the negligence of employers in guaranteeing basic safety protocols. [LINK] In fact, look at the most affected categories:- Temporary workers;- Immigrants;- Young people.Notice anything? These are all vulnerable categories thanks to both their necessity to have a job, any job - which leads them to take unsafe jobs - and their inexperience in working. Basically, they take those jobs because they have no choice, and the employers for those jobs take advantage of these vulnerable workers to get low-pay employees.More importantly, those employers cut the costs for safety regulations and training. They're literally sending those workers in potentially dangerous jobs without training them about the dangers, because it's a cost. And the States allow it: the fines OSHA applies for a "serious" violation of safety regulations are 1.700\$ on average - and the maximum fine is only 7.000\$. Which is absolutely not enough deterrent for those employers to pay for the safety measures.And, just to top it off, the workers who are most affected by safety hazards are the ones who have the least amount of chances to speak up, given that they risk to lose their jobs and probable only source of income. Another reason is "occupational segregation": basically, all those beliefs and behaviors that relegate men to "male" jobs, and women to "female" jobs. This can both be external - like managers hiring less men/women for a particular job because "men/women are bad at this job", regardless of the actual capacities of the applicant; or straight-up harassment - and internal: men tend to feel uncomfortable entering a "female" job, and vice-versa.But it's clear that it's not a 50/50 issue. Both because women were legally forbidden from taking most jobs, and because of a \textbf{gender} pay gap forming in women-dominated jobs - administrative assistants, nurses, teachers, baby-sitters - at the expense of women. [LINK]  I've already talked about war casualties back in point (1) (almost all of the military is made of men, while it hasn't been proven any bias in civilian casualties), so: 5) Child Custody.The statistic is true only if you consider all divorces - both those that are pacifically decided by both parents, and those where there isn't an arrangement, so a family court is called to decide. [LINK] So, the vast majority of divorcing couples reach a \textbf{common} decision without involving a family court. And when I say vast, I mean VAST - 91 of divorces. 63 decide on giving child custody solely on the mothers, 6 solely on the fathers, 25 decide for shared custody, and the remaining 6 is listed as "other". As I've said, I'm talking about peaceful and mutual decisions within the couple.So, let's look at the remaining part of divorces: out of 100 divorces, 5 are resolved right after the family court evaluates the couple for the first time; 2,5 enter a litigation trial, but then fall back on the court's initial decision; and 1,5 enter a litigation trial and go all the way through. So, what are the results of this 9 of divorces?Sole possession, mother: 44Sole possession, father: 11Shared possession: 40Other: 5So, about "men being allowed to see their children": the minimum percentage is the sum of "sole custody to father" and "shared custody". When the couple decides by itself, the "chance" for fathers to see the kids (and I'm using the term loosely, because, as I've said, I'm talking about a mutual decision from the couple's part ) is 31. But when we consider family courts, and we considers the cases where the parents are actually fighting each other for child custody, the "victory chance" for fathers is 51.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Brian McCann Sweet so here is what im talking about. 1) I think the wage gap is exaggerated and doesn't account for other variables on top of that there is already a law that says you can't discriminate based on \textbf{gender} so I don't think we can't start there. 2) I see no reason why women shouldn't get guaranteed maternity leave forming life is a big deal, so that is one thing. 3) Like I stated before a child in the womb is a human life thus murder if aborted so I don't think we can start there. 4) I'm all for \textbf{sex} education I don't want any talk about so called "toxic masculinity" or the extreme feminist definition of "rape culture". So there you have it at least one and half issues we can have \textbf{common} ground I don't expect you to fight for every issue that effects men, cause we probably don't agree all that much.

How is someone going to give citation for feminist = Nazis, cause it's not literal but there are extreme elements. Feminist are the ones shutting down free speech on college campuses feminist advocate government force to impose "social justice" many feminist have written books and articles demonizing men ( i.e all men are rapist) just how the Nazis demonized Jews before they rounded them up. Its not that the feminist hold up swastikas but there are sentiments that come across VERY VERY anti male and you wonder why some men in the middle don't call themselves feminist even though you claim to help men. Thats like saying Republicans have the best ideas to help impoverished blacks so why don't more \textbf{black} people vote Republican (cause maybe they do have better ideas) but they are horrible at messaging and branded \textbf{racist} on the other side. So yeah I am just saying a lot of things on the feminist tracks hit men as not dealing with there issues and being in fact anti male. Now that might be true or might not be, I personally see the feminist mantra for the most part being anti male.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Travis Jones So, I've just begun fact-checking the quote list you gave me, and I have to say: it's not good. There's a LOT of quotes, but barely any reference to what source they were taken from (and this is a proble - see below); it reeks of what I call "feminist hive mind", aka the idea that all feminists 100 agree with the ideas of all feminists. Which is like saying that someone who votes Republican agrees 100 with both the "Republican Majority for Choice" and, say, Pat Robertson.Also, most quotes are at least 40 years \textbf{old}. It would've helped if the people who made the list brought some more recent example, or examples of modern-day feminists using those same arguments.A LOT of quotes are against "marriage"; bear in mind however that we're talking about the '70s, when the issue were that the wife was required to stay at home to take care of the kids (and thus forgo any opportunity to work), and to obey the husband in all things. "Marital rape" (basically, the idea that a wife can refuse to have \textbf{sex} with her husband, despite the \textbf{fat} that she vowed to "obey" him) was barely brought up as a concept during that time. The Linda Gordon quote is such an example: No \textbf{woman} should have to deny herself any opportunities because of her special responsibilities to her children. ... Families will be finally destroyed only when a revolutionary social and economic organization permits people's needs for love and security to be met in ways that do not impose divisions of labor, or any external roles, at all.The bolded part was cut out from the list.Next, we have Robin Morgan. The first quote references "class-hatred", which was essentially protests on-par with the vast majority of the leftist movements at the time. That was it. No physical violence, no assault on the White House, \textbf{nothing}.The second quote ("I haven't the faintest notion what possible revolutionary role white hetero- \textbf{sexual} men could fulfill...") even without the context, looks completely sardonic. Not serious.The third was, IN FULL: "All the discriminatory practices against women are patterned and rationalized by this slavery-like practice. We can't destroy the inequities between men and women until we destroy marriage", referencing the marriage contract laws at the time. I remind you: marital rape wasn't even thought at the time. It was just assumed that, since traditional marriages required the \textbf{woman} "to obey", it was to be followed literally.The fourth is an example of affirmative consent, which, again, wasn't even thought by men at the time.Quotes 5-9 have been taken from "The Demon Lover". Subtitle: "The Roots of Terrorism", specifically from the West bank and the Gaza strip. I'm facepalming right now.Quote 10 is taken from a speech about how men don't experience sexist oppression. They have disadvantaged caused by sexist beliefs (ex.: "boys don't cry", or "men are always willing to have \textbf{sex} with a beautiful \textbf{woman}"), but they can't be oppressed by \textbf{sexism} in the same way white Americans aren't oppressed by \textbf{racism}. Men are teached to conform to toxic ideals of "masculinity" and shamed if they don't (just look at how male feminists are instantly called "manginas" or "white kinghts§" on the web); but the fact remains that men are in a position of power, and that the bulk of discrimination by \textbf{gender} comes from men.In the long run, Women's Liberation will of course free men - but in the short run it's going to cost men a lot of privilege, which no one gives up willingly or easily.[§: Because the only reason a man (and not a \textbf{tranny}, a \textbf{faggot}, or a mangina, which aren't REAL men) would EVER help a \textbf{woman} is to get \textbf{sex}, amirite? </sarcasm>]Then there's Solanas and the SCUM manifesto (not society, given that the group was never formed), which is brought up a lot, despite the fact that not only the vast majority of feminists today regard it as bad taste satire at best and as an apology for violence at worst (not to mention that it presented a situation where "liberated" women had to literally fight against "brainwashed" women); but even back then when it was published, the reception has been lukewarm at best - and pretty much no-one treated it as an how-to manual for building a feminist society. [LINK] Then I skipped a bit to see if Andrea Dworkin was cited - and sure it was. Now, remember what I said about not citing the sources? This is the most evident one. Dworkin published a fictional novel - Mercy: A Novel - where the main character is repeatedly raped throughout her life. Nowhere in that list is noted which quotes are from Dworkin's politial statements, and which are from her fiction novel. And that's quite the mislead. Here's where those quotes came from:1: From Ice and Fire, Dworkin's first fictional novel.2: Another attack on the institution of marriage (albeit an extreme one, but remember the bit I've said about marital rape).3: Misquoted. The actual quote was ""Intercourse is the pure, sterile, formal expression of men's contempt for women". Probably referring to marital intercourse, given that adultery was frowned upon (and almost always blamed on the \textbf{woman}). [LINK] 4: True, but I fail to see how that's a problem. Asexuality is a thing.5: True, and albeit the "inevitable" part is extreme, the bulk of the quote is not. Again: it's a denounce of the idea of marriage as "the \textbf{woman} as property of the man".6: True, both in terms of "Is this an actual quote from Dworkin?", and of "Is this actually true?". People of both \textbf{gender} can be raped, since rape is not a matter of \textbf{sexual} desire but a matter of power; but the overwhelming majority of rapes are against women.7: True, but given the context of her other quotes, it's easy to believe she meant hostile to the sexist system that placed men on the top.8: True and written as a "Take Back The Night" speech - against the idea that it was up to women to "not let themselves being raped" by going out at night (like men could), drinking \textbf{alcohol} (like men could), etc. It was a speech against victim-blaming. [LINK] 9: Cannot be traced back to Dworkin. There's a lot of works quoting that quote, all bashing feminism, but I can't find the original source where that quote is supposedly taken from.10: Comes from Letters Form A War Zone, where Dworkin heavily criticizes the beliefs of male supremacists like Edward O. Wilson, at one point comparing those beliefs to Hitler's. So these are not Dworkin's beliefs.11 + 12: Taken from an opera that talks about the pornography's industry at the time - which was rife with \textbf{sexual} slavery - and in particular attacks non-con porn, where the \textbf{woman} is "raped" because she "tempted" the rapist. [LINK] That doesn't look so good thus far. And then I've realized that this list isn't even a new thing.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small +Dario Carraresi Because freedom of choice totally doesn't exist! Now this 3rd wave feminist movement is becoming even more incomprehensible. [LINK] This was an awful article to read. Now tell me why this research has a major flaw? The amount of male to female ratio in those job occupations aren't stated in that article. You can't even call that accurate, that's just awful researching. Basically, I can do the same type of research to a male working as a nurse in a hospital, and that is a female dominated job as opposed to males. Result? You'll see males being paid less ON AVERAGE because less men work as nurses as opposed to women. Compare that to higher paying jobs that men often occupy more than women based on INTEREST, not the favoritism of \textbf{patriarchy}. Women make different choices when choosing a job as opposed to men, hell, more women are entering occupations that have been male dominated for years.Times are changing. This article failed to prove anything. The \textbf{gender} wage gap is a debunked myth. Tell me an instance in which you had an employer paying a \textbf{woman} less than a men working full time unless you take a raise as a factor.The 77 cents to a mans dollar was basically a sum of men and women working full-time jobs averaged throughout the U.S. and excluding part time jobs.  Not once, does it say that women are being paid less in their job counterparts as opposed to men merely for \textbf{gender} and that is illegal. Women make different choices than men. Call me sexist for listing out facts, but \textbf{gender} roles do exist. Maternal leave can influence that pay gap and isn't necessarily a positive thing,, women can arguably go on longer vacations, but you don't see any major \textbf{sexism} taking place in Canada, Western Europe, or the U.S. While maternal leave is pushed on the Mother as a \textbf{gender} role issue and the majority of males don't suffer from the loss of having to work or getting denied the opportunity to be promoted, each individuals are supporting themselves as a married couple rather than blatant and inherent \textbf{sexism}. Alimony may be a part of the reason why some females are not striving as economically as men, but you're not taking responsibility as a factor. While it's possible that the male is contributing his some funds towards child support after divorce, it may be more hard for a \textbf{woman} to earn her living while also taking care of her children (This I can comply with as a hard issue) While equalizing work between the two may seem beneficial to "equality", you also have circumstances. I have no problems with this actually. However biologically, females have always been maternal by nature, and contribute breastfeeding towards their newborns as a fact. You can't deny this. If you're unsatisfied with having to do so, then don't have children. Obviously that's not going to happen, but take that into consideration. While men are to taught to be tough in nature, can you do the same for women? Can you make them work life risking jobs compared to men who have a higher death ratio as opposed to women? Those life-risking jobs require extensive labor, and males are more physically stronger than females.  If you want the Wage gap to be more equalized, tell women to stop having children (Obviously won't happen) so that they won't have to suffer from maternal leave and parental issues while focusing on work. But still, the statistics from that website are awful and don't account the human resources factor.  [LINK] Another awful article to read. Why? While this is orientated towards Stem/Cell research based on what men "stereotypically" think of women on a computer generated model of questioning with BIAS. With 150 participants and no stratification of any sort of college degree among these applicants, shows to tell me that this research is automatically flawed for not giving me a full picture. Now tell me the issue on why this was also awful like the first one? First, this article should have showed models of \textbf{gender} bias,  male to female ratio on women graduating with degrees in correlation with stem, engineering, etc., and FREEDOM OF CHOICE. Based on what i've seen in this article, does not correlate with the majority of Stem research if we were to base it off this study that didn't even take a significant amount of time. Obviously, freedom of choice doesn't exist with third wave feminists, so I beg to differ. Compare it with this article. [LINK] Result? She's discouraged by the fact that women aren't entering fields such as computer sciences, mathematics, and Stem research, yet she claims that there is a growth of more women entering the field. Now what does that say to you? Even if more women are being convinced towards joining stem research, there still hasn't been an influx of women entering these fields. Why? It's not because they're oppressed, it's because that women in general aren't interested in those fields as compared to men, unless you can prove otherwise. However, this claim itself is a fallacy if I go alone with what she said, because she hasn't provided me any models to convince me otherwise with her claim based on one "study". Her claim is flawed and wrong unless proven otherwise.She later states that Harvey Mudd's model may not translate as well in comparison for other colleges and even considers itself a liberal arts school. She's not even supporting her own claim at this point. Freedom of choice doesn't exist with most 3rd wave feminists. EVERYTHING HAS TO BE ABSOLUTELY EQUAL! Sorry, but equality equates to freedom of choice. I'm sure you're willing to agree with that, because \textbf{gender} roles DO EXIST. Even if you dislike it. However, good news for you! Give it time, and things will eventually change at this rate! We are seeing an influx of women graduating with higher grades than men. This is Harvey Mudd's model.  [LINK] While these statistics do prove convincing, it still doesn't tell me the specific amount of students entering those fields as a whole. However, it can provide me with a thesis tell me that freedom of choice is prevalent and that women are more interested in social sciences, psychology, and biological sciences, etc. It's a good starting point for an argument, however more comparisons are needed. Dario, your arguments are still weak at parts because they also don't provide circumstances and certain factors. I believe you can do better at citing more resources that have actually been researched with time and preparation, along with factors. It's actually really hard to find research that hasn't been skewered into one's favor and hasn't been a subject to bias. While you did point out cite the alimony source (Which was interesting and thought provoking;albeit it was a blog, not journalism) I can see where you're coming from on specific issues. But likewise, it's the freedom of choice that dictates us in everything, \textbf{gender} roles or not.I can agree and comply that you're more intellectually driven at points than most wannabe feminists and you actually have good arguments, but this third wave of feminism as a majority isn't even needed because they are taking issues towards the wrong places that don't even enforce \textbf{sexism}. They're making this into a public gathering of support from people who don't play games. They're publicizing this issue beyond belief.  You're a real feminist by my definition, but we can agree to disagree at some points. That's natural. Look up shirtgate, and gamergate as an example. There's a lot more examples, but that's where feminism isn't needed. Eventually, gaming will endorse more female gamers. However, feminists like Anita Sarkeesian are rigging their whole support from people who don't even play games at all and as a result gain popularity from bloggers who can't even research, along with liberal media outlets that label games as sexist, when in actuality they are not. We need more thought provoking feminists (Like you) than the ones that cry \textbf{sexism} over every single fucking issue.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender, Patriarchy, Sexism, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}14/1356 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.032 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Ryan Billybob 1) Because freedom of choice totally doesn't exist!Premise: if you believe that women stay at home because "choice", and not because they're pressured to stay at home and take care of the kids because "that's the mother's role"... Why would you whine about child custody?Child custody is awarded to the "primary care-giver", aka parent that took care of the kid the most - almost always, the parent who stayed at home and took care of the kids.If you claim that the vast majority of women stay at home and take care of the kids - aka being the "primary care-giver" because "choice", you're also claiming that men refuse to be the "primary care-giver" because "choice". In other words: according to you, there is no disparity in child custody, because men choosed to simply not have it.The same goes for workplace deaths. Men "choose" to go in those dangerous jobs. Women "choosed" not to. So stop whining about how more men die in workplaces. According to you, it was their "choice".2) Now, let's move on to the Yale study.> This was an awful article to read. Now tell me why this research has a major flaw? The amount of male to female ratio in those job occupations aren't stated in that article.That's not the point of the study. The point of the study is to show that women are:- hired less often in those faculties;- offered a lot less money (-4.000\$, on average);- that, in comparison to male applications that have the exact same copy-pasted references and qualifications.Now answer me: how the "male to female ratio in those jobs occupations" justifies offering X in yearly wage to a male applicant with Y qualifications, and (X minus 4.000\$) in yearly wage to a female applicant with the exact same Y qualifications? Here's a hint: it doesn't.> Basically, I can do the same type of research to a male working as a nurse in a hospital, and that is a female dominated job as opposed to males. Result? You'll see males being paid less ON AVERAGE because less men work as nurses as opposed to women.First: that makes no sense. Why would being underrepresented in a workplace means that you're paid less? Unless you're confusing "average" with "total".10 women working for wage A -> total pay: (A + A + A + A + A + A + A + A + A + A) = 10A -> average pay, (10A)  10 = A2 men working for wage A -> total pay: (A * A) = 2A -> average pay: (2A)  2 = ASee? The average wages stay the same.Second: your assumption is false. There are less men in nursing that women, but now that they're sizable, a \textbf{gender} gap has started to form. In favor of men. [LINK] In babysitting, too. [LINK] Or how about something different? Let's look at \textbf{doctors}. \textbf{Doctors} are a highly paid specialization, right? They ought to be paid more than many other jobs, rights? So how come that Russian \textbf{doctors} are one of the lowest paid professions in Russia, despite Russian \textbf{doctors} requiring the same level of preparation as American ones? *Maybe because, unlike other countries, Russian \textbf{doctors} are mostly women? Maybe because any profession that is considered "feminine" is automatically devauled because feeeeeeeeemale? [LINK] 3) > The \textbf{gender} wage gap is a debunked myth. Tell me an instance in which you had an employer paying a \textbf{woman} less than a men working full time unless you take a raise as a factor.Even taking away ALL possible other factors - different jobs, different positions, different chances to be hired, women being the "primary care-giver" and staying at home, different chances to be promoted/having a raise, different working hours - there's STILL a 7 difference that cannot be explained away. [LINK] And I've already shown you how there are massive bias regirding hiring, wage offered, and promotions/raises offered. The Yale university study is one. The Columbia Business School one below is another.> Call me sexist for listing out facts, but \textbf{gender} roles do exist.Yes, but they're social. Not biological. If you argue that \textbf{gender} roles are biological, you have to argue that:- Men have to work in dangerous jobs in place of women, ergo you can't cmplain about workplace deaths differences;- Men have to be soldiers, ergo stop complaining about the draft;- The mother's role is to stay at home and taking care of the kids. That's not the father's role; ergo, you can't complain when child custody is given to mothers;- Men are naturally more physically strong than women, ergo stop complaining when "a man hits a \textbf{woman}" is treated differently that "a \textbf{woman} hits a man" - by your logic, the damage a man and a \textbf{woman} can do are not comparable.And so on.4) Alimony may be a part of the reason why some females are not striving as economically as men,No. Alimony isn't given to women; it's given to the spouse who stays at home. Why? Because someone who stays at home to take care of the house and the kids CANNOT pursue a full-time high-pay carreer. It's pretty much impossible.Alimony rebalances the economic differences between the stay-at-home spouse and the bread-winner one. Because otherwise, that stay-at-home spouse would never be able to leave the bread-winner spouse and survive economically on their own - plus, the former has sacrificed their chances at having a remunerative career. [LINK] Also: you're still defending \textbf{gender} roles. Go up to point (1) and (3) to see why that would force you to shut up about child custody, the draft...> However biologically, females have always been maternal by nature, and contribute breastfeeding towards their newborns as a fact. You can't deny this.Ever heard of baby formulas, bucko? What do you think women who cannot lactate enough do?Also: if women are maternal because "biology", then please explain the existance of feminism. Because, if it's that strong of a biological directive, how come we're able to rebel to it?> While men are to taught to be tough in nature, can you do the same for women?Yes.> Can you make them work life risking jobs compared to men who have a higher death ratio as opposed to women?Yes. In fact, many women do. That includes sewer work and mining.> Those life-risking jobs require extensive labor, and males are more physically stronger than females.And? Just allow only the people who have the physical requiremens for the job. And if you argue "But women cannot do those jobs because the're weeeeeeeeak!", then stop whining about men dying in workplaces.> If you want the Wage gap to be more equalized, tell women to stop having children (Obviously won't happen) so that they won't have to suffer from maternal leave and parental issues while focusing on work.You're confounding "pregnancy leave" with "maternity leave". The first is actually a biological issue; the second is a matter of who stays at home and takes care of the babies. Surely men can do that, can0t they?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Ryan Billybob 5) Let's move on to your opinions on the Columbia Business School study. [LINK] > Another awful article to read. Why? While this is orientated towards Stem/Cell research based on what men "stereotypically" think of women on a computer generated model of questioning with BIAS.And that right there proves that you didn't bother to read the article at all. STEM refers to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. Moreover, it isn't a study to show that women don't choose to go in STEM faculties and workplaes; it's a study to show how women who DO apply for STEM-related workplaces are discriminated. The first version of the experiment went as follows:- 150 "Applicants" took a test to gauge their effectiveness at math - specifically, summing four-digits numbers without mistakes and as quickly as possible. Results showed that men and women were roughly equal.- 200 "hiring managers" underwent a test to gauge how much they adhered to stereotypes about how women are less capable at math than men.- The "managers" were required to choose a candidate between a man and a \textbf{woman}, for the same task (summing numbers), without knowing anything about those candidates besides their \textbf{gender}.- Results of test 1: 2 men hired for each \textbf{woman}. When "mistakes" were made (the less efficent candidate was picked), 90 of the time, it was "less competent man hired over more competent \textbf{woman}". College degrees, past background - all irrilevant because the "managers" couldn't know that information; all they knew was that candidate A was a man and candidate B was a \textbf{woman}.- Version 2: "applicants" were allowed to tell the "managers" about the results of their test. Again, college degrees, backgrounds etc. are irrilevant for the purpose of this test; the "managers" know only the \textbf{gender} and the score of the applicants.- Results of test 2: the hiring bias was diminished, but NOT eliminated. Furthermore, it was shown that those responsible for that bias were those who believed the stereotype "women can't do math" the most. The bulk of the "mistakes" was STILL "less competent man hired over more competent \textbf{woman}".All other objections of yours don't matter; the text excluded the ratio of math degrees because it's irrilevant to the test. The test showed that, when it comes to male and female applicants in math, there's a bias against women. The same goes for pretty much the entirety of STEM. Try and dismiss that.6) ...but this third wave of feminism as a majority isn't even needed because they are taking issues towards the wrong places that don't even enforce \textbf{sexism}.\textbf{Gender} roles ARE \textbf{sexism}. The very idea that a man can't do X or that a \textbf{woman} has to be Y is by itself sexist, because it's complete evopsych bullshit.7) They're making this into a public gathering of support from people who don't play games..........I don't remember talking about women in videogames, but okay, fine, I'll bite.First of all: girls and women play videogames. Deal with it. [LINK] > Eventually, gaming will endorse more female gamers.Just like people of color would've gotten the vote? By magic?> However, feminists like Anita Sarkeesian are rigging their whole support from people who don't even play games at all and as a result gain popularity from bloggers who can't even research, along with liberal media outlets that label games as sexist, when in actuality they are not.First: how do you know that Sarkeesian is getting support from "non-gamers"? Second: why do you care that Sarkeesian is getting financial support from "non" gamers? The only cases where someone would legitimately be against Sarkeesian getting financed are:1) If she feigned the harassment she got, in order to play on the indignation of the masses and scam them of their money. Hint: she didn't. It's impossible for her to feign this much harassment - and that's not counting the harassment other women get online. [LINK] 2) If she didn't deliver what she promised - aka the "Tropes vs Women in Videogames" series - after getting the money. That hypotesis is clearly false.3) If she didn't show any kind of \textbf{sexism} at all in her videos, thus defying the point of her series. She did - you can probably disagree with her on multiple examples, but surely you can't deny that the trends she shows don't exist.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender, Sexism, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}12/734 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.635 \\  \hline

We had the exact same problem with "\textbf{racism}". It's not a really important thing, as long as everyone explains the definition they're using.Also:Feminism: A group that was born to give women the same rights as men; nowadays, a group that tries to make all genders equal.\textbf{Misogynist}: Someone who discriminates against women.The two are clearly incompatible.> Nevertheless, the only right that women lack that men have, in certain states, is being topless. Until you can give me legal rights that women are lacking and men have I'll contuine to be an MRA.Oh, so since there isn't a LAW saying that women shouldn't be hired/promoted/paid as much as men, it means that discrimination in the workplaces doesn't exist? Then explaing the following two studies:- "Hiring managers" were required to hire either a man or a \textbf{woman}. they hired 2 men for every \textbf{woman} - but when they picked the less efficent candidate, 90 of the time they favored the man over the more efficent \textbf{woman}. The bias stood even when the "managers" were allowed to check the applicant's scores and SEE that the \textbf{woman} was more efficent than the man. [LINK] - Applications are sent to various faculties. Each application sent to a specific faculty were WORD-BY-WORD identical, barring the name.

Also: if that was true, then MRAs should drop their "child custody" argument. Child custody is awarded to the primary care-giver, aka the parent who stayed at home and took care of the kids the most. If you defend "biological \textbf{gender} roles", you can't whine that men don't get child custody.Same for alimony.> The problem with child custody is that even when the father was the primer caregiver it's often overlooked and the child is given to the mother.Citation needed.

It's that women get lighter sentences than men. We know that, because the fair judges give to both men and women the same sentences unfair judges give to men only.Also: the unfair judges? Are MEN. The higher the percentage of female judges in any district, the LESSER the sentencing disparity. So much for your "women want to hold all men down" bullshit.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small That's not the definition of feminism, in fact the definition of feminism that is in dictionary is really just based on liberal feminism. The first definition you gave was correct. "A group that was born to gibe women the same rights as men".  There are many forms of feminism all centering around the idea that women are oppressed, men are privileged and there is a \textbf{patriarchy}. Of course the idea that men are oppressing women and have privilege is going to bred a hatred of men, that's just \textbf{common} sense. Now liberation feminism centers around the idea that \textbf{gender} it self is oppressive. While cultural feminism, aka modern feminism, is based around the concept that masculinity is toxic and that way of thinking will defiantly bred a hatred of men. Tell me, since feminisim, by dictionary definition, is a movement to give women the rights of men and women aren't lacking legal rights that men have how can anyone really call themselves a feminist? If we are really going off the definition you can't be a feminist unless you advocate for FGM and women being drafted. I'm glad you do make a distinction between individual \textbf{racism} and institutionalized \textbf{racism}.When did I say women werent discriminated against? I said I will not call myself a feminist when there are no legal rights women are lacking that men have. I still advocate \textbf{gender} equality and I'm against \textbf{sexism} but that has \textbf{nothing} to do with legal rights.You don't seem to understand what I meant by biological instinct. Here I'll give you an example, people are normally attracted to the opposite \textbf{sex}, people are normally cisgendered,  men are on average taller than women, but of course that doesn't hold true for every single person alive. In the same way males are normally masculine and females are normally feminine. When I took about masculinity and femininity I am referring to things like desires not the colors pink and blue.I don't care about what \textbf{gender} the judge is, there is a court biased against men, plain and simple. It doesn't matter if the judge is a men or a women, it's wrong. I never said women want to hold men down, I don't think that.A better example would be, when you get robbed you should call the police. If someone beats you up you should call the police. If somebody breaks a contract with you, you should take them to court. If you own an apartment complex and someone isn't paying rent you take them to court. That's why these laws exist. I find the term people of color incredibly offensive. indigenous people, Africans and Asians have \textbf{nothing} in \textbf{common} other than the fact that they aren't European.

Just for future reference, some people find the term offensive. I said the \textbf{gender} gap is real and there are many reasons for it, I never said discrimination wasn't one. In fact I think social influence and \textbf{sexism} is a big reason why men and women don't take jobs dominated by the opposite \textbf{sex}. I believe the only way to fix this is to encourage men and women to go into the jobs they want, no matter what those jobs be. I do, however, think the \textbf{gender} gap will always exist.Yes, I'm for real. Let me repeat it, there are no laws forcing people into \textbf{gender} roles.No, it is both nurture and nature.

I mean, what does taking care of a kid, making sure they eat, educate them etc. has to do with biology?The second link is about compassion, which WOULD be connected to \textbf{gender} roles (the idea that, because women are "more commpassionate", they gravitate towards child-raising). It says, and I quote, "the differences [between men's and women's brains]  are subtle and there is no single area of the brain that we can say clearly distinguishes a male brain from a female brain". Moreover, "compassion is natural and no \textbf{gender} differences have emerged across these studies", although they do point that men and women activate different areas in their brains when they experience compassion.The article also points out varios points towards socialization being responsible for the differences in compassion between men and women - for example: "A large body of research has shown that men and women have very different experiences and that they are socialized extremely differently as of infancy. Think about girls who are handed dolls and baby carriages to play with (suggesting nurturing and caring behaviors) and boys who are handed superheroes and toy soldiers (suggesting fighting, and protecting behaviors). When girls (or women) cry it is seen as normal but if boys (or men) do, they are often taught crying is a sign of weakness and is not 'manly'".As for the third article, I'm having big doubts about the author, Satoshi Kanazawa. Apparently, he's considered a bad \textbf{apple} in the evolutionary psychology field. [LINK] > I'll ask again, are you a liberation feminist?Frankly, I'm not sure what a "liberation feminist" even IS, but I'm going out on a limb and assume that you're talking about first and second-wave feminist, back in the days where women had to be "freed" from a regime that forbid them to vote, work in many workfields, or disobey their husbands in anything.Now, I don't see much wrong in that back then, especially about their objective of abolishing the institution of marriage (seriously, "obey your husband" included having \textbf{sex} with him whether you wanted it or not); but to this day, I don't think that those ideas can still be applied, ESPECIALLY the exclusion of non-whites and transpeople that went on at the time.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Dario Carraresi I, as someone who can read a dictionary can say that, that's not the dictionary definition of feminism.The thing is feminism was made to give women the rights as men, you can fight for the same rights as a group and still hate that group. It's normal to hate someone who had more than you so believing men are privileged and wen don't have the same privileges will cause some women to hate men. It's also normal to hate your oppressor so if you believe men are oppressing you it would be normal to hate them. There is no \textbf{patriarchy}, a government that is run by more men than women, yes, a \textbf{patriarchy}, no. If there was a \textbf{patriarchy}, a system of government that excluded women, there would be no female politicians.I actually agree loosely with liberation feminist. I'll answer your last question too because it has to do with this... Liberation feminisim is also called radical feminism and it is the second wave of feminism. They believe that \textbf{gender} is oppressive. Although their concept of \textbf{gender} is solely \textbf{gender} roles and \textbf{gender} roles (on a side note, I think that's why many terfs and transphobic radical feminist exist). Their concept of \textbf{gender} is not all correct but I do agree with them on the basis that they way \textbf{gender} is viewed by society is wrong and needs to change. They have some other views that are more subjective, which I tend to disagree with. Some of their ideology confuses me, many I've talked to seem to truely believe their ideology will help men and women but they often reject the notion that feminism, at least their feminisim, is for men. To me you sound like a mixture of a liberation and cultural feminist.As for cultural feminist, yes they do think masculinity is toxic. Or at least that's what it has translated to. I understand this ideology doesn't equal \textbf{misandry} but when you believe masculinity is toxic, or certain forms of masculinity is toxic, and when men are often masculine this can create a hatred of men. Cultural feminist are the type of feminist who are often misandrist, at least in my experience. They are the type of feminist who would say a matriarchy would be good. You're right political ideas don't fit in dictionary definitions and we should defined them by their actions and ideas. Well feminist actions have not been great, sadly this movement's voices are extremist. Sure feminist have done some good things but they have done some things that have made me and many other people turn away from the movement. I brought up women have legal rights in the west because feminist was for give women rights thaten have. I call myself an MRA because men are lacking rights, if women were also lacking rights I'd call myself a feminist or preferably a WRA.Actually \textbf{sexual} orientation is a mixture of nature and nurture, leaning more towards nature. Like I said \textbf{gender} roles and masculinity/femininity are different. I'm not talking about women wanting to wear dresses or anything like that. I'm talking about women having the desire to have children and men feeling the need to provide and women being more empathetic ect. These are because males and females have different brains.I'm not bashing feminism when I say there is a bias against men. It's not just judges either, jury's have these biases too. No amount of laws will change this, if laws aren't being enforced that is the problem. This is actually happening a lot, laws not being enforced.I linked the first article because the \textbf{gender} role/steryotype is men must be strong/men are stronger than women. The stereotype has some truth to it backed up by biology, of course this doesn't hold true for every men the key words are 'on average'. "Men are physically stronger than women, who have, on average, less total muscle mass, both in absolute terms and relative to total body mass. The greater muscle mass of men is the result of testosterone-induced muscular hypertrophy. Men also have denser, stronger bones, tendons, and ligaments." -  [LINK]  The linked the second article because it talks about differences in compassion point at different reasons, not just social conditioning. " compassion more explicitly. Taylor found that the "fight or flight" response is characteristic of men whereas women tend toward a different tendency: "tend and befriend." Women faced with a stressful situation are more likely to respond by socializing, bonding with others and seeking protection and nurturance within a community. These tendencies may have been evolutionarily adaptive since we have evolved in communities where women's primary responsibility was raising and protecting offspring who needed protection while men traditionally engaged in hunting and warfare. A new study, however, suggest that men, too, also can respond to stress through social bonding. Which is what I've been trying to explain to you this whole time, whole yes certain things are socially conditioning some are biological and either way we have adpated to have these insticts.Finally, women may at times have higher levels of "oxytocin" - sometimes called the "cuddle hormone" or "love hormone" because it is linked to bonding, social connection and monogamy. Oxytocin is produced during sexfor both men and women but is particularly important during childbirth. It is produced in women during labor and lactation in women and is believed to trigger bonding and nurturing behaviors."" While women's expression involved nurturing and bonding, men's compassion was expressed through protecting and ensuring survival. Compassion just took on a different "look and feel" depending on our evolutionary needs for survival." -  [LINK] As for the third article, I'll have to read the link you have me but I did not know that.If you'd like to read more about the differences between male and female brains I can link some stuff for you.

The stereotype has some truth to it backed up by biology, of course this doesn't hold true for every men the key words are 'on average'.And what does this have to do with women being outright excluded from mare workplaces such as construction or mining? You may justify "There are less miner women because there are, on average, more men who are fit for mining than women who are fit for mining", but an almost total exclusion is unjustifiable.And if we move on to combat roles in the Army, the argument becomes even more ridiculous. Upper body physical strength isn't anymore important (How strong you have to be to pull a trigger?), and carrying lots of stuff requires lower body physical strength - where women have the advantage.Now, about the three links you've provided me at the end of your comment:1) It says \textbf{nothing} about men and women being "coded" for "breadwinner/protector" and "caretaker/nurturer" respectively. In fact, I quote: "Men and women process certain emotions differently. Emotions are useful. They make the brain pay attention. These differences are a product of complex interactions between nature and nurture."2) The second link is broken, but I managed to find the article. I quote:The hippocampus has been thought to be disproportionately large in the brains of females, implying that women's tendency to express themselves more outwardly emotionally than men has a neurological explanation. This new meta-study evaluated the methods and conclusions of the 76 MRI studies looking at the hippocampal volume (HCV) in over 6,000 males and females. No difference was found, after correcting for the overall brain volumes. Not only that, but even when \textbf{age} was taken into account, the HCV volumes did not show any differences between the brains of different sexes.'Sex differences in the brain are irresistible to those looking to explain stereotypic differences between men and women,' said lead author Lise Eliot, an associate professor of neuroscience at the university's medical school, in a statement. 'They often make a big splash, in spite of being based on small samples. But as we explore multiple datasets and are able to coalesce very large samples of males and females, we find these differences often disappear or are trivial. ' [LINK] 3) Also says \textbf{nothing} about \textbf{gender} roles being "coded"; it just talks about how men tend to have better spatial processing, sensori-motor speed, and handling of single precise tasks, while women tend to have better capacity for attention, word and face memory, social cognition, and multitasking.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Gender, Nothing, Patriarchy, Sexual, Zero & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Youngsters, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}12/967 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.241 \\  \hline

Regardless of how you look at it it's all due to \textbf{sexism} and \textbf{gender} inequality. If the problems are all \textbf{gender} based, and they are, then \textbf{gender} as a concept is the problem.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Kittens Țepeș Guess what? The huge moron is back! And has started tearing apart Anti-Feminist Pro-Equality's bullshit. You listen too, Miller.So. This thing is 21 pages long on Word, including images. I'm gonna try and debate this textwall as quickly as I can, but there's a LOT of stuff. Luckily, most of this stuff is completely unsourced, so there's that. First of all: child custody! No, child custody is not "50/50" by default. Wanna know why? Because the default is not "both the mother and the father equally take care of the child". It's "one parent stays at home to take care of the child, the other goes to work and pursues their career". Since the most beneficial thing for the kid is to stay with the parent who actually took care of it, that's the default.You don't like that women are the majority of these stay-at-home parents? How about dismantling the social norms that make it so that "men = breadwinner, women = housekeeper"? Oh, right, nevermind, anti-feminists don't want women to work in actual jobs like mining, because that's a man's job and women are weak and they'd never sully themselves with those hard jobs - except for all the time THEY DO. [LINK]  [LINK]  [LINK] Really, if you believe that, due to "biology", women are more fit for nurturing children, you can't whine when people believe that men are WORSE at nurturing children.Also: Glenn Sacks? Really? That's the kind source you want to use? Next: false rape allegations aren't an "epidemic". [LINK] Nor do they have much success. [LINK] And they're already being considered crimes - it's called "wasting the police's time" (making a false accusation), "perversion of the course of justice" (in some states, for making a false accusation; for others, for obstructing the investigation or forging false evidence), "slander" (making a false accusation), and "perjury, 1st degree" (making a false statement in court).(By the way: the law to grant anonimity for those accused of rape? The law that, according to Anti-Feminism Pro-Equality, was repealed by feminists? The article cited by AFPE does NOT mention feminists. At all. Good job exposing the imaginary feminists that only exist in your paranoia, AFPE.) Next: the sentencing bias! No, it's not that men get harsher sentences - it's because women get lighter sentences, because of misogynistic myths such as "women are weaker than men", "more caring than men", "more emotional than men", etc. You know where this line of reasoning ends? "Women has less capacity of violence than men".Also? Feminists haven't caused this sentencing bias, nor are they preventing anyone from fixing it. In fact, feminists are working to fix this bias. The judges unfair towards men? They themselves are male. Female judges are fair - to the point that an estimated all-female judicial district would give women harsher sentences than men.The evidence presented here suggests that judicial demographics have little influence on prison sentences in general, but do impact racial and \textbf{gender} disparities. The findings regarding \textbf{gender} in the case of serious offenses are quite striking: the greater the proportion of female judges in a district, the lower the \textbf{gender} disparity for that district. I interpret this as evidence of a paternalistic bias among male judges that favors women. [LINK] Also, that BBC article cited by AFPE? It doesn't say "Feminists don't want female culprits to have the same sentences than men, or go to prison at all". It says "Feminists want female culprits to get community service instead of prison time if possible, because, by sentencing those women to prison, there's a really high chance of reoffending". Do you even read the stuff you link, AFPE? Next: domestic violence! And AFPE shows xir ass yet again. You see, the first link, where he brings up as "proof" that feminists tried to "suppress evidence showing that half of domestic violence is done by women", instead points out that the studies who MRAs use to claim "women commit domestic violence as much as men!" have multiple methodical errors:1) They declare someone "violent" once they've committed one single physically violent act. For those studies, someone slapping their partner once is as violent as an abuser committing an ongoing series of abusive acts.2) They declare someone "violent" once they've committed one violent act regardless of the intensity of said act. For those studies, someone slapping their partner is as violent as an abuser who broke their partner's arm.3) They declare someone "violent" once they've committed one violent act regardless of the reason for it. For those studies, someone who acted out of self-defense is as violent as an abuser.As for the anti-feminist studies he cites... well, he doesn't really cite them. He just cites the bare summaries of them, "conveniently" neglecting to mention the methodological flaws of those studies. You know, the ones I've listed above.That's all for today.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/819 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.366 \\  \hline

That was 95 years ago, not 40. Oh and about marital rape, states started to make laws about in the 70s. In the 90s the majority of the U.S. had outlawed it. In 1993 North Carolina was the last stated to outlaw marital rape.It doesn't matter why feminist hate men, they could hate them because they have penises or because they believe they are oppressors. Neither is right, men aren't oppressing women, women aren't oppressed.How many time have I said, I don't care what feminist positions are, I don't care if they oppose it or are for it or caused it. So I don't care if feminist are for or not for circumcision. Those who are, I commend them to speak out against it. What I do know is feminist, often, view FGM as worse than male infant genitalia mutilation.No, infant males do not have the right to genitalia integrity. There parents can selfishly agree to let a doctor cut there babies penis up, possibly resulting in death, and the infant has no say.Good for them, what are feminist doing about men having to register for selective service? I've seen so many different opinions from feminist on this matter, some saying they'd be all for everyone having to register.Do you hear your self? It's because judges and people believe "MEN are more violent than women", it's because "MEN are unemphatic and cold" that is why there senteces are harsh. The reason why WOMENS sentences are light, sometimes so light it make me want to hurl, is because "women are pure and kind and good" and "women can't really hurt men". It's not \textbf{misogynist}, it's not even misandrist, its both, it's just plain sexist to both genders.Oh, if you could stop assuming my view points just because im against feminism that would be fucking G R E A T.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Women's Issues1) Less recognition for military bravery; \textbf{sexual} assault covered up within the military; as well as more barriers for females to join the military because they're "weak" and "stupid".2) As women generally live longer, they have to suffer disproportionately from loneliness, depression, watching loved ones die, widowhood; and are more at risk from dementia and cancer. The general governmental health IS the men's health; the female health was created as women's heath issues are ignored by general/male health.3) Circumcision happens at a much greater scale for women; with 8000 women and girls every single day having their genitals mutilated or ripped off without painkillers or antibiotics. Not to mention "breast ironing".4) Unfair share of domestic and parental duties in the home; and precarity in the workplace. 5) Women's domestic violence shelters getting destroyed and burned by angry men who could very well build their own shelters.6) Risk of pregnancy and agony of childbirth; guilt-tripping over abortion; and reproductive rights being stripped away by new insane government. Men wanting to control HER body then playing the victim when she makes a choice for herself.7) DNA is required to do a paternity test.8) Female-bashing on media is viewed as funny, justifiable, and natural; \textbf{misogyny} is rampant on forums and youtube; and men play the victim.9) Assumptions all women who make accusations make false accusations. Lack of justice for female victims.10) Being sent to jail for things men don't (e.g. going topless when it's 35C; attempting suicide while pregnant; having miscarriages; being the spouse of a killer even if you didn't know about it; being stoned to death for being raped; lack of evidence in a case of rape being conflated with "lying"; etc).11) Higher rates of depression; self-harm, and attempted suicide, yet no media attention. Suicide seen as a "men's" issue.12) Death in the home.I'll add another..... When a video about how men suffer from \textbf{sexism} is posted, it gets very high ratings and practically all the comments agree with the video. A video about how women suffer from \textbf{sexism}? Low ratings; threats and insults at the producer; and comments villainizing women and victimizing men in the comments...

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Having watched some other Laci Green videos, I've some respect for some of the things she says generally but in this one she has a dangerous mix of just enough partial truth to make her point of view sound sensible but packaged up with some false assumptions.What she is doing is assuming that men handle some situations differently to women due to some sort of oppression rather than genuine differences with the way our brains are wired. In nature, almost every species has evolved hard-wired \textbf{gender} roles that give said species the best chance to survive and thrive. That needs multiple different qualities such as the strength to defend yourself against predators, the desire to reproduce in order to keep your species going and the ability to protect your offspring.Diversity is not a bad thing, it's essential for survival. Now, in human beings its not as clear cut as some species, there are men that possess many qualities we associate with femininity and vice versa with women but on the whole, we still have these genetic traits that have served our species well in dominating our planet.Laci, like many misguided feminists, sees masculinity as some sort of problem that she needs to solve by making men think like women but that is not only bad for men, it's bad for women too.There's \textbf{nothing} wrong with thinking with your emotions, that sort of nurturing quality is really useful when dealing with other human beings but you also need the balance of more rational minds too. That is how we develop tools and science that enable us to evolve.Every patronising, belittling point she makes, somehow always comes back to talking about women. She describes \textbf{sexism} as something that's "typically against women", which is contradictory to the faux male sympathising undertone of the video. She also talks about \textbf{sexism} being "shaming the feminine". Why would it be sexist to shame the feminine but perfectly fine to belittle the masculine as she does in this video? Feminists always argue that feminism is about equality, but when it comes down to it, their arguments are always centred around women.Problems that effect us all like violence (men are statistically more likely to be violently attacked than women) and \textbf{sexual} assault (men can and are assaulted too) are described in a way that makes them appear as solely women's issues. Men do not define themselves against women at all but they increasingly find themselves being attacked for displaying any masculine qualities in a world that is becoming increasingly biased against them. It's time to shelve the myth that feminism is about equality and expose the hypocrisy of this vile ideology. Instead, look to egalitarianism which looks at issues from a humanistic standpoint, challenging civil right violations where they occur regardless of \textbf{gender}, not because of it!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender, Nothing, Sexism, Sexual & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}6/475 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.263 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@skwcw2001 Do you watch the news? In Australia, the Minister of Women is male.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@saraahh27Sure, there are male voices who epitomise the male \textbf{gender} role.To me, that's like saying "there are mostly female voices in homes taking care of children, the female perspective is already dominant among young children in the home and into primary school, so why do you need a minister for women?"With the answer being "to expand women's roles into areas where they previously didn't have open access to, and since most women are not even aware that this is even an option to them, a key goal is to raise consciousness that this is actually an option for women."You said that "aged care and tax" affect mostly women.Those are two things which are almost opposite in their affect.Aged care directly affects mostly women because there is an inequality in how long men and women live on average. Women are living longer, most of that is due to unnatural causes. If men are typically living less long, they don't need so much aged care because they are behind to begin with.About tax, tax directly affects men more, because since men typically earn more money, they typically pay more tax. This is based on an inequality between how much men and women earn in the first place.If women typically earn less money, they have less tax issues because they are behind to begin with.In both of these cases, the issue you mentioned is a result of an underlying and deeper inequality.Funnily enough, both are quite connected, the mining and construction boom in Australia brought a long of wealth. Mostly men worked in those industries and earned a lot of money (tax problems for men). Yet those industries are notoriously dangerous, the vast majority of people injured and killed (90+) at work were men. (causes women to need more aged care)I don't know about welfare, but your childcare example seems to be another perfect example of addressing a surface level issue, rather than going deeper to underlying systemic dynamics. Men have very few advocates in terms of expanding their roles among children, none in politics that I am aware of.A minister for men would be meant to advocate for things like an affirmative action campaign for fathers. To encourage a social shift to make stay at home dads a more \textbf{common} and accepted role. That would be their job.A minister for women is very unlikely to do that for men.The reason that it seems like there is no need for a minister men is either1) it's unnecessary, men are doing greator2) men's \textbf{gender} role expansion and unique issues have been so under explored that most people are not even aware they exist, including most men\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Common, Gender & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}3/459 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.654 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Light And Shadow I can't argue with anything you're saying. When I mentioned tax impacting women though, I was thinking about the amount of single women who are raising children on their own since they'd have more expenses. And I agree that it should be acceptable for men to be stay at home dads and involved in childcare, especially since I myself work in a childcare centre that has male employees. I'm not saying that men don't have any issues, in an ideal world we'd have a minister of \textbf{gender} equality. But we don't.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@saraahh27Yeah, in theory someone can be a minister of women regardless of their \textbf{sex}. It's not like a man can't learn about and study women's issues, and advocate for them.But in practice, having a male leader speak on behalf of women's empowerment isn't exactly a strong symbolic role model for women. At a minimum it can feel a little off. Likely it would cause \textbf{blind} spots, or completely miss the point entirely on issues, especially if having a male leader is a relatively \textbf{common}.So I can appreciate you feeling that way.What I would say in response, is that this is also how many men feel.The \textbf{gender} debate is dominated by feminism, many men feel that it doesn't address their needs or issues. Can you blame men for wanting a men's movement to address men's inequalities? Or at the very least a \textbf{gender} neutral equality movement?I think the two ideas are actually very similar, just like the feelings that arise as a result.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Blind, Common, Gender, Sex & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}5/168 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.976 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small It doesn't need to be a competition between the two though. I'm not blaming men, I agreed with you that there are men's issues that need to be addressed, but feminism does actually stand up for men's issues. Part of feminism is that men can partake in roles that society sees as a "\textbf{woman}'s job" and that men who are more feminine than masculine shouldn't be put down for it. I've seen many feminists talk about those issues. Jesus, I simply say "the minister of women should be a \textbf{woman}" and you come over with this "WHAT ABOUT THE MEN?!" attitude. I work with boys from the ages 2 - 5. I've seen those boys come to work with nail polish on and get made fun of and I've stuck up for them every time. I've seen parents try to force \textbf{gender} stereotypes on their boys and have supported those boys when they want to wear a dress out of the dress-ups or want to ride the pink scooter instead of the blue scooter.

So that can feel overwhelming and push even the most patient person to react less than perfectly.Let me ask you something, do you think this is unique to women? Do you think it is any different for men who act outside their accepted \textbf{gender} role? or even question their \textbf{gender} role?How supportive of a man speaking about men's issues and challenges do you think most individuals are? how supportive do you think the mainstream is? how well do you think speaking about men's issues and feelings of unfair treatment is accepted in a culture where the main \textbf{gender} narrative is about men as oppressors and women as victims?I'm sorry if that question doesn't really feel supportive, I'm asking that as gently as I can. It's not even meant to be a rhetorical question, I actually really want to know what you imagine it is like for a man to speak about those issues?For example, if you take virtually women's issue, then expand the discussion and talk about how it affects both women AND men.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Light And Shadow Women are taught to be polite, lady-like, apologize for things they shouldn't apologize for, the list goes on. I mean just the other day, a guy shoved past me and I found myself apologizing to him?! I realized immediately after how stupid it was of me to apologize, but it's really hard to unlearn those things. Men are taught to be masculine, loud, outgoing, and a bunch of other things. I think that men who don't fit in that stereotype do have trouble being heard because they may not be as confident, they may be embarrassed about the fact that they're not masculine, etc. Then on the other side of it, masculine men might have trouble talking about those things because they have been taught not to show any emotion, which is a serious problem and is one of the main factors that leads to violence against women. So I don't doubt for one second that it's hard for men to talk about their issues in a way that's comfortable for them, but I do think men have an easier time being heard than women. I recently read a book called Everyday \textbf{Sexism} by Laura Bates. In that book, she explained that since she started the Everyday \textbf{Sexism} project, she has had plenty of rape threats for speaking about the issue. As far as I know, men don't get rape threats when they talk about these issues, and if they do it's far fewer than the amount that women get.I think that (in most cases) women are afraid of talking about these issues because they're scared of being physically hurt or threatened by men (occasionally even other women), whereas I think men (again, in most cases) are afraid of talking about these issues because they're embarrassed about being seen as emotional or weak. I feel like both of those issues could improve if parents started teaching or just allowing their boys to express their emotions in a healthy way.You ask a lot of questions, I don't even know if I've answered any of them, haha.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/350 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.571 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@saraahh27I agree with about 70 to 80 of what you are saying, some things I have a different opinion on.Perfect example by \@Quintin May  just now.When that guy pushed past you (apparently quite rudely), how do you think he would have reacted if you said to him what \@Quintin May  just said to you?Do you think that would have increased or decreased your personal safety? (compared to how you actually reacted)If we assign \textbf{gender} roles as the cause for the stereotypical reactions of men and women in that situation, then it seems that it is actually men who are systematically more likely to be victims of violence.On the other hand, if a guy metaphorically "pushes past you" at work or in the boardroom etc, then in that situation it is definitely detrimental to act "lady like" and apologise for something that isn't your fault. It means you shrink and give up your agency and personal power.In that scenario, it is women who are systemically more likely to be victims of passivity, with results of things like the glass ceiling.So the answer is to overcome that right?But when you say things like "Then on the other side of it, masculine men might have trouble talking about those things because they have been taught not to show any emotion, which is a serious problem and is one of the main factors that leads to violence against women."You automatically focused on "violence against women".If you care about equality, then part of that is equally caring about men's emotions, and men's vulnerability. So then why would someone focus on "violence against women"? instead of the more relevant "violence against men?" Or even "violence against humans?" or "Violence by men"?All of those make much more sense then to focus on the safety of the group which is statistically the safest.I get that it's an emotional thing, and hard to overcome. I totally agree.The thing is, in order to overcome the downsides of a \textbf{gender} role, you have to also be willing to let go of the upsides.If women want to have equal agency and equal personal power, they have to be willing to give up their unequal protection.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/378 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.529 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Dario Carraresi My entire point is that society is dictated by instincts, just not in the obvious ways you think. Seems like you don't understand how instincts exactly work. It's usually not something people exactly understand when it takes control, since it's an instinct and something we really don't think about. Example: Males look for curves on a \textbf{woman} because it's something we're supposed to be preprogrammed to look for because it's a sign of fertility. Men competing  *for women* usually doesn't mean we're killing rivals. However, men will have a killer instinct if it means they protect the mate of their choice. In modern society, killing is not usually needed, so that is why I'm not killing the male rivals in my neighborhood. And now back to the main point. Natural instincts will always dictate society and people's behavior whether it helps you or hurts you. \textbf{Nothing} what i say matters, and \textbf{nothing} you say matters either.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@ZaK So, let me get this straight.You're saying that we can't control our instincts.But then, you say that in modern society, killing is not needed. You've admitted that we've suppressed the instinct to kill our rivals - maybe not in individual cases, but definitely at a social coesion level.So, what is it? Are instincts suppressable in our society, or not? It's quite simple, really.If you defend rigid \textbf{gender} roles because "instincts cannot be suppressed", then also the instinct to eliminate our rivals can't be suppressed, either.If, viceversa, you say that we did suppress the instinct to kill our rivals at a social level, then you have to admit that rigid \textbf{gender} roles, who stem from our instincts, can be suppressed at a social level.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/129 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.55 \\  \hline

You did not understand what i wrote, or perhaps I was not clear in my statements. Some instincts which are not absolutely needed are not always obvious in which they are displayed. An instinct to kill rivals is not obvious, but since I'm not an expert on human nature, I cannot be sure whether or not males actually have an instinct to kill other rival males, and chances are you can't be sure either.You also quoted a line i never wrote again.Even if we did have a instinct to kill male rivals, saying that because one instinct can be suppressed means that all instincts can be suppressed is an uneducated assumption. A better example of a natural instinct which are used to define a \textbf{gender} role is how women are pressured to look attractive more than men. They are pressured to look sexy because of their natural instinct to attract a male. There's women who like to think they can suppress that instinct, but the truth is they really can't.

But in our society, today, where our lives are formed by said society (notice how animals don't have structured societies), you can't possibly expect for men to stay the same as they were 10,000 years ago.

There are so many more scenarios where humans don't exist than there are where they do. So, biology isn't relevant anymore when it comes to \textbf{gender}. Our genders are completely controlled by how our society view them- ever noticed that women aren't treated the same/don't act the same in all societies? It's not because of biological reasons, it's because genders are viewed/treated differently in different cultures. Here's a bit of reading [LINK] The Cherokee's tribes were Matrifocal- not only that, but women owned all the properties. Also, the men had to consult an all-female council before going to war.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Laci,I'm a man and, while I don't self-identify as a feminist, I do believe in most of the things that are promoted by feminism. And, while I agree that there is pressure on males to behave in a traditionally male manner, and engage in traditionally male jobs and activities, I don't think it is fair, nor correct, to say that it's because we don't want to be like women that we behave as, or do the things, we do. For a long time, I worked in bars, at various times as a bartender, bouncer, and a bar manager. Working in a bar was often dangerous and violent. I would break up, or be in, fights about three times a night on weekends, and about another three during the regular workweek. But, I worked in the bars, not because I didn't want to be perceived as feminine... or even because I wish to be perceived as being masculine. I did it because it fit my temperament, capabilities, and my skillset. And, ultimately, because I really liked it.The best job I ever had was at a bar that was notorious in the area as being the most dangerous bar in town. However, the truth of it was that our female clientele felt safer in our bar than anywhere else in the area. It may sound like male chest thumping, but, although I never thought about it like this at the time, aside the tribal camaraderie with my fellow employees and hardcore regulars, I liked it allowed me to do the things that were, for want of a better word, manly.What I mean that in homo sapiens, the utility of \textbf{sexual} dimorphism is that men were more specialized in the things you said. We're, generally, larger, stronger, and more aggressive. I enjoyed the exhilaration dangerous situations engendered. I took satisfaction in defending our women from misogynists and our men from bullies (kind of an alpha male role). This is going to sound sexist, but I mentioned \textbf{sexual} dimorphism. Men evolved to be in the role of hunters and protectors and women to be in the role of gatherers and nurturers.Please, understand that I'm not saying that's the way it should be in modern society. Men and women should be free to be whatever they want, and act in any way they want, so long as their actions are not harmful to others. But, it is to a certain extent, for some of us at least, the way our brains are wired and bodies "designed".My point, if I have one, is that in addition to the environmental/social factors (nurture), there are also genetic/physical factors (nature) that play into our collective psychological makeups. Some men, and women, go into more traditionally sexually defined roles because they are pressured to do so, while others go into more traditionally sexually defined roles because they just naturally gravitate toward them.I think many men are frightened by, resistant to, and/or actively opposed to feminism because they think that feminism is promoting the idea that men should be more like women or that women should be more like men, when, in fact, if I'm understanding feminism, what's being promoted, for men and women is to be who you are and/or be free to try to become what you wish to be, and have respect for everyone else's right to be who they are and/or who they wish to be.In \textbf{gender} and/or \textbf{sexual} orientation issues, as in racial issues, I think the message should be that we should celebrate our diversity and differences, while at the same time promoting equality and tolerance, be you male, female, \textbf{L\textbf{G\textbf{BT}}}, asexual, or whatever.I know you're extremely busy, so I don't expect a response, but any response you might have would be welcomed.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender, LGBT, Sexual & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General, Sexual Identity - General, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality, Sexual Identity - Transexuality & \cellcolor{green!5}7/636 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.101 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small This is one of the few of Laci's videos I had to downvote, and I owe it to her to tell why.TL;DR: even if the arguments sure do have a core of truth, your analysis of their cause is overly simplistic, they are also very incomplete.First of all if you want to know how \textbf{sexism} affects men, please ask them. Speak TO them, not ABOUT them, as you do with everyone else. You'll get a more complete picture. For instance, the complaint that violence of women on men seems socially (more) acceptable (even applauded in movies and the like).Second, I was an introvert youth, insecure and a "mother's boy" with also some 'feminine' traits like empathy. Also bad at sports, \textbf{skinny}, you know the type. Being at that time on a boys-only school, I must admit that generally, I was well accepted among peers. No one pressured me into becoming 'more masculine' (why should they, more competition?). It's only during higher education, when my friends got adentures and girlfriends that I was told to "maybe do some powerbuilding", or "persue girls more aggressively" (essentially 'become extravert'). From fine, strong, sexually liberated and independent young women mind you; because they know what they like themselves in a man, I can only imagine.Now don't worry, after a few years I found my self-confidence, it had \textbf{nothing} to do with becoming a jock (I never did), and only then I also found my wonderful partner.

But if I was dating someone who was spending my hard earned money on dresses, shoes, and clothing I should be the one managing the money. Bills need to be paid and looking good isn't going to pay for them.Pressure to lead isn't \textbf{gender} specific. All of our teachers from high school, mine and yours, wanted both genders to lead. Their job was to make us leaders. If women don't stand up to the plate when they are given the opportunity, which is available to women, then that is their fault.No \textbf{sexism} has \textbf{nothing} to do with power. The definition on screen is right but the definition coming out of your mouth is wrong. No men can't get custody of children because of the \textbf{woman} privilege of nurturing. Our court system believes women are more nurturing and because of that fact men have to pay women alimony on the basis that women can't take care of a child and have a job at the same time. If we taught men in society to be non-assertive \textbf{nothing} would get done. If 2 men apply to the same job and both of them were non-assertive their entire lives how does the employer know which applicant is more qualified for a job? Non-assertive/aggressive behaviors are less rewarding. People who act this way get pushed around in life. They don't take chances and are generally the last person that would get a promotion in their career and the first person to be laid off.Everything you are spewing out on the internet Laci is detrimental to society.

Maybe they'd be forced into therapy.Third: do you know one of the causes of clinical depression, which is probably THE major cause for suicide? Emotional repression. And do you know why men are more susceptible to emotional repression? Because they've been thaught that crying is for girls. That crying is a sign of weakness. That "real men don't cry".

Since they've been thaught that "male=/=female", "female=weak", "male=/=weak", and "male=strong", they've learn that anything not-male is weak. Thus, they'll treat everyone not-male as weak.

Oh, didn't you know that it was two white officers arresting two Latino men who weren't doing anything, probably just to discriminate them? Now you know. [LINK] DV laws are \textbf{gender} neutral. It's not the law's fault if more men are perpetrators of DV than women. And there's no law that forces to arrest "the heaviest person" - it depends on who attacked who, for what motive, and if the response was appropriate.And guess who spread the belief that "men can't be abused by women, because as if a \textbf{woman} could ever overpower a man"? Guess who refers to an underage boy having \textbf{sex} (read: statutory rape) with an older \textbf{woman} as "getting some experience of life"? Guess who doesn't believe that a man could ever object to \textbf{sex} with a good-looking \textbf{woman} - unless he's a "\textbf{faggot}" or "mentally ill"?

When the hiring managers were allowed to see the applicants' test results, the bias was reduced but not eliminated. (1,5 men hired for every \textbf{woman}) [LINK] Another example: application forms were mailed to various STEM employers. For each specific job, the applications sent were all word-by-word identical except for the applicant's name, \textbf{gender} and personal info. Results: female "applicants" were less likely to be hired than male "applicants" - and when it happened, they were rated as less competent and offered less money (4000\$ less money on average).

But as it stands, if it were not for men, civilization would have died out by disease, hunger and a mulititude of other causes by now! In almost every area of comparison besides social interaction, men are superior to women!Women do have one thing over men that we will never have!

If a \textbf{woman} has a baby today it is entirely because of her own lifestyle choice. It is no longer acceptable to say he had \textbf{sex} so he has to fund her lifestyle choices. Sorry but unless the \textbf{woman} was under 18, she can not take \textbf{sex} to mean consent to fatherhood.  It is grossly irresponsible and and unjust to the child, the man and to society. If she insists on bringing a child into the world then she must fully fund it. Not society and not someone who never consented to such a decision."It takes 2 to tango" Well if I tango with someone that does not entitle them to use the law to force me to pay for their drinks and hotels for the next 20 years. I only agreed to a dance. I didn't agree to anything more and the government certainly has no business forcing me to pay for her to go to dances with other men for the next 20 years.Let's say Mark had AIDS and he knew it. And let's say Mark had \textbf{sex} with a \textbf{woman} wihtout telling her about that. She had \textbf{sex} with a man and she knew it was possible she could die if she had \textbf{sex} with a man. Therefore it is not Marks responsibility to tell her or bare any responsibility for her medical problems and death. Does that seem fair to you? Of course not. It is a serious crime. forcing the father to pay so called child support is simply creating incentives to have fatherless child. Neither the tax payers nor people who dod not consent to having a child should pay. Wipe out those incentives and the number of fatherless children would plumet overnight. Everyone would be better off except for all those women expecting others to pay for their own lifestyle choices. At what point did the father have any reproductive rights? The mother chooses to have the child. If the male did not want to have the child in the first place then it is entirely her lifestyle choice and she must pay for her own life style choices. This should be made clear to her before she makes that choice. That aside let's assume the father either initially or subsequently wanted the child. Day 2. The child support.This has become a misnomer. The vast majority of parents support their children regardless of what the law says. If he child stays with the father only 3 weeks of the entire year, he still needs to pay to have available housing for that child for the entire year. What we now call child support is the compulsory component of child support. This should never be designed to be more than the bare minimum required to raise a child and it should be split between both parents since the child will be spending at least some time with both parents. Anything over the bare minimum is a parenting decision. It is not the business of the government to make those parenting decisions. Instead we have the government removing parenting decisions from one parent - the father - and giving all the decisions and choices to the other parent. This is music to feminists ears but it is an unmitigated failure for children and fathers. It creates a spiral of negative unintended consequences. That is an entire topic on it's own.The problem with this is that it is all about accountability of the male without rights, choices and decision making options. It is a little like taxation without representation. I think this is outdated thinking for two reasons:(a) first of all, men should have equal reproductive rights to women. They don't. Their accountability should be in proportion to their rights. Also men should have equal reproductive options to women. They don't and probably never will. Hence their accountability needs to go had in hand with an explicit consent and decision. I don't think it is valid in the western world to to say \textbf{sex} = consent to have a baby. That ignores modern day realities and ultimately leads to a host of negative outcomes for children. (b) it is plain barbaric to remove the parenting bond and parenting decisions from a father for no good reason and then also force him to pay for that 'privilege'. What is really occurring is not that the male is being made accountable for his sperm - it is that the male is been made accountable for other's parenting decisions that he very strongly objects to. It simply does not wash that the male is an automatically walking wallet even when the children have been removed from him against his will - simply because he had \textbf{sex}. It has also been a disaster for children and society. In the end these polices have been a failure and they encourage fatherlessness. In addition a growing number of the most responsible and valuable potential fathers are simply opting out altogether. Why would they agree to such a one sided interaction?you could go to court for many 10s of thousands of dollars and even if you stick through the whole process (the majority give up for good reason) 90 of fathers end up at best as visitors to their own children. Hence this is not achievable for the vast majority of fathers. I know a great deal about this and you are grossly naive to suggest that it's a realistic option. This is the same as telling jews in concentration camps that they can write a letter to Hilter. In any case why should a father have to waste most of his savings for a basic human right? No Sir this is no compensation for not providing men with reproductive rights. And you will find across family courts in western countries that 85 to 90plus percent of cases go against fathers. If you research this further you will find in every one of those countries that feminists and white knights have fought for decades to maintain this inequality against fathers. You will also find the majority of those working in the divorce industry trying to say the status quo is fine because it is a gold mine for them. Lawyers are the very last people you should ask about likely outcomes. They have a vested interest and have always fought in every country to maintain it. Why should a father even have to pay most of his savings for a 1 in 10 chance to maintain a relationship with his children? Because the entire system works to exclude him by default if the mother wants to exclude him. The lack of Fathers rights is a whole other reason why men should have reproductive rights. If she wants to exclude the father then the least she can do is fully fund her lifestyle choice herself. It's a parenting decision which should have direct consequences for her immediately.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Sex, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}10/1194 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.838 \\  \hline

I mean, it's basically a glove. How hard can it be to wear a GLOVE?!> forcing the father to pay so called child support is simply creating incentives to have fatherless child. Neither the tax payers nor people who dod not consent to having a child should pay. Wipe out those incentives and the number of fatherless children would plumet overnight. Everyone would be better off except for all those women expecting others to pay for their own lifestyle choices. Except that removing child support would mean that the breadwinner parents (usually fathers) would be completely free to leave their spouse and children without any economical support, for any reason, without any discouragement from doing so. (And the stay-at-home parent [usually mothers] couldn't get economical support independently because she was assigned the "natural role" of staying at home and take care of the children. Which makes pursuing a full-time high-pay career literally impossible because of the time costraints.)More importantly, they would be able to held the threat of divorce - and thus, of being left without any economical means to survive - to make the stay-at-home parent stay in the relationship by force. Does that look healthy? I don't think so. [LINK] > At what point did the father have any reproductive rights? The mother chooses to have the child.Again: condoms. Moreover, multiple States have laws that allows the fathers to completely disown a child before or right after it's born. They lose all visitation rights and all potesty over the kid, but also have no financial obligations towards him/her either. [LINK] Now, on to child custody and child support.> It is not the business of the government to make those parenting decisions.It is, if the couple doesn't find an agreement and/or if the kid's wellbeing is in danger.> Instead we have the government removing parenting decisions from one parent - the father - and giving all the decisions and choices to the other parent. False. Child custody (and thus, the right to receive child support from the other spouse) is usually given to the "primary care-giver", aka the parent who spent the most time with the kids, knows them the most and thus is the most fit to meet their needs. [LINK] > (a) first of all, men should have equal reproductive rights to women. They don't. Their accountability should be in proportion to their rights.The problem is that it presuppones that pregnancy has an equal effect to both genders. it doesn't. Have you actually seen a pregnant \textbf{woman}?> Also men should have equal reproductive options to women. They don't and probably never will.Currently available:- Condoms. Cheap, really effective, they prevent STDs as well as pregnancies, and you can decide when you want to use them and when not to any time you want. There's even latex-free ones, in case you're allergic.- Vasectomies. It's a permanent sterilization, so it shouldn't be choosed lightly. 100 effective against pregnancies, and with very few side effects compared to, say, tubal ligation.In development:- Ultrasound sterilizations. The experiments have been going since 2007, focusing on achieving durable non-permanent sterilization, instead of just having "a month" and "permanent". Besides that, it appears to have less-than-100 efficency but absolutely NO side effects if used properly. [LINK] - Male contraception pill. The reason it took so long for it is because they both had to find something that wasn't permanent, and to iron out all the side effects. [LINK] > you could go to court for many 10s of thousands of dollarsOne of the deciding factors for the amount of alimony/child support that has to be paid by the breadwinner parent is how much said parent makes. [LINK] and even if you stick through the whole process (the majority give up for good reason) 90 of fathers end up at best as visitors to their own children.The majority of couples (read: the 91) decided who got child custody on their own, without any interference from a family court. Of the remanining 9, 5 decided to go along with the court's initial evaluation of the couple; 2,5 went to a legal litigation, but then fell back to the initial court evaluation; and 1,5 were actually decided by a family court.And fathers have at least a 51 chance to get at least shared custody. This isn't just visitation rights, but also having a legal say over the kid. [LINK] > And you will find across family courts in western countries that 85 to 90plus percent of cases go against fathers.As I've said, only 9 of divorces are settled in family courts. Addictionally, if a divorce has got to the point where a family court is required, chances are, it wasn't a healthy situation to begin with. (Though which parent was the problematic one, if not both or neither, is an entirely different question.)> Why should a father even have to pay most of his savings for a 1 in 10 chance to maintain a relationship with his children?Because it's a 1 in 2 chance, not a 1 in 10.

Also, the sleeping with lots of girls: society pressures guys into "getting it" with as many girls as possible. Again though, that's not me. I would rather maintain a meaningful relationship with my girlfriend and only be with her. It feels so unfair because all these attributes that are associated with "being a man" just aren't who I am. I would like to be a man, but I want to be kind to girls, get along with everyone (not fight everyone), giving my girlfriend an equal say etc. If I do these things, all of a sudden I'm labeled as \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} or a \textbf{pussy}. Ummm, why? That, unfortanately, does hurt a lot of men's pride and feelings. So it's a vicious circle. Men want to act and feel somewhere inbetween those of a man and those of a \textbf{woman}. Yet if we do, we're now labeled as weak. Therefore, although many of us won't admit it, we submit to the peer pressure.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I feel the need to apologize for all the hate comments and morons telling you that you're stupid or don't know what you're talking about.

They're so used to the "normal" \textbf{gender} roles that they whine and complain when someone tries to make the \textbf{gender} roles abstract. To all the morons in the comments section who obviously have no idea what she's talking about: She is talking about making \textbf{gender} roles abstract, and making \textbf{gender} roles abstract is NOT THE SAME THING as eliminating \textbf{gender} roles entirely. Allowing abstract \textbf{gender} roles means that members of any \textbf{sex} can move around through all of the \textbf{gender} boxes according to their own personalities; basically, it's breaking the boxes apart and letting parts of people's personalities in or out according to who they want to be.  I personally agree with your video whole-heartedly, and I think you could use a confidence boost based on all of the horrible, unintelligent negative comments you're getting from people who haven't really thought about this and who are only here to complain and flip everything around on you because they don't really understand what feminism is about.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender, Sex & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}10/252 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.968 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I'd like to clarify an often mistaken idea about feminism. The purpose is to achieve \textbf{gender} EQUALITY. Not female superiority. Only it focuses more on \textbf{sexism} towards women because that is more dangerous. Women are physically weaker and for a long time in the history of the world they didn't have even close to the same rights as men. Not even close. And that is still going on, though in a more... subtle manner. OF COURSE there is such a thing as \textbf{sexism} against men but it is NOT feminism. Feminism fights for equal rights, not including, as i saw in a lot of comments, the idea that annoys men, that they are supposed to financially support a relationship, to buy gifts for a girl, to act tough, etc. It annoys women too! Because that affects both men AND women. In other words, feminism fights for the idea that we (all of us) should not be viewed as female/male but as person. \textbf{Gender} is not everything! So that means that feminism agrees with the concept that the guys shouldn't always be the ones who ask out on dates, pay for them, etc. Many people falsely believe that feminism fights for equal rights but still wants the luxuries brought by being "a girl". That is inaccurate. More guys should call themselves feminists because even though the name may cause confusion it is in fact the opposite of \textbf{sexism} not misogynism. Of course there are those people who go to the extremes claiming women are better than men. They are NOT feminists. I repeat, feminism only focuses more on the issues tied to women and girls because they are more grave at the time. For example, \textbf{nobody} calls guys cat names on the street (well maybe on some rare occasions), \textbf{nobody} comments about their man-boobs or the hair on their legs or face or tells them they should use makeup to look prettier, etc. As for rape, it happens more to girls, it isn't as often that you hear about the case of a boy being sexually assaulted as it is of a girl. But women and men both have problems when it comes to \textbf{sexism} and true feminists recognize that. Also, i'm not trying to generalize here, bravo to all those who do something about \textbf{gender} equality, not all men are misogynists and not all women hate men.

All I have to say to you is NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!! \textbf{SEXISM} IS ANY FORM OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST A PERSON OR PERSONS BASED ON \textbf{GENDER}!!!!!!! Not just against female \textbf{gender} but \textbf{gender} in general! Your whole video is sexist because you make the discrimination, that only women experience \textbf{SEXISM}! You are literally perpetuating \textbf{gender} discriminatory ideals!!!! You blame society for systematic \textbf{sexism}, but then claim that system is controlled by men, then you say that you aren't man haters you just hate the system but then you say the system is controlled by men, which means you do hate men! Then feminists say that \textbf{sexism} can't be done to men, yet we still experience it's affects, and since its men controlling the system that is sexist than men are at fault for the whole freaking problem including our own!!!!!! This is ludicrous, if the \textbf{patriarchy} still exists why would we make a system that hurts us????!!!!!! It's insane! So how is feminism the answer???? When a human rights movement accomplishes its goals and doesn't dissipate, it's stops being a movement and becomes a political party!!! You feminists have gone from a movement about equality to a political party pressing for female advancement! Not equality advancement, of your ideals!!! No you don't run for government, but neither did the Bolsheviks, they used others already in politics to stage a coup which led to civil war!!! if you take human rights at its current point you will find that the areas where women are more equal out number the areas that men are more equal! I don't call being left out of combat roles in the military so that you won't be blown up oppression, I call that female privilege. I don't call getting up to 65 of a man's assets in alimony and child care checks even if you make more annually than your ex husband, inequality, I call that privilege. I don't call having mutually consensual \textbf{sex} with a man,  conceiving a child that he is 50 responsible for conceiving, and yet he has no reproductive right in deciding whether to keep the child alive or not, equality, it's female privilege. I don't call laws against female genital mutilation, and none for men, especially when it's most often women deciding whether the circumcision takes place or not, equality, it's female privilege. I don't call 100s of millions of dollars spent on female violence crisis centres, treatment centres and research but almost none if any, existing for men, equality, that's female privilege. I don't call women receiving as much 50 less in sentencing for equal crimes, than their male counter parts equality, that's female privilege. Should I go on? Because there is more! And don't give me that crap about society's expectation, most of that is our biology, it is biologically engrained in almost every man to vie for alpha male status, some men realize early that they aren't alphas so they take submissive life paths, others don't. You feminists always talk about trans and \textbf{q\textbf{ueer}} people being born that way, and that it's ok and good! But men's natural state is bad because you don't like it!!!!! Sure we can rise above our biology, become more, but how high do feminists want to go, higher than men surely. The feminist movement is beginning to push for women's prisons to close and for alternative rehabilitation methods to be used for women only!!! Stating that women criminals should not be treated as male criminals!!!!!! What the hell, so you want equality as long as it's nice and sounds good? What a load of princess excrement!!

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I don't think it has much to do with "not being a \textbf{woman}," but instead fitting a specified \textbf{gender} role. A \textbf{woman} who identifies as a man or holds masculine traits is seen as lesser because she refuses to remain in her preset identity that society has created for her. Under your concept of masculinity, women should be paraded for acting like men. We should have Tom Boys everywhere. No \textbf{woman} would want to act like a \textbf{woman}. But women still act like women, and rightfully take pride in it. Why? Not conforming to that identity would create an imbalance that society doesn't like. When a man is \textbf{g\textbf{ay}}, he's seen has upsetting the balance because he biologically has value as a male with sperm. Same with Lesbians (but with eggs, and a womb). From an evolutionary perspective, people staying within their \textbf{gender} roles is important for the survival of the species. Of course, this is the modern \textbf{age}, and we don't need to rely on such primal principles. I don't think masculinity is a firm "anti-female" characteristic, but instead a completely separate characteristic that just so happens to contrast femininity as a function of evolution.

What?besides, from a purely survivalistic viewpoint, killing rivals is productive, because it means that more females are available for your offspring.Also, if a man crying is considered normal by everyone, can you explain why people call him "\textbf{pansy}" or "wimpy" - basically calling him a \textbf{woman} for crying?

But men don't have a psychological inability to cry, just like women don't have a psychological propensity to cry.We just know what will happen when we cry.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Did people really not get the point of this video? Feminism helps men because it is saying that the "feminine" traits are the ones that need to be accepted and acceptable for everyone, men and women. Accepting these so-called "feminine" stereotypes in men will help eliminate a lot of the \textbf{sexism} men face. Accepting "feminine" traits in men will help ease the harmful \textbf{gender} roles men are pressured to adhere to everyday, such as not allowing to show emotion, having less priority in a custody battle, being belittled or not believed for being raped, etc. Realizing that these so-called "feminine" traits aren't negative traits, even in men, can alleviate harmful \textbf{sexism} against men. It is the \textbf{patriarchy} the sets forth these harmful stereotypes by saying that everyone with a penis needs to be "manly, athletic, big, muscular, tall, etc", because being like a girl is "bad, \textbf{dumb}, weak, etc", which simply isn't true. Remember when girls would pride themselves on "not being like other girls"? And how it was okay for a girl to be a "\textbf{tomboy}"? That it's okay for a girl to play sports but \textbf{weird} for a man to do something like ballet? That showing emotion means you're "\textbf{crazy}"? That men think Taylor Swift is "\textbf{psycho}" for writing songs about her love life but girls think Ed Sheeran and Bruno Mars are sweet and sensitive for writing about theirs? It's the \textbf{patriarchy} that says men need to be the opposite of women because being "feminine" is bad and demeaning, which again, isn't true. Getting rid of \textbf{gender} stereotypes and \textbf{gender} roles can effect everyone, men and women, positively.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small There is \textbf{nothing} wrong for a man to have masculinity. It just depends on how you use it. Most men will use their masculinity to become the protector and provider for their future families. It's all written in our genetic code. Masculinity and femininity were NOT social constructs. Our roles were given specifically by mother nature herself based on our biological characteristics. It just so happens that society and our culture used these characteristics to further the human population. Men's bodies were design to hunt and provide while the women's bodies were made to give birth and nurture. What disappoints me about feminism is how they fail to realize that nature gave BOTH men and women a purpose.A \textbf{woman} is not suppose to act like a man while a man is not suppose to act like a \textbf{woman}. When society tells a boy that he "throws like a girl" it does MEAN mean that society was being sexist towards women. Society thought that women were physically weak and that their place was to give birth and nurture their children which,again, was not a social construct but a characteristic that nature demanded. Yes, men are pressured to be masculine but only because it is their duty to become so for the sake of their future. In fact, we are pressured to become better everyday. There is \textbf{nothing} wrong to have a little push once in a while, it just builds character. Personally, I don't have too much respect for men who are weak and can't pull off their own weight. The result of teaching these men that they should only be feminine only resulted with them being confused about their own identity and wonder why they couldn't attract a mate. Women secretly want a man who holds masculine traits and there is \textbf{nothing} that feminism can do to change that fact. What I also find out is that we need BOTH masculinity and femininity to balance things out. A man can hold some feminine traits to care for his family and friends while a \textbf{woman} can hold some masculine traits to protect her family and friends as well. The way I see it, both genders can hold both masculine AND feminine traits. Men and women need each other. We are the yin and yang of this world and we are what keeps it balance.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The vast majority of the things you list that men feel pressured to be/do is selective mating pressure from women, I think you'll find. Men feel pressure to be stronger, taller and be the breadwinner because traditionally that is what women have mated with and sexually selected against for breeding.This is just evolution at work, women play the selective role in the mating game, men are on average far more sexually \textbf{promiscuous} by nature (an observable fact) and women are sexually selective because women have to nurture a child it's a huge burden which means choosing carefully. Men however can father as many children as they like with little to no risk or burden on themselves.This is a classic example of women not knowing that they're the cause of the problems they want to get rid of. If you REALLY want to get rid of those pressures for men then start dating short, weedy men with no muscles and can't earn a decent wage, etc etc.Until then your own behaviour and selection preference in men will drive what men compete with each other on and define social norms.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Promiscuous & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - Female sexuality & \cellcolor{green!5}1/191 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.524 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small My older brother knew somebody who had 2 children, a boy and an older sister to the boy. Now, he told me he was there when both were growing up, the girl was 9 and the boy was 6 when i visited. He told me he noticed a difference of personality by the father when looking after both children. He would treat the girl and still does as his little princess, bought her everything, when she made a mistake he hardly would shout at all, now this is different to how he would treat the boy. He would treat the boy as he was just a second child, like he was a boy who was expected to carry the world on his little shoulders and there was a sharp contrast as to how they would be treated, the father was basically shit to the boy. Once my brother left i'm guessing this carried on till teenage years, since my brother heard the boy left when he was about 21 years \textbf{old} and the \textbf{elder} sister stayed. The boy couldn't find a job, so he went into drugs and a few years ago he was shot dead after he tried to be brave and interfere in his girlfriends issues by stepping in when she was having an argument with her ex who was another drug dealer. My brother said he doesn't know what happened to the sister. I'm not sure if the cause of his death was the result of bad parenting.However, i do know many parents or fathers to be precise who favour the girls over the boys no matter what \textbf{age}. In my opinion, this needs to change. Who knows if the boy would have been treated equally to the girl then maybe he would have had a better life. People need to stop being overprotective of females, or rather than that which sounds extremely sexist (I'm sorry if it does), make sure children are treated the exact same, especially siblings of around the same \textbf{age}. I personally hate the idea of how men have to be overprotective of women all the time. I especially hate the type of men who protect their little sisters, especially when their little sisters start some sort of a fight. I have two older sisters, the oldest being 4 years older than me, if they were in trouble i would help them no doubt, however if they were in trouble and they started it, then they should know that there is some sort of consequence. The thing i hate the most is \textbf{gender} favouritism in children, i've seen some articles from women who have written things like why they would prefer daughters. In fact i have seen one specific article from a \textbf{woman} who wrote how she loved having a daughter and now how she is going to hate having a son. This really irritates me.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Elder, Gender, Old, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}6/484 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.24 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small This is pretty stupid... Why do women apply female norms and say it is ok for men? Example.. it should be ok for men to sit with their legs crossed.. However, this can be uncomfortable for men because of testicles. Yet women would argue that sitting that way should be fine. Yet they dont have testies.. It should be ok for men to pee sitting down.. When most men are comfortable peeing standing up? If the guy makes a mess.. Just Clean It UP! problem solved..Men dont normally show emotions because it does not fix problems! Crying because I lost my job does \textbf{nothing}. Going to find another job does. Being tall or strong, liking sports.. News flash.. There are guys who arent tall, strong or into sports. Have we kicked them out of the country? Most men do not have problems with expectations for being a man. Being known to be the protector has more to do with being physically stronger than women.. And due to the fact most women CAN NOT protect a man.. expecially against another man. How many women are claiming to want to protect a man?? Even the strongest \textbf{woman} in the world isnt as strong as an avg man. The avg \textbf{woman} is 5'4.. avg man 5'9.. Women generally produce 2/3 the strenght of men.More so, just with the example of a \textbf{woman} carrying a child.. Is she suppose to protect the child, herself.. and a man? Men for centuries have accepted these roles. Just like most parents acceept responsibilities concerning children in their care. We only question \textbf{gender} roles because feminism says its wrong.. Until they benefit.. Open your own doors and pay for your own dates.. Ask men out and stop telling men how to be men..

What a stupid fucking question. She literally took things that weren't even problems against girls and turned them into exactly that. "I'm big and strong! Unlike women..." said no fucking guy EVER. Are guys allowed to want to be...guys, anymore? Are we not allowed to be muscular? I'm a pretty toned guy \& enjoy working out, I pride myself in my size and strength. Am I sexist?

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I think you are overcomplicating it, and when you start talking about male standards and \textbf{sexism} against men, and relate it back to women, it makes me think you only care about it in the sense that it affects women. Sorry, not everything links back to oppressing women.. \textbf{sexism} by women against men primarily affects the men, not women. \textbf{Sexism} can be, but is not necessarily, as you defined it: the actual definition of \textbf{sexism} is below.\textbf{Sexism} - n. unfair treatment of people because of their \textbf{sex}So any sort of prejudicial action or behavior against anyone of any \textbf{sex} simply because they are that \textbf{sex}, is sexist.

Don't undermine the \textbf{sexism} men sometimes have to put up with by always making it about women, because it's just not always the case.Another thing: when you say that standards for MEN are meant to set them apart from GIRLS, how do you know this for certain? When I was taught how to "be a man", it wasn't a misogynistic context. It wasn't "women are weak and you have to be strong to protect them", it was "Boys are weak, you're growing up, you have to be strong and be a man." I think a lot of the male stereotype role that fathers teach their sons is less about putting women down and more about teaching adolescent males the differences in behavior between a child and an adult.Reminds me of a quote from a play I saw last week called "Jersey Boys" (about Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons)"Walk Like a Man""As opposed to what, a girl?""No, as opposed to a BOY."\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Sex, Sexism, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}11/313 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.514 \\  \hline

(I'll give you hint here. It's so they can retain the entitlements that women had while adhering to the \textbf{old} \textbf{sex} roles (e.g. free drinks, free dinners, free diamond rings, etc. ) Women love \textbf{sexism} as long as it works for them.Ask your brother what would happen when he is not "chivalrous" toward women.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I'm sorry, but feminism does not deal with \textbf{sexism} against men. Maybe a few feminists do focus a little bit on \textbf{sexism} against men, but the feminist movement itself does NOT focus on the \textbf{sexism} men face.And when feminists do address \textbf{sexism} against men on their behalf, they tend to focus on how men are discouraged from having "feminine" characteristics or how men are encouraged to have more "masculine" characteristics. Though there is some truth here, it's flooded with a lot of bullshit. Let's go down the list of stereotypes Laci mentions.Laci gets a star (*) for each stereotype that's true and sensible.1. Pressure to be physically tall.- Pretty sure you're wrong about this one.*2. Pressure to be physically strong.- This one is actually somewhat true. But it's not a very serious issue.3. To push down feelings.- Men tend to handle emotional problems different than women, which causes this false stereotype to present itself. Truth be told, both men and women tend to hold back their feelings, which is the cause of many relationship issues we see around us. No star.*4. To never cry.- I'll give you this one, though it's not a very serious issue.5. Pressure to be into sports or into manly hobbies.- I can't give you a star for this one because not only are women encouraged to play sports as well, but you're way too vague about what "manly hobbies" are. And, to be honest, I've never had anyone give me a hard time for lacking interest in sports. I've never seen this either. But I did play sports in grade school because my parents felt I should be more active - woop de do.6. To use violence or intimidation to solve problems.- This is only true in some local cultures. The vast majority of men are taught to handle problems in a reasonable manner. The only exception is when it comes to using violence when violence is first initiated against one's self. Generally, men who are taught to be tough and use violence to solve non-violence problems come from corrupt neighborhoods or corrupt families in which there's an even bigger issue than \textbf{sexism} that exists - these people tend to need a complete behavior overhaul.**7. Prove manhood by having lots of \textbf{sex}.- I'll give you this one since there is a stigma against men who seem to get little to no action. This one is actually mildly serious when it comes to self esteem, good job.8. Learning to see women as \textbf{sex} objects.- The overwhelmingly vast majority of men do not view women as mere \textbf{sex} objects. There are men out there who do though, but every single time someone uses this argument, it's targeted towards all men who want \textbf{sex}. Because of this, no fucking stars. This "\textbf{sex} objects" claim is absolute bogus and I even remember Laci quoting a biased study in which a \textbf{woman} measured how a person PHYSICALLY looks at women compared to men to determine how they VALUE men and women - a very dishonest tactic that proved fuckall. This merits negative stars, but I'll be generous.9. Pressure to be one of the guys, to make "harmless jabs" at each other.- This really isn't an issue at all. Bullying, in which the jabs are meant to hurt feelings, is a real problem. But when friends give each other crap, it's usually harmless. Sometimes, people go overboard, but this isn't a sexist issue - it's a very minor issue in which someone doesn't know when to stop. More importantly, it's \textbf{common} for men and women to take jabs at each other. This is a non-issue.10. To be the protector in the relationship and never the protected.- Feminists are against women being raised to be "protected" by their loved ones, but all of a sudden men should be raised to be "protected"? Reality check, we should raise both men and women to protect each other in whichever ways possible. And guess what, men generally are physically stronger than their female counter parts - it's genetics. But at the same time, women tend to be better at handling emotional stress, which is something they're often taught to do when it comes to relationships. That's not to say the roles can't or should not be reversed, but this is generally what happens due to genetics. Not only do you have to deal with this fact, but we should encourage confident men who want to protect their loved ones. That's a GOOD thing.**11. To be the bread winner.-  I'm giving you a point here because often men are the ones portrayed as having to be work oriented whereas the \textbf{woman} be more family oriented. This does have real life complications as well.12. To be the handy-man, the money manager.- True, but these are such trivial critiques that it's a non-issue. Complaining about this is like bawling your eyes out because someone called you a "poop face". Yes, men generally are encouraged to be the handy-men and money mangers, but very rarely are they ever given crap when they aren't. It just isn't an issue. This doesn't even warrant a single star.13. To pursue physically demanding, dangerous, or even violent jobs.- The reason men tend to be encouraged to partake in these types of jobs is because these are the types of jobs men are generally more willing to do, if not more interested in doing. This isn't the result of \textbf{sexism}, it's simply a combination of men's behavior and physical build. It's called \textbf{sexual} dimorphism. That said, many men aren't interested in these types of jobs and pursue more white-collar jobs.14. Pressure to be the leader and to always have the answers.- Just because you feel like women are discouraged from being leaders doesn't mean we should suddenly stop encouraging men to be leaders. Both men and women should be encouraged to be leaders. You actually referenced "ban bossy" in one of your other videos, which we all know ban bossy is absolute horse shit. Both men and women are referred to as bossy when they act bossy. Fucking deal with it.So, Laci made about 14 points. Two of those points were fairly trivial but should be addressed. Two more of those points are actual issues that bear attention. The other 10 points were either completely wrong or so trivial that they're practically non-issues.** **I will admit, Lacy actually brings up a good point about men who are raped. Men who are raped are vastly unsupported. Even though it didn't make it into her initial list, she gets a star. She also gets a star for bringing up men who can't get custody of their children.She then talks about how gays are stereotyped for being feminine. No, it's because they're \textbf{g\textbf{ay}}. It's still an issue, but Laci added the "anti-\textbf{woman}" swing on there to further victimize women.Laci claims \textbf{transgender} people are more likely to be victims of violence than non-\textbf{transgender} people. The problem I have with this claim is that the source comes from an obviously biased site - but it could be a legitimate claim. I won't give or knock any points on this one since it's something I'll have to look into. (Violence against trans-gender people, as well as anyone else, is wrong - but we need to use accurate information).I really did nitpick a lot. For the most part, this video has a good... an alright... message. But NONE OF THIS IS HAS TO DO WITH FEMINISM. Feminism, at its best, deals with equality of women to men. It does not deal with equality in general. That's what egalitarianism is for. Feminism is simply a sub-group... and that's being generous since most outspoken feminists are outright sexist against men or they make up bullshit facts to victimize women.Men are abused and used, but is this kind of \textbf{sexism} addressed? Of course not, feminists tend to focus on \textbf{sexism} against feminine men.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Common, Gay, Sex, Sexism, Sexual, Transgender, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General, Sexual Identity - General, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality, Sexual Identity - Transexuality, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}20/1355 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.476 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small So, what I got from this was that you made it sound like it's \textbf{sexism} for men, but then go, "nope, still a \textbf{woman} problem, since they say that it's bad for a man to be compared to a \textbf{woman}!"\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Sexism, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/40 & \cellcolor{green!27}7.5 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Can I say something? Of course I can this is the internet you can say whatever you want no matter how stupid it is.. that might explain this video but I digress. The idea that men suppress or "hide away" their emotions is entirely void. Men are less expressive with their emotions and they, as a fact of their psychology, are more emotionally stable. When a man cries something is seriously wrong; his children have died, he's lost his job, he's dying something is really wrong. The reason that men cry less often is because there is less that makes them cry. They of course experience pain and hurt the same as women do which is why women view men as suppressing their emotions because they don't express them the same way. It's a very female centric view of the world if you think about it.Most of this video can be attributed to this young women's basic misunderstanding of males and their \textbf{mental} states or they are complete fabrications.Speaking of fabrications there is her definition of the word \textbf{sexism}. She essentially changes the definition of the word that is in every dictionary so that it can only be applied to the suppression of females or the qualities that feminists deign to be called feminine. This makes it impossible for \textbf{sexism} to perpetrated on any ground but her own essentially using it as a tool for her argument. Unfortunately however anything built on a lie must eventually fall so I hope that her fall from prominence come quickly and that she has no lasting impact on any young impressionables unable to see reason.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Mental, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}3/274 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.095 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small It is true that boys and girls are different at birth. We do experience emotions somewhat in a same way, but we express them differently; girls and boys I mean. And there is \textbf{nothing} wrong with this, it is simply a biological or should I say, neurological truth. There are over 100 recorded neurological differences in our brains between the genders. And it does show when we look at males and females.Children as young as few hours have already been recorded to have different traits in behavior. For example newborn male babies tend to look at their surroundings and objects, such as the wall clock wheres for example newborn girl babies tend to look at the human being that is holding them in their arms.We are different that much is true. But difference does not have to be a bad thing. In fact it is part of the strength of human species. I think that it is important to embrace those differences as one \textbf{gender} is no better than the other, just different and that is about it. I don't understand why and where the notion that because we are different, it somehow means one is superior and the other one is inferior.﻿Now does \textbf{sexism} hurt men too? Of course it does. If we want to solve these issues then things like \textbf{sexism} applies universally to both men and women of all \textbf{ethnic} origin.It is why I oppose the approach of Feminism because it is contradicting to the goals it claims to fight against. You can not solve the issue of \textbf{sexism} is you are going to be sexist towards someone else. It is merely just relocating the issue of \textbf{sexism} to another location.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Here is a matter to consider, doesn't it seem obvious that by making ourselves lose the stereotypes for men and women, we lose a lot of the personal feeling of necessity. A man (which I am) feels that he must (is necessary to) be masculine. This gives him something fundamental to achieve, and therefore, be proud of. If \textbf{nothing} is expected of him, he has \textbf{nothing} to prove. And the reality is, we want to have something to prove, even though it makes us feel uncomfortable, inadequate or such. If a man was not expected to be masculine, he might not be masculine. But being held beneath expectations, provides responsibility. If he is required to be masculine, he will feel some level of a duty to be so. If he succeeds, he may feel accomplishment (good, right?). If he fails, we all know how it goes.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The idiocy in this ideal is horrendous. Equality is possible in different ways. It's not actually possible to have equality in the way in which feminists want it. I love how they talk about not using anger, violence and aggression and how they are negative traits. Women whilst do having testosterone have around 10 times less testosterone levels in their bodies so how the fuck would they know how to handle it to the same degree as a man or even comment on it within a negative light. By all means you have a right to, but it's got about as much respect as me telling you to "man up because periods aren't that bad". \textbf{Sexual} dimorphism is a real thing and feminists tend to forget this. Without the traits of both sexes in their most stereotypical roles we would not have a large proportion of the 'free world' that we do today.Feminists can have a very positive role in the world in which we live in, although by doing that you will no longer be a feminist, but in turn be a \textbf{woman}'s rights activist. (as much as positive as a word is completely subjective word). What you guys (<-- sorry by using the word "guys" am i making your blood boil like the word bossy, i don't care) really need to start doing, is stop focusing on your completely minor problems in the so called 'free world' and start focusing on serious women rights violations that happen across the planet on a daily basis. The \textbf{patriarchy} in the western world isn't a problem in comparison to girls getting married of at 9, and dying from internal injuries on the night of their marriage due to consummating it. Having words like bossy as a problem is slapping the illegal female \textbf{sex} slave trade in the face!Stop undermining your cause by picking at the minor details in THE BEST POSSIBLE LIFE ANY \textbf{WOMAN} OR MAN CAN HAVE ON THIS PLANET AT THIS POINT IN HISTORY LIVING IN THE WESTERN WORLD. Stop saying you're oppressed because you're not, its audacious to say the least. Focus on real issues and stop looking like self centred typical westerners . Yes i acknowledge that the person in this video has previously highlighted that some of the points i have raised as real problems she has a problem with too. But within the 50 reasons she states as to why she is a feminists gasp (yawn), she only slightly touches on the more serious issues where real rights are being violated. I would also like to point out that whilst hating the patriarchal society in which you live in and want to change it. It has produced everything that you have ever enjoyed loved or liked and as an added bonus you then cherry pick the parts that you want to keep such as makeup which are a direct result of previous \textbf{sexism} and oppression and the overall undermining on women. All the while calling yourself free and independent and fighting against the supposed "oppression". It's completely warped and fucked up. Please actually wake up and look at statistics that show in every area of life for a female in the western world it is getting more equal by the day without fully retarded videos such as this (which i can see some people accrediting to a movement that was already happening). I respect women who i feel deserve respect just the same as men. Pop culture and radical feminists in my opinion do not deserve my respect and i am sorry for wasting your time.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I do agree that men are pressured in these regards.  But, at the end of the day, you are only pressured as much as you allow yourself to be.  Toughen up, ask yourself "Why do I give a fuck what a shitty person is pressuring me into/belittling me on? Are they correct, and if so, is there anything I can do to improve this?"  Problem solved.  No further need to get butthurt about anything.Also, power, and aggression are not bad traits.  They only are if you are physically violent in a non self defense scenario, or a non sporting scenario.  As a whole, men and women earn promotions at their jobs, gain affluence, gain more relationships, and get further in life by having power, and by risk taking aggressive behavior.By the way, the argument that men aren't supposed to cry is invalid.  Plenty of tough guys cry, dads, anyone in sports, military, we all understand at this point that it is human.  You'd have to find one seriously outdated human in order to hear someone say men should not cry.  This is basically a non-issue at this point, but not impossible.  You're grasping for straws at this point.By the way, feminists are to blame for men not being seen as nurturing and essential to a family.  Feminism normalized and made accepted pre-marital \textbf{sex}, which in turn meant that it was not a 1:1 ratio of people in a relationship having \textbf{sex}.  People are free to have \textbf{sex} out of marriage.  This led to the most desirable men getting a lot more than one \textbf{woman}, leaving the least desirables of both sexes to a lot of frustration and lack of fulfillment.  The percentage of unsatisfied, and likely virgins is higher in men than in women, but it is certainly present in women as well.  Any quick look at some of the tumblrinas will show you a  large cross section of those unsatisfied women, and to a lesser extent, men.I'm incredibly surprised you did not mention the fact that men don't get the same autonomy of their bodies as women do.  Seeing as men are often circumcised at birth, and women aren't.  You've spoken out about circumcision before though, so I will assume you either forgot about it, or didn't consider that viewpoint. We also do not get the same reproductive rights as you.  Not nearly.  No male birth control, (condoms do not count), abortion is ultimately your decision regardless of what the father has to say about it, (again, largely due to the dissolution of the family unit, thanks feminism), custody battles are often completely lopsided in favor of the \textbf{woman}, and in California and one other state, (I believe it is Montana if memory serves), a \textbf{woman} can claim a man as father of her child, and he has 30 days to prove it is not his.  If he does not prove that within that time period, he cannot appeal.  There's also the rape laws feminists have fought for, where only the penetrator, (AKA the one with the penis), can be the raper.  And then there is also the issue of women get much lesser sentences for the same crimes, as well as women openly making jokes against men who have had their genitals mutilated by crazy/vengeful lovers, as well as mocking male rape.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Sex, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}6/558 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.075 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Hey everyone. I'm a Libertarian Feminist. I'm also an MRA. Here's why people hate Feminism.The narrative promoted by many Feminist campaigners in the modern \textbf{age} is largely directed AGAINST men, blaming them for every petty First-World problem, manspreading, manslamming, catcalls and the like (all of which are social behaviours, not \textbf{gender} issues). In addition, most so-called Feminist literature, revered by Feminist academics, and the main basis of modern feminist theory, is steeped in \textbf{misandry}, and was written by those with extremist views ('Kill all men' Solanos, 'All \textbf{sex} is rape' Dworkin and the like). These are the same people who ruined Erin Pizzey's life (the founder of women's shelters), because she dared to say that women could be violent too, and tried to set up another shelter for men. As most men also point out, modern Feminism also seems to turn a \textbf{blind} eye to genuine mistreatment of women, be it the \textbf{sexual} abuse of 1400 young girls in my country over 16 years (feminist party covered it all up, and feminist movement turned a \textbf{blind} eye when it was exposed), China aborting female babies en masse, women in the Middle East being executed for being rape victims and so on. Modern feminism is NEVER there for those women. It's not the ideology that's the problem, it's those with influence that claim to speak on your behalf.In MY country, feminists whine when we prosecute false rape accusers, feminists whine when we point the finger at them and asked why they didn't care about 1400 abused girls under their watch, feminists condone and revel in the suffering of men, feminists label an organisation aiming to gain rights for divorced fathers a 'terrorist group', feminists put a known man-hater in the Equalities Minister position, from where she wages war on the rights of fathers over a 10 year period. Feminists also lobby against rights for divorced fathers (think NOW).Your movement hasn't always possessed a man-hating narrative, but since roughly 1970 it has done. Why is this? If you ever want feminism to be seen as a credible movement again, you need to seize back control from the extremists.\textbf{Gender} equality requires BOTH Feminism and the MRM, and both sides need an equal say, but this cannot happen if Feminism refuses to acknowledge it's been hijacked. We have the SAME goals, but we cannot work together if your movement promotes hatred.Oh, and as a fun challenge for feminists, find me influential MALE scholars who have advocated exterminating ALL women, a la Valerie Solanos.If you wish to know more about the MRM or MGTOW, just ask!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Blind, Gender, Misandry, Sex, Sexual & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}8/436 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.835 \\  \hline

Ask a feminist if they believe women should always get custody, they'll say no. Ask an MRA the same question and they'll say women should get back in the kitchen or else they deserved to be raped.Sure, protest circumcision.

[LINK] At any given time, the top scoring links are "feminism this, feminism that". yet all the issues you raised to me predate feminism. In other words, they're more focused on destroying the image of feminism than they are tackling any real issues men have, whilst feminists like Laci are tackling issues for both genders.Evidently, you're an MRA. I'm going to assume you have no problem identifying as such, but you probably don't identify as a feminist.In an MRA's mind, the leader of the MRM can call rape victims conniving stupid bitches and it's "no big deal, the movement is still mostly good" yet when 2 or 3 feminists complain about a shirt being sexist, the whole movement is corrupt and we're all "man hating nazis."\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Misogynist, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/196 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.02 \\  \hline

Can you imagine the uproar if Laci claimed "I'm a female right's advocate and I'm anti-men." How is that any different?How is the 1 in 3 campaugn related to the MRM? When I Googled it, it's about women who had abortions."On college campuses men's rights groups are meeting, it's a small movement we don't have authority figures in the public view."What, did this happen like once or twice? What did they do for men? \textbf{Nothing}."I understand that reddit is a community and stuff but in the end it's still social media..."It's the largest hub of MRAs. You can't play the "the leader sucks, but the majority is good!" game then discredit the majority as "just social media.""But in the end men are killing themselves and whilst I am happy to see this being acknowledged by feminists today, men don't get funding to actually find out the root cause, at the moment the biggest influence on male suicide rate is divorce, and the government won't finance research into it."The research was done already. It has been repeatedly found in studies that women are in fact far more likely to suffer depression and try to kill themselves. The difference in actual execution lies in the method of choice; more often men have access to guns and opt for more assured methods, whereas females typically survive or are discovered before death (often using pills.) But of course, higher rates of depression in females is no biggie. It's only an issue when men commit suicide more often."I don't think feminism is full of man-hating matriarchal psychos. I just feel as though it doesn't view the issues of men as comparable to women."So instead you support a movement that outright exists to ignore women's issues, attack those who try to mention them, and further only men's social inequities?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@A really good person "She's not anit-women she's anti-feminism."Exactly. She's pro men's rights, anti women's rights. Once again, imagine the uproar if the \textbf{gender} was switched: "I'm a feminist. Anti-men's rights." There would be death threats everywhere. Laci already gets death threats for absolutely no reason other than she wants the world to be a better place."What is the MRM meant to do other than raise awareness and donate to things like men's shelters?"I already told you, to complain about feminism, act like most rape accusers are liars, and call women who are sexually assaulted conniving stupid bitches. If the MRM wanted awareness, they would support feminists like Laci who has a huge following and hosts a TV show that she fights for both genders with. But the reason they don't is because to the MRM, women's issues MUST be ignored at the same time men's are acknowledged. Hence why 90 of MRA propaganda is first "antifeminist" before it's "pro men"."I will discredit any movement of reddit tbh, I get none of my information on anything from there."Well then you're discrediting the majority of the movement you're arguing in favor of. That makes no sense, tbh. You're advocating for a movement that causes more harm than good because that harm is not done to you. "It's an issue in females of course, that's why depressed females get prescribed anti-depressants at a higher rate. I find it insulting for you to assume that I don't care about a disorder that has affected my entire family, both men and women btw."Why is it then that the MRM never talks about female depression at a higher rate, talks about male suicide as the real issue, and chooses to ignore studies explicitly stating that the higher rate is attributed to methods not level of suffering? I don't understand how you can be insulted by me assuming you're one sided considering you're supportive of one sided \textbf{gender} movements."Pills take a long time to kick in this is why men and women use that method as they want a change in circumstance but cannot express it in a meaningful way (trust me I've been there). "You're choosing to ignore research to suit your agenda. The statistics say female depression is far more \textbf{common} than male. The conclusion was just the access to firearms and method of choice leads to higher male suicides. If one \textbf{gender} is more often depressed than the other, why do you discard this studied fact and replace it with your own hypothesis? The higher depression rate in females suggests, if anything, that females suffer more social issues than men. How you can claim the opposite really makes no sense."Feminism claims to be about equality but focuses more on the issues of women with the hope of improving lives for all. The MRM claims to be about Male issues and focus mostly on men only with the hope of improving life for all."Correction- feminism claims to be about equality and often is. It focuses more on women because since the beginning of time, females have been the main targets of \textbf{sexism}. It seeks to improve life for all. The MRM claims to be about male issues and is exclusively for men's issues, with the added bonus of discrediting women's issues and victim blaming. It does not seek to improve life for all, it seeks to improve life for men."Hence feminism marginalizes the issues faced by men."You're commenting this on a video of a feminist that fights for men, so no, not really. Once again, if marginalizing issues faced by one side is wrong to you, the MRM does that more often than feminism so what you're saying makes no sense.Where in that source did it state men were not getting equal funding for suicide prevention?\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Common, Gender, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}5/645 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.775 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@boomerthoreau You know that men are more likely to successfully kill themselves, but you don't think that they should be helped or acknowledged  because women get depressed more. Yep that's totally equality. You know why MRAs hate feminists? It's because feminists marginalize men's problems because, according to feminists "men are the majority in power and therefore don't need any help." Then a feminist will hear the words "men's rights activist" and assume it refers to patriarchal rights and not human rights. They then proceed to treat MRAs like the scum of the earth because they've waited their entire lives looking for a \textbf{misogynist} "women to the kitchen" straw man to become reality.And there is legitimate reason to dislike feminists because of what some feminists do. Feminists hear about men's rights issues and assume that feminism helps with that, while some feminists try they are outnumbered by the feminists that don't give a damn if a man has legitimate problems with discrimination because "it's just one man" when they hear about them. Do you know of a way to get a group that in general has an apathy for men and are only bonded by their love for women's rights to actually en mass try to fix men's problems? No? Then why should someone support or be part of a group that puts them in the back of the buss?

From the people who have taught me what feminism is, I have always learned that it is about mutual respect and peaceful living between man and women- and I think that is what most feminists stand for, not the whole man-blaming or man-hating thing, because we are all aware that without men we can't survive!

As human beings we tend to "fill" the gaps in our modern communities to keep them from falling apart. Men throughout history have been fulfilling most of the production of commodities and the providence of security for the their communities, while women have the ability to bear children (Future Men and Women) tend to care and raise those future generations. Products do not appear on the shelves magically. They are carried and transported by "Big Strong Men". Skyscrapers and malls that you enjoy did not emerge from the earth. They were built by those "Stereotypical" strong men who adapted to their communities needs for construction workers.If all men never acted based on their genetic structure and acted solely on the social aspects of society, the whole human \textbf{race} would fall apart.

When a man is weak, or sensitive, or small, or whatever he isn't demeaned for being like women, he is demeaned for not being like a man. What's the difference? Humans are naturally competitive, which is demonstrated easily using evolution. The more competitive a species, the more likely it's survival. So men look at alpha males as the example of how to be male because we are competitive and alpha males are more likely to succeed in the handful of markers that we call success. The more a male differs from alpha's the less manly he is considered. This, however, does not equate him with women, because women use different markers to define success. The worst part with Laci's objective with this video, is that it attempts to minimize what makes men special. Men are special because we are fast and strong and insensitive, and by saying that those shouldn't be admired, she is saying that the uniqueness of men shouldn't be valued.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/172 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.581 \\  \hline

Nationalsocialist Germany and Socialist Russia have developed cloning in 30s/40s, I would honestly be surprised if American government agencies haven't by now. \textbf{Sexual} intercourse is either for Liberals to complain about getting temporary pleasure or conservatives to complain about getting young, new, fresh soldiers for battle.

Feminists complain about pay gaps when men die in 90+ of work place fatalities, pay child support, and alimony.Feminists are telling men that its ok to be emotional, but when we express our feelings about feminism we are called misogynists. Feminists say that it is perfectly acceptable for the man to stay home and take care of the children, but in the majority of custody cases women are chosen for primary custody. Feminism is calling all men Rapists and Misogynists.Feminists says that the insults Cunt and \textbf{Pussy} is sexist, yet I've been called a Dick and an Asshole by feminists on multiple occasions. We are told to treat women like equals, but are expected to pay for dates.We are told women are equals, but you are not allowed to defend yourself from a \textbf{woman} for fear of committing domestic abuse.We are expected to make the first "move", but must ask for consent for fear of being a rapist.We are the ones who must approach women we are interested in, but are at risk of committing \textbf{sexual} harassment. We have to watch every single word we say even if we are only speaking to our friends for the fear of what someone may hear.We are no longer allowed to use Satire to make light of a serious matter for fear of being labeled as sexist.We are under constant scrutiny and pressure by women in today's society, yet we are the bad guys.Women file 80 of all Divorces.More than 50 of married women cheat at some point in the marriage.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Bryan B There's some inaccurate information in there. I'll address some of it."I believe Feminism and Female Independence is the the 1 cause of male Suicide. "Inaccurate.  Male suicide is more accurately attributed to the following causes: 1. Loss of identity.  This can be a result of grueling divorce, being fired from a job, or being raised in a society where all of your natural inclinations are vilified.  Loss of identity is generally something that happens suddenly, and men do not have the same tools readily available to them, the same support systems that are dedicated to their issues, as women do.  There are almost no men's centers in the US, and there still are none in Canada, for example.2. Loss of access to family. Again, usually from divorce. This can be a result of the court system deciding, due to decades of feminist propaganda, that the mother is the parent and the father is the ATM. The mother uses the child as leverage against the father, and the father, losing sense of self (see 1), reaches a point where he does not see any good option, any way to fix the problem.Men have limited options for removing the financial burden of having a child. Legal Paternal Surrender is a thing, but it comes with such heavy social stigma and violates every tenet that we teach to young boys about duty and responsibility.A man is financially obligated to the mother of his child until the child is 18, even if the burden of that financial obligation impoverishes the man. There are cases where men lost the house and the kids to the wife, could not afford to live on his own, and either became homeless or was forced to live with friends or family.  There are also cases where a man, in the throes of paying child support, has been layed off from his job and, because he still owes child support but has no financial means to pay it, becomes a permanent resident of the prison system.These cases are extreme, but they have happened within the last 10 years and they continue to happen, despite conditions in family court becoming less pro-\textbf{woman} anti-male."Men are being used in necessary jobs that women don't want to do, thus get paid more. Feminists complain about pay gaps when men die in 90+ of work place fatalities, pay child support, and alimony."Slightly inaccurate. Men are more willing to perform physical labor in extreme conditions. Men are more willing to work undesirable shifts or drive longer distances.  Men are more willing to deal with discomfort and inconvenience to provide for their family. This is why men earn more--because they are willing to work and sacrifice for it.Men are 96 of work place deaths, and around 92 of military deaths.  As a \textbf{woman} in a combat zone, you are 62 times less likely to die, even in an active combat zone, than a man."Feminists are telling men that its ok to be emotional, but when we express our feelings about feminism we are called misogynists.Feminists say that it is perfectly acceptable for the man to stay home and take care of the children, but in the majority of custody cases women are chosen for primary custody. "Also slightly inaccurate.  Feminists say they want a man who is sensitive and sweet, and they raise their sons to be walking feminist mouthpieces, but these same women refuse to acknowledge how strongly they are attracted to these stereotypically masculine traits.  There is a reason the best-selling book right now is a submissive fantasy novel. Women crave the behavior they have been training out of their men."Feminism is calling all men Rapists and Misogynists."And rape apologists, scum, monster, creepy, rapey...they say a lot of mean, angry, hateful things."We are told to treat women like equals, but are expected to pay for dates."They like that double standard because it benefits them."We are told women are equals, but you are not allowed to defend yourself from a \textbf{woman} for fear of committing domestic abuse."Women are always the victim. Even though women are four to five times more likely to use a weapon and instigate physical violence, even so far as to premeditate it when the man is asleep or defenseless."We are expected to make the first "move", but must ask for consent for fear of being a rapist."God damn consent porn. I hate "Consent is Sexy". Feminists don't really want consent. They want to be swept off their feet ala 50 Shades. They just want it to be by a good-looking, wealthy man with power and privilege, not you or me."Women file 80 of all Divorces."The last statistic I heard was mid-70s, but your point is still valid.

How have I never seen it before? It perfectly explains why absolutely no feminists are married or have functional healthy relationships with other men.

But the problem with "feminism" is that there is no entry requirement aside from personal declaration, and the community doesn't eject anybody--they simply call the undesirables "bad feminists," leading to the inevitable "No True Scotsman" that most critics of feminism call out.Christina Hoff Sommers is a great example.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Elizabeth Hermann "The lack of reproductive choices available to men are many and varied"After the initial act of conception, in a lot of western countries, women have the right to choose to abort a child and the father has absolutely no say, yet, when a child arrives, the man is expected to fund that child whether he likes it or not. I am not saying that this is wrong, it's your body that has to carry the child and men should pay for their children but I'm just pointing out that all the power is in the hands of women. That continues through that child's life. Courts naturally assume that children are better off with their mums when it comes to custody and some women use access to a child as a weapon against the father but feminism ignores these sexist injustices and concentrates on over-hyped fears.As for your rape victims point. Rape is a very serious crime and defendants have every right to defend themselves. Clothing, \textbf{sexual} history and \textbf{alcohol} consumption are all relevant questions as it helps set the scene of an offence that more often than not comes down to the word of one person against another.I am not saying that women are not free to wear whatever clothes they choose or that there is any excuse for rape but at the same time, if I left my keys in my car door then left it unattended, it wouldn't be surprising if someone stole the car and I'd have to accept some of the responsibility for putting myself in a situation where my car was at risk.

Rapists rape men in prison because that's what they have access to and because it's both ingrained in their personality, and because it's a way for them to acquire power over others in prison. The fact that they target men is due to the fact that it's what's available at the moment, and as I've said, rapists don't look for \textbf{sexual} gratification and can put their \textbf{sexual} preferences in the background in order to satisfy their "need" to have power over others, especially those they see as "inferior" or "weak".\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender, Sexual & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/230 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.304 \\  \hline

Okay, let me get this straight: you believe that people somehow can force men to think they're a \textbf{woman}, and cause them to hate and self-mutilate themselves. I'm assuming you're talking about transsexuals.This is bullshit on the same level as "Homosexuals will turn your children \textbf{g\textbf{ay}}!". Some men don't believe that they're a \textbf{woman} because they've been brainwashed into thinking that, they're like that mostly because they're born that way, in the same way you're born as an heterosexual or \textbf{homosexual} or whatever.Yes, some men want to turn their bodies into female ones (and some women want the inverse - a male body). But it's THEIR body, and THEIR choice.Not only that, but "dehumanizing"? Really? Transsexuals aren't demonizing themselves, they're asserting what they are. If anything, is transphobes who dehumanize them, treating them as a sickness that has to be cured.That is what society has been doing, followed by such circumstance where pretending that biological inherencies are some idea like a fad that can be(safely) changed.Now, let's move on to behaviours.Again, I have to ask: what? Now people who don't act according to whatever "rules" you think aren't appropriate for their biological \textbf{gender} are anti-human? What the shit?!Seriously, you seem unable to comprehend that we're advocating for freedom of choice. We aren't forcing you to turn into a \textbf{woman}! We're saying "You can choose to be what you want! You want to be an overly masculine man? Then that's what you want!"(Besides being a \textbf{woman} doesn't automatically makes you evil or inferior, just like having \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} hair doesn't automatically makes you a demon spawn.)Because yet still, these are not statistics but real people who take much more than generalizing beliefs to make into healthy productive human beings.And now I'm completely lost and really have no idea what you're saying. I think that you're trying to imply that non-masculine men aren's "healthy productive human beings" (which would be BULLSHIT), but I can't decode your sentence...Also look how the latter bit is in on your mind so much.What, are you accusing me of wanting to kill all men? Besides the fact that I am a man and that I identify as a man... when the hell did I say that?All I've said is that, no matter how much feminists say that we're fighting for everyone's right to choose what to do in regard to their sexuality, and no matter how much they fight for it, there's always someone who accuses them to be man-haters who want to create a society of sole women where men are emasculated and used as slaves.

Again - it's because sexist beliefs in our society are centered around:(A) Masculinity being considered "superior" to femininity.(B) Masculinity and femininity being restricted to their respective biological \textbf{sex}.And one of the stereotypes of masculinity is that "real, healthy" men always have a \textbf{sex} drive (the whole "boys will be boys" or "men are always eager" bullshit).While this myth justifies men harassing women, it also has the "side" effects of shaming "beta" (read: not-overly-masculine) men and of disbelieving female-on-male rape victims (who either aren't considered victims because "men are always eager", or are accused of being homosexuals because they weren't "always eager").\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Sex, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/122 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.459 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small This comes across as a dishonest way to market feminism to men. Feminism is about equal rights, yes, but with a chief focus on female issues, as its very name implies.Additionally, you can continue pointing to the formal definition of "feminism" all you want, but the reality is that the social perception of a what a word means is determined by the actions of people who wear that label - because that becomes the de-facto definition of the word. Feminist efforts, for the most part, have continued to be heavily female-oriented, despite the fact that we're now in an \textbf{age} where \textbf{sexism} is a problem that afflicts both sexes to a comparable degree. To tout feminism as the answer to inequality suffered by males (male disposability, lack of resources invested towards male welfare, males being easily demonized as criminals/\textbf{sexual} predators, etc), simply because the formal definition of the word "feminism" includes the phrase "\textbf{gender} equality", is dishonest marketing because feminist efforts haven't tackled those issues to any significant degree.Lacigreen is correct about a lot of the problems she brought up in the video, such as \textbf{homophobia} (a problem suffered more heavily by male homosexuals than female homosexuals), being an issue brought on by a social standard of masculinity imposed on men. A lot of the other issues she highlighted, however, aren't so much \textbf{gender} roles dictated by society as they are by female \textbf{sexual} preference. She lays the blame on the \textbf{patriarchy} for men being pressured to be tall, muscular, powerful, protective, providers, etc. This ignores the realities of \textbf{sexual} dimorphism, and fails to see that those are the very traits females are hardwired to find attractive, and therefore going to want in a man. In a lot of the other issues she raised, she also seemed to have the tendency to think that male issues are really only an offshoot of issues affecting females, which is wholly incorrect.In closing, I'll stress that I have absolutely no problem with the concept of feminism.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small She also said about some pressures that men has, which we don't.So these are the so called "pressures" men has to deal with... 1. \textbf{nobody} can choose theirs height 2. being muscular has three approaches 1. Scientific, 2. Casual1, 3. Casual2. Since this channel isn't much about science I'll just skip that and go to casual approaches: Casual1 - the guy loves sports and that's it (I bet that loving sports has something to do with higher testosterone level than women (try to equal that out, feminists)), Casual2 - the guy cares about his looks (like women cares about theirs too). 3. In some cases it's a necessity to push down feelings, for example, you can't show any of your weaknesses in front of your employer. that's a good skill to learn for any \textbf{gender}. 4. Pressure to be into sports is just bullshit, I'm not into any sports and I never felt a pressure about it, ask any men who's not into sports. 5. To have manly hobbies? So she's saying that some hobbies are just for men? Guess who's being sexist now? There's various hobbies, and if she qualifies for example cars as a manly hobby, that means she's just being sexist. Why there's so little women in cars community? now It's a world dominated by men, but we'd love to have more women to take interest in this. 6. Proving ourselves through violence or intimidation - some men do tend to be violent, not everybody though and if anything women are way better at this, maybe not the violence part, but they are better. For example  men could cut your arm, punch into nose, but he'll leave you as a human being, whereas women will take away your house, your kids, your money, and destroy you as a human being... Golden rule: boys fuck things up, girls are fucked up. 7. Proving manhood by having lots of \textbf{sex}. Ok but that would mean women are having just as much \textbf{sex}... Oh wait... what if they are not? :O And trust me, at least at my company, \textbf{nobody} talks about how much laid they got, there is some \textbf{sex} jokes and that's that. 8. Learning to see women as \textbf{sex} objects. Don't pick deuchebags as your boyfriends and they'll never see you that way. And you'll have your meaningful relationship. It's not our fault that you choose muscular alpha deuchebag males. 9. Now this one I really liked: To pursue physically demanding and dangerous jobs. That is one of the most idiotic things anyone said since "If god doesn't exist then who wrote the bible". We pursue those jobs not because we're men and we want to prove our manliness... Trust me honey if we all could, we all would sit cozy in the office while that much cash flows into our accounts. There's no \textbf{gender} restrictions for those kind of jobs if you want do go to that job, well do it! The reason why in those jobs are mostly men is just because women doesn't employ themselves there if anything \textbf{nobody} likes these kind of jobs, that's why there's such a huge demand and if the demand for a job is huge that means wage is also huge. Men take these kind of jobs not to prove manliness, but take them as a last resort or purely for money. And as I said if you want to, you can also go work dangerously, there's no \textbf{gender} restrictions. 10. Now everything that wasn't mentioned was irrelevant, because there are no such pressures, like being a leader, you can work for somebody else, no one will say a word about that because \textbf{nobody} cares. I just tried to concentrate on more flashy so said "pressures". And she took them and turned them into \textbf{sexism} against women. Though I got to admit it is pretty convincing to watch, thank god that watching from my perspective I started laughing while she named all the "pressures", kinda opened my eyes.That is the biggest brainwashing channel on youtube I've ever seen.

Which basically states that our superego is the one who makes us behave in a civilized manner. If we won't, we won't fulfill our id's desires which is \textbf{sex}, so by following superego rules, like dressing nice, body building, dates etc. we fulfill id's desire and that balance is called ego.So when women choose masculine instead of unmasculine it's basically their fault that men feels the need to be masculine.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Sex & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/330 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.606 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Borg Warner 1) About emotional repression in boys: wrong. It IS a fucking problem. [LINK]  [LINK] 2) Here's a random problem that affects men: rigid parental roles in our society, aka "men=breadwinners, women=child-raiser". Men are brought up thinkig that spending time with the kids is a woman's job. So, if they want kids, the wife is the one supposed to stay at home. Here's all the problems with forcing this system as the only "proper" one:- A parent can't pursue a full-time high-pay career AND raise the kids and take care of the house - there simply isn't nough time. So, the mother can't get remunerative career options, and loses a big chunk of financial independency.- If women are forced to choose between having a family and being financially independent, then they'll tend to look for financial status, rather than \textbf{common} interests or personal compatibility. Cue a higher incidence of unhappy marriages and divorces.- Family courts tend to give more custodial rights to the "primary care-giver" - that is, the parent who spends the most time with the kids, meets their needs etc. This is fair, given that being allowed to live with the PCG is beneficial for the kids themselves. Now, with this system, the PCG is almost always the mother. Thus, child custody will be almost always given to the mother.- The same goes with alimony. Alimony, in a sense, is compensation for sacrificing your present and future earnings (all those years spent staying at home could've been used to pursue a career and reach a high-pay position). With this system, alimony is almost always given to the mother.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Common & \cellcolor{green!5}Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}1/275 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.364 \\  \hline

But to think that the North American notion of manhood is so called "natural" is not only ethnocentric, but \textbf{blind} denial, or for some people, a case of ignorance. All you need to do is this: Open an introductory anthropology book and read about the hundreds of different cultures around the world with different notions of masculinity, femininity, etc. Once you convince yourself that your personality and notion of masculinity is a by-product of your upbringing, start questioning the agents behind this conditioning.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small From a spiritual perspective (or Eckhart Tolle perspective lol) the ego tries to suppress the feminine principle at all costs, since the feminine is closer to what Ekhart Tolle calls, " "Beingness" which would mean annihilation of the ego. In a way, our society is a reflection of this; no wonder our world is going to shit, because we are denying the feminine principle of the Earth, too much \textbf{patriarchy}, too much "power", "dominance", as Marion Woodman once suggested. Many men will read this and unfortunately get all heated. This is not an attack on masculinity. After all, men are essentially modified women, biologically speaking. Don't believe me? All life on earth began through asexual reproduction of females organisms. The male \textbf{sex}, essentially a modified female, evolved later.... basically, the female form is the default form or is the precursor of the male form. You know the story Adam and Eve?

It is a study aimed to ascertain whether or not todays society, even though living in the most liberal \textbf{age} in all of human history, has grown more impatient with tolerating opposing views (political,social,cultural) inversely proportional to the rise of so called "human liberation".I will now continue to state varying opinions on said areas and you will answer with a number from 0-10 how much said statement upsets you.We shall now proceed with the evaluation on your part:1. Freedom of speech, by it's definition, cannot be subjugated to any form of censorship, even if it is used to proclaim contoversial ideas such as sexsism, \textbf{racism} and elitism.2. In the competition of ideas the best will always nuture the most and are therefore superior, so long as the previous condition has been fulfilled.3. I can tolerate the decision of the majority of the population of my country, or any other country, even if the successful ideas are directly opposed to my set of values.4. My inability to comprehend a conflict of ideas will inevitably mean I will deter from commenting on it in a disparaging manner.5. If confronted with an idea, that makes me upset at first, I will always examine it further to make the most competent statement I can in order to productively nuture the progress of the argument.6. Arguments are meant to be solved by logic and reason and not won by whoever utilitizes the most effective strategem regardless if it is aimed ad hominem or ad rem.7. This list of questions should not have an additional query to determine the \textbf{age}, \textbf{sex}, \textbf{race} or \textbf{sexual} orientation of the participant in order to be more accurate, since these qualities are unrelated to a person's world view per se.8. It is not sexsist or \textbf{racist} to say one \textbf{race} is inferior to another \textbf{race} in regards of intelligence, physical capability or any other specific factor of a human being so long as independend studies confirm these to be correct.9. Women are, on an average, physically weaker than men and tend to be more emotionally erratic due to \textbf{sexual} dimorphism and genetic factors selected throughout evolution and are therefore not factors determined by socialization through different \textbf{gender} roles.10.

Another fact you have failed to consider as it does not fit your story telling is the fact that the primary cause of this kind of conditioning is because of what the majority of women seek is a strong confident male, with no perceived weakness.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small A major issue for \textbf{sexism} today is that while feminism claims to try and help equality, it really only does it for women.Women aren't bound to their \textbf{gender} roles anymore, they can go out and get a job, a career and pursue anything a man could now.  (This is great!  It has been a step in the right direction.)However..  Men are still bound to their \textbf{gender} roles, men can't be stay at home dads, ballet dancers or any "female" roles in society.  Some can but almost ALWAYS they are ridiculed, rejected and turned down.  THIS is inequality.It really bothers me that feminism claims to be about equality for all, where it is really about equality for women and women only.  Meanwhile men are still stuck where they are, and even in instances losing rights and treated with more inequality now.  And the moment anyone tries to do something about this, it's given the bannar of MRA and sexist, despite trying to bring about equality.I would support feminism, I hate anyone who belittles a \textbf{woman}, despite a \textbf{woman} being capable of anything a man could do.  But I can't support it because it's getting to the point where women are getting more benefits, and meanwhile men get none, and even get some taken away...  I'm afraid, because I'm at a greater risk and I have less security in my life in comparison.  And to top it off, I'm \textbf{g\textbf{ay}}!  But despite that I'm still at a disadvantage, actually I'm at a much lower disadvantage even, I have fewer opportunities and services.  Now really I'm basically scared of interacting with a \textbf{woman} who outright says they're a feminist, because it makes me feel very vulnerable and I feel I have to tiptoe around...  I'm kinda sick of how much feminists shove in my face how much harder they have it apparently, I have never heard of a \textbf{woman} being restricted from things, facing prison time and even the death penalty for being female...  If I ever travel, I have to be careful, because these things can easily happen to me for being who I am.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gay, Gender, Sexism, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General, Sexual Identity - General, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality & \cellcolor{green!5}9/357 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.521 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The things you think men are "pressured" into being are, in many cases, just the things that men like. They are also a lot of the traits that women find attractive in men...go figure. As many men have pointed out, if feminist are going to try to broach a men's issue, because they would have us believe they are fighting for the issues of women AND men, then they need to start with something important to men because this just isnt. This is about molding men to what women want them to be. Its akin to a man saying " I am here to help the feminist movement, and my 1st order of business is giving every \textbf{woman} better access to breast enlargement surgery."There are serious and important issues that men have brought up that are important to them, start there or dont bother. As part of my undergad degree I took a philosophy of feminism  in an effort to understand modern day feminism. It was a disaster of a class. We were told in lectures that feminism was about "equality for all" yet no discussions or papers were permitted on any subject even remotely outside the scope of women's rights. I believe this is a perfect example of what is wrong with feminism today, and why they have moved beyond the scope of being a healthy belief system. The feminist movement is trying too hard to control the dialogue even to the point where they censor it when they can. And unfortunately, what the feminist movement says and what they actually do are often times not aligned at all.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/271 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.369 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Ooh, I'm so close to being on board with you here, Laci, I really am. You're so close. But you go through the entire video talking about how \textbf{sexism} hurts men too, and then you finish it up by demonizing typically masculine traits-power, dominance, and aggression. You also demonize typically masculine problem-solving methods-violence and intimidation. And you have the nerve to say that \textbf{sexism} is about shaming and devaluing the feminine!Sorry to say it, but shaming and devaluing masculine traits isn't the solution either. Power, dominance, and aggression are good things that get used in shitty ways, but there's no denying that they are what get shit done. Sometimes, there are situations in which someone needs to take the power, be dominant and in charge, and be aggressive about it. And sometimes, violence and intimidation are the only solutions (never mind the fact that intimidation can help prevent unnecessary violence-just ask a cop what kind of power their badge has). You may not say it outright in this video, but you certainly heavily imply that "masculine=bad and feminine=good". I don't think you do it on purpose, seeing as you say that we all have masculine and feminine traits, but judging by the content of your video, you'd have everyone embrace femininity and reject masculinity.If that's not what you mean then be extra careful with your rhetoric next time.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Sexism & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/229 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.873 \\  \hline

The alternative personality would be harmful.Men are protectors because women fear stabbing rampaging rapists. Partly feminisms fault for pointing at all men and saying "possible future rapist".Men are providers because women are free spirits who can do whatever they want. Am I supposed to teach my son to tell his s/o to work or kick rocks? Didnt think so.Men are men because testosterone  (your assumption of how men act are based on that chemical)So.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Feminist: Women are disadvantaged, while men are privileged based on their \textbf{gender}.  There is no such thing as female privilege. Even when men are disadvantaged, it is only because they are being contrasted with women.MRA: Feminists exaggerate the disadvantages of being a \textbf{woman} as well as the advantages to being a man. Men have disadvantages that are often overlooked in the face of equality. My thoughts: \textbf{Gender} may vary based on a person's identity, but \textbf{sex} is definitely binary. There are some things that will always separate the sexes, and that is okay. Men are typically larger and stronger. It should be expected that there /are more men in manual labor jobs etc. It should not, however, be used as a prejudice for a man that he /should take up manual labor over a \textbf{woman}. Things like that should be based on relevant traits, like how capable the individual person is.I believe MRAs and feminists would both agree on this. I feel that the MRM as a whole only exists due to the one major flaw in most feminist arguments; there is no female privilege. Now hold your pitchforks for a second. I'm not saying that women have it easier than men in life. The truth of the matter is that every advantage or disadvantage for one \textbf{gender} is an advantage or disadvantage for the other as well. This is the nature of a binary \textbf{sex} system. Here's one example of many that I can give : "I'm a man because I'm NOT emotional, like women." Couldn't you also say "I'm a \textbf{woman} because I'm COMPASSIONATE, unlike men"? These standards are different and related to how we define each \textbf{gender} individually, not relatively. The only reason it seems relative is, again, because \textbf{sex} is binary and there is only one other option and \textbf{gender} roles are based on \textbf{sex}.I really feel that feminism can make a lot of ground by recognizing the standards placed on men (which I applaud Laci for doing), but also recognizing how a lot of those end up being beneficial for women. These issues, unlike \textbf{sex}, are not binary. An example of what I mean here is this: "prove your manhood by having lots of \textbf{sex}." This is a standard held on men, but there are also three other standards that this ties into. Men that don't have \textbf{sex} are losers, women that have a lot of \textbf{sex} are thought of as "easy," and women that choose to wait for meaningful \textbf{sexual} encounters are praised for their dignity. These can be fair or unfair standards for either \textbf{gender} and should be seen as such. Instead of telling women they're sluts for sleeping around and telling men they're losers for not getting laid, why not just tell people to do what feels right and have \textbf{sex} when you feel comfortable with it? Stop focusing on telling men not to rape and women not to "ask for it" with their clothing choices, and focus on telling people that forcing \textbf{sexual} contact on other people is just not cool. Laci does a good job talking about these things in her videos. I agree with her on the core of these issues, but find her approach to be very one-sided at times. There's really \textbf{nothing} wrong with men or women wanting to be macho or pretty and I feel that the heavy focus on breaking \textbf{gender} roles has the opposite effect of making people feel persecuted if they fit into them. tl;dr - Don't point fingers at sexes for being right, wrong, oppressive, or , but continue promoting being a free and good person to everyone regardless of their \textbf{gender}.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender, Nothing, Sex, Sexual, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}23/613 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.752 \\  \hline

They were once expected to always be at home with the kids, nurturing and do all the housework, but, now they have become free of that role if they want, they can go and work in whatever job they want, they have equal pay for the same hours and role and are no longer restrained to their role.Men on the other hand are still being forced to their '\textbf{gender} role'. We are seen always as protector, breadwinner, the strong one and whenever we try and be the opposite women call us weak or not a real man?

And the vast majority of them thought that this was the right thing to do (about 80 - 90 of them). Just ONE women told me that she thought it was unfair, that the guy had to pay for the first date, just because he is looking for a relationship. Why shouldn´t a man have the same opportunity to meet women, in order to find a girlfriend and pay a lot of money for it, when women don´t have to do it?And most men know all this. They know that most women expect them to pay the bills on a forst date. Or that some women expect to get flowers or a bottle of wine.And I discussed that topic on a discussion board with plenty of women. And some of them got very upset and angry by the thought that they should pay their share on a first date. (Just their share! I was not talking about the \textbf{woman} paying the bill for the man!).Their justification was that they are not interested in a man who is not a "gentleman" or who is "cheap".

Granted, he is lucky to have a girlfriend like you who doesn´t expect him to pay all the time. (But I also don´t know the background and how much else he is paying for in your relationship.)

As for the harmful to women, see some of the discussions had by the honey badgers and girlwriteswhat.I think the main reason you don't bother debating the subject is similar for a lot of people in your position. You cannot debate it because you are inherently wrong. Provably so. So instead of getting your hands dirty and defending your argument, you dismiss it as just misogynistic. Laci is a liar, she misrepresents the data she uses and routinely talks out of her ass. that is why she gets the hate.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Julius Cheeser So, let's run this through.1) First of all, feminism is for \textbf{gender} equality. I think you're mistaking feminists (\textbf{gender} equality) with the second-generation radfems (female superiority). The fact that you claim that Laci is a radfem is proof enough of that - especially given that you haven't brought a single point against what she has said.2) The fact that your hostility against women "wins" you some favor from anti-feminist is irrilevant. If you disagree, then look at the amount of likes and subscriptions Laci gets - she gets a lot of favor, too.3) Third, both of those are stereotypes you brought no proof on. Being \textbf{fat} is irrilevant for being a feminist as much as having freckles. Not to mention that Laci has never expressed hatred for "good-looking" women, in any of her videos.4) Another stereotype: women crying rape for \textbf{nothing}. Not true. First of all: less than 40 of all rape cases are ever reported to the police.www.rainn.org/statisticsSecond, false rape accusations make up only 2-6 of all reported rapes, and between 2 and 0,7 of all rape cases period. For comparison: false auto theft reports are 10 of all reported auto thefts, and at least 2,6 of all auto thefts period.It's also extremely rare for a false rape accusation to result in an unjust sentence (yes, this also includes the cases where the accused pleads). The biggest amount of unjust sentences caused by false rape accusations were a dozen in ten years. During those ten years, there have been more than a million reported rapes, and almost 3 millions rape and \textbf{sexual} assault cases period. [LINK]  [LINK] 5) Neither you nor your friends know Laci Green. Your previous four points were all blatantly false and devoid of actual evidence.

Values that never seem to be assigned to women. Have you ever considered that maybe Certain "male" values should be applied to EVERYONE? Instead of destroying all male values, maybe we should all adapt a few? I mean, some of these ideals must be of some value. The ability to complain and argue is a necessity for the human \textbf{race} to evolve, but feminism is turning America into a bunch of fucking babies, who complain about stupid shit. You say that society says men can't talk about our feelings, but they should be allowed to, right? Then how come every time I try to talk about my feelings about feminism to feminists, I get told to 'Shut the fuck up. You're a man. You couldn't possible understand the oppression we face here.' Well guess what, Fuck you feminism. Fuck you. I can't understand oppression because I'm a man? That's sexist.Well maybe you're right. Maybe I can't understand oppression. Wrong. My family comes from a long line of Jews. I knew and talked to my great grandparents in person. I know how close they were to being killed in pogroms, and I know how minorities are oppressed throughout history. By the way, being female in the USA, doesn't make you a minority.I was bullied for being Jewish. Big fucking deal. Who gives a shit? I learned to take a verbal punch and it taught me that the world is full of ignorant people, and even then I knew that there were and are people who have, and are having a rougher time than I ever will.What you are experiencing is not oppression. In many countries in the world, there is real oppression against all kinds of people (Including women!) who don't deserve the shit they have to go through, SO STOP COMPLAINING ABOUT YOUR 'OPPRESSION'. If you really want to do some good for women, go to countries that practice real oppression and make a REAL difference.Lmfao, pathetic 'victims'\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Race, Sex, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/398 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.754 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Although I respect what you have stated I do not think it is society forcing us to be powerful and dominant. We just want to be different from women. If we just had a bunch of sissies running around \textbf{nothing} would get done. A mans main role is to provide for the family and protect our family so we need to be big and strong.This is where I don't like trans men. Fake men don't have the same kind of mind as normal men. So they don't have the same drive as men. It might be more difficult for \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} and trans men to be manly.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small It's an interesting mixture in there.I do wonder why you have strength, knowledge and emotional stability listed alongside \textbf{homophobia}, transphobia, and aggression. The last three (\textbf{homophobia}, transphobia, and aggression) we can all do without, and the first three (strength, knowledge and emotional stability) all genders can do with having more of.One thing I've noticed is that while society as a whole has decided \textbf{sex} discrimination is a bad thing, there's claims floating around that we "live in a \textbf{patriarchy}" or we "live in a rape culture."I think the specific problem we have is our education systems are not fit for purpose. There is a combination of parental influence that imposes different roles on boys and girls in their first few years of life, and then peer group inflience when they go to school seems to be it's own society that older kids pass on to younger kids in between classes. Teachers don't have that much influence on the students, they're just this background noise that is largely ignored (see educational attainment statistics for details). Fewer students per teacher (which would mean hiring about 4 to 10 times the current ammount of teachers depending on local staffing levels) and a teaching doctorine that calls on teachers to test their students knowledge more frequently could help wipe out these last pockets of stupid keeping \textbf{sexism}, \textbf{homophobia} and transphobia alive.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Homophobia, Patriarchy, Sex, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General, Sexual Identity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}6/230 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.609 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I have a question about the first part of the video when Laci was talking about the male stereotypes. Wouldn't things men are taught because of there \textbf{gender} be considered different then the opposite \textbf{sex}. What I mean Is she said these things are taught to stray from resembling a \textbf{woman} e.g. "men don't show emotion unlike \textbf{woman}". Isn't that the same as saying "Men wear a cup unlike women". Anything that is taught to someone because of there \textbf{gender} is taught because it doesn't apply to the other. The examples above are like saying "Women clean up after themselves unlike men" or " women use tampons unlike men". I don't agree with any form of \textbf{gender} stereotypes, but the point made by Laci seemed like a double standard to me. Also men are physically larger than \textbf{woman}. So I do believe if you are weaker than a \textbf{woman} of similar size that shows signs you don't care for your body. Kind of like if you buy a car new and someone else buys the same car used, but your car stops working after 10 years, but there's lives on for 20. The new car is expected to last longer,  so it makes sense people would be surprised to see it dead on the side of the road. Sorry if I offended anyone, I was just voicing my opinion. If your going to reply please be respectful as I will show you the same courtesy. I do invite a counter argument in case I made a mistake, since I like to better myself.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender, Sex, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}8/263 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.042 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I think that there is a difference between things like wearing a cup and tampons and being taught that you're not allowed to cry or feel emotions because that makes you not masculine. People with penises wear cups during sports to protect themselves from getting hit there. People who menstruate use tampons and pads so they don't bleed on things. But there's not a real reason that men shouldn't cry and women should, or that men should be aggressive and women shouldn't. These stereotypes about masculinity and femininity are harmful and create expectations for both genders that are harmful. Taking care of your body (using a cup, using pads) is a practical thing. Addressing the point of not taking care of yourself and men being physically stronger than women. Yes, men's bodies are biologically stronger than women's. However, I think it's interesting that a man would be defined as being lazy or not taking care of himself if he isn't as strong as a \textbf{woman} his size. Maybe that \textbf{woman} goes to the gym  a lot. Maybe she's just naturally muscular, and he's not. Maybe he's comfortable with the body that he has, and just doesn't feel like working out. I think that when you say that they're not taking care of themselves, you're playing into stereotypes about male power and strength and that men should be strong and women weak. I personally don't think that it should matter, and that men shouldn't have to feel like they need to be stronger than women, and that women shouldn't feel like they can't work out or be strong because it will somehow emasculate men. Thanks!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/274 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.73 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Ftchabam I never said stereotypes based on \textbf{gender} were a good thing. I stated that Laci didn't address both genders, when she claimed \textbf{gender} stereotypes applied to men, were made to limit there resemblance to women. I was trying to say it could go both ways. Disregarding the two examples I gave based on the anatomy of men and women, the other examples still stand. In this society a principle often taught to young boys are, to not show emotion. One might argue that this is to limit the resemblance between male and females. A principle in this society often taught to young girls is to be clean and tightly. One might argue that this is to differ themselves from male characteristics. I'm not saying either of these should be in place, as they serve no purpose in society. I am saying however, Laci made it seem men use these \textbf{gender} based stereotypes to put down women, even though it could easily go both ways. I took personal offense when she was saying things like "Men are strong unlike women" "Men are good at sports unlike women". When she said these things it makes it seem all men think this way, which I assure all people reading this, not all men think that way. Maybe its because I interpreted it as Laci insulting the way she believes all men think while victimizing them.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/233 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.288 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small So at 1:07, you're saying (word for word) that \textbf{sexism} is "about shaming, belittling and devaluing the feminine". Seriously? Even when you are claiming to be talking about how \textbf{sexism} affects men, you only talk about the issues from a feminist perspective. If there is any progress to be made, people on both sides have to at least try to understand the under side.For example, when you talk about how men are affected by \textbf{sexism} (0:18 to 0:56), you are specifically targeting stereotypes that are directly tied to your own agenda. "To be one of the boys", "sexualize women and not be able to have meaningful relationships", etc, these are all deliberately singled out to fit your portrayal of the stereotypical man of being a "\textbf{sex} crazed raping machine", which ironically, is sexist on your part.Why not include some of the other ways men are discriminated against based on their \textbf{sex}? For once, talk about how there are women who fake getting raped to get back at a man. That is not only hurting men, but hurting real rape victims as well. Talk about issues that equally affect both sides. By only pushing your agenda you are only pushing the other side away, you are accusing men of being the embodiment of all the negative things in the world, and that men are the only things that need to change, to fit your idea of an equal society. That is not equality, by any means.For people watching these videos, I implore you to seek out your own information. Do your own homework, and make your own decisions. Laci, like any vlogger has her own beliefs and is providing information that successfully push her own agenda. Not saying it's wrong, but I just felt it needed to be said that she is talking about these things like they are \textbf{black} and white when in fact there are a million shades of grey in between that should be discussed as well.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Sex, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}6/332 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.807 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small This is stupid saying that the \textbf{gender} norms for men are a reason why feminism exists. Using this logic you could say women are kind, unlike men women care about there appearance unlike men etc. You see my point in this video you made the point that the male stereotypes are avoiding to be like women but men get the same treatment. hypothetically let's state that i told a man and a women that they look like someone of the opposite \textbf{gender} i bet you all my money i ever earn that a female would establish more anger and offence to the statement then the men, so according to this point surely women are more sexist to men than the other way round but there not and same the other way round. I support feminism to massive degrees i think that women do get some exclusive problems that make there life's worse than men's but this argument is just a bias argument \textbf{witch} attempts to establish a poor point.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender, Witch & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - Female age and physical appearance, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/169 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.775 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small See, this is the feminism I've appreciated, but I feel like some feminist, man-hating extremists have besmirched the name. I personally have never cared for the name feminism because of the harassment and abuse I've suffered at the hands of women in my life, and I also have held the belief that a word that means equality, as people say feminism does, should not have a gendered prefix such as fem. Otherwise, Laci, I'm really happy you made this video. As a \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} man who has suffered at the hands of men and women throughout my life, I really appreciate that someone with as strong and known of a voice as yours has made these points known, and so eloquently. However, I wouldn't necessarily say that all of men's problems have to do with being perceived as feminine. For instance, some problems show themselves in rape statistics; the amount of women who get away with statutory rape, the amount of men who are falsely accused, and the false male victim statistics released by the CDC. The statistics of male rape victims are grossly under-represented. The CDC defines forcing a male to arousal and to insert himself as "forced insertion" and \textbf{sexual} assault, not rape, and therefore reduces the amount they have to list as rape victims. If corrected, male rape victim counts would rise to about one in seven with assault victims rising to about one in four. That means giving a man a blowjob if doesn't want it isn't defined as rape by the CDC even though it is, as logic and \textbf{common} sense would define it, rape. Just one of the many issues that I think needs a little more consideration before we claim that mens' problems are still the result of wishing to be perceived as masculine.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Common, Gay, Sexual & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General, Sexual Identity - General, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}4/300 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.333 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Just a not-so-quick note to all those in the comment section ranting about "\textbf{misandry}", and "anti-feminism". First of all, news flash, \textbf{misandry} is not a thing! That's right. It doesn't exist. The male \textbf{gender} is not systematically oppressed and pushed down by a sexist society. Actually, to every full dollar the average man earns, the average \textbf{woman} only earns 75 cents! Yes, men are negatively affected by \textbf{sexism} and the binary culture in which we currently live does push them to meet impossible and inhuman standards--often even forcing them into an unhealthy mentality and making them abusive--however, men are not oppressed for the fact that they are men. In fact, a man is twice as likely to have a high-standing job, than any \textbf{woman} is. He is more likely to get hired, and more likely to get paid more. Of course, this is excluding men of color, \textbf{q\textbf{ueer}} men, and trans men--who are much less likely to strive, and are just as oppressed and looked down upon as the next marginalized group. "But we pay for dates!" You say, "It's not fair--we need to do all the work!" That's because a sexist society has pushed you to believe that because you're a man, you need to be strong and you need to do all the work, otherwise you're not a man. And according to these values, if you're not a real man, you're useless garbage. Yet another reason we need to work to eliminate--or at least subdue--\textbf{sexism} in society. Secondly, saying "anti-feminism pro equality" is pretty pointless and contradictory. Feminism is literally the concept of social, economic, and total equality between men and women, and every \textbf{gender} on the spectrum. It fights for the benefit of everyone, and not just women. Yes, it is mostly dominated by women and has been for a long time, but I have a feeling that's mainly because the good majority of men seem to find feminism shameful and try to distance themselves as much as they can. If more men would embrace feminism and continuously spread the correct definition of the feminist movement, it's likely that the benefits of feminism will be more clear. Feminism is not a hate movement. It's not about female supremacy. It's about equality, and making the world a better place for everyone.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Nope. Disagree with so much of this. Majority of your points are based on male instincts. We live in a social society and being Muscular and dominant are important. Sports and various other aspects are massively important. These aspects are about survival and most of all being HEALTHY. I'll admit, I'm \textbf{skinny}. But my god I hit the gym every night because I want a good body. A strong body for my future career in the Military as a Pilot after I finish University, a strong muscular body to attract a nice beautiful partner (Or for my instinct, a mate.) A strong muscular body so I can defend myself against attacks that I may ever face or so I can defend my family as of now and my future family when I have children. You're trying to fit the view of the minority. The minority of those who excuse themselves because they have been victimized and bullied and now they blame the majority because they felt the need to enjoy sports, build muscle, be dominant and to have lots of \textbf{sex}. I am a male, I am an animal. I have desire to be big and strong. I have desire to have plenty of \textbf{sex} throughout my life. I enjoy sport as it means I can have fun, be healthy and enjoy winning over another team and getting a good healthy dose of Dopamine.Winners are dominant. Be it in the animal kingdom or the world of business. I have to be mean and unforgiving to make it to the top. If I hold every ones hand as I try to make it up telling them it's okay to \textbf{fat} or \textbf{skinny}, it's okay to not want to be pushed around; it's okay that you see \textbf{sex} as something you shouldn't do often; it's okay you want to fulfill a woman's \textbf{gender} role. I don't care, I will be the majority and push to be the strongest, the best and the leader. I am a man, that is my job. My hormones, mind and instincts are to do such a thing. Opinions can't change my \textbf{sex}. And you can sit there and complain about \textbf{gender} roles and how they shouldn't exist, but my fucking god they have too. It's society, it's how biology works. You have a womb and large hips, I have broad shoulders and muscles. My body does that for me to be dominant and strong, to be the protector of my mate and young. Society wouldn't function if we all filled the same role, saturation for the male dominant and female dominant jobs would be ridiculous. There wouldn't be a mindset of what jobs are "good" for your \textbf{sex} implanted from a young \textbf{age}. You can even see the majority of children already fit their \textbf{gender} role with no influence what so ever. Young boys want the dangerous jobs, like a spaceman, firefighter, policeman or army man. And little girls want to be caring such as veterinarians, nurses and \textbf{doctors}, teachers and other care specific jobs. You can't run away from biology, as much as feminists say that men have roles that they don't want to fulfill because society depicts them, they are wrong. I don't even know why I'm writing this? We should be more concerned about the religions that belittle young women and men who beat their wives because it is their right.. Feminists are quite selfish as are Mens right activists. This is the wrong part of the world to be discussing this... Minimum wage is set equally. Women have equal pay. They get an education and can vote yet there are parts of the world where they cannot and still they fight because society (THE FEMINIST BECAUSE IT IS A COLLECTIVE) has got it wrong... Please.. Biology determines who we are and what we will be. If I'm gunna be a sensitive guy who thinks society has a bad depiction of men then I have no fucking chance in the world. Men don't need shit. Women don't need shit. We're equal.

So i help her out, I knew her for a while just only at school. So i told her "hey we should hang out sometime either my place OR (key word is "OR", ill explain in a bit) anywhere." she said she was busy and i just continued on in my day, then her boyfriend comes to me saying that he didnt appreciate what i tried to do and im like Da fuck? so i asked her about it and she told me that me helping her was being to forward and i shouldnt have done that and that me asking to hang out at my place (remember I said my place or ANYWHERE else, but apparently she only heard "my place".) she felt that i had other intentions.Seriously? i did what I thought (as a gentlemen) was the right thing to do is now apparently its a \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} flag for rape (the way how she worded it, she was implying i was some \textbf{sexual} predator because i help carry her things and asked to hang out as just friends.) And ive read an article explaining that guys are just opting out of engaging women because the shit theyre being taught at a young \textbf{age} that every guy is out to get them, if they offer to hang out they prolly wanna rape you etc. and young guys like me just dont want to deal with that or WORSE get fired or thrown in prison over a stupid ass assumption. It seems like feminism is really demonizing ALL men. And i feel really shitty because my mom taught me to respect women and all my life women have done \textbf{nothing} but disrespect me. why should i be treated like shit? because some other guy wronged you?but if i disrespect a girl im a "typical guy just like the rest and all the good ones are dead." when in reality the good men are treated like second class citizens but are somehow still wanted buy the same ppl that killed them off. I dont understand dateing anymore and quite frankly im tired of all this bullshit. Im all for equality but it seems like this whole feminist movement is leading towards supremacy, \textbf{sexism}, and oppression. I dont mind if the assholes got treated this way but they dont and all the good men are seen as potential threats and are left on the stake to burn. and no matter what a guy does hes in the wrong. women can judge a man by his looks, body type, wealth (wealth i can kinda agree on), they can call a guy ugly, hit him in public, rob him, kill him and it would all somehow be his fault and no one bats an eye. but if a man EVER judged a girl on the same exact things. Holy mother of christ what a fucking typical shallow pig that only wants them for theyre looks, money, etc.Theyre is no equality and i feel like its going backwards from it. im 21 and already the girls in my \textbf{age} group and below are already being brainwashed into thinking in such a  harsh way. I have no problem with being careful, but labeling a guy as a \textbf{sexual} predator in a college environment that you have the potential to get hired from a company, is really dangerous and girls talk, oh yes they do. and im sure shes been telling everyone what a creep i was for helping her out and wanting to get to know her better and further giving other girls a predetermined judgement on me before they even meet me. This needs to stop and i think the only women that ACTUALLY have a normal brain are much older than me but i have a 2 year cap so yea.and the whole competing to be a man is utter bullshit, you can make a animal planet documentary around how fucking stupid we are in trying to be the alpha's and trying to mate or get anywhere in life. just because you have good looks, a muscular body, shitty attitude, bad manners doesnt make you an alpha, having feelings doesnt make you a beta. Ive been challenged and called out by so called "alphas" and well lets just say theyre not going around talking shit anymore. bottom line is we need to teach our kids actual equality, boys need to be taught thats its ok to cry and you dont need a perfect body to impress girls. and girls need to be taught that yes theyre are guys out there that have bad intentions but you shouldnt assume every man is a bad man. because when it comes down to it every good guy or girl goes bad when you mistreat them. and so far good guys and girls are non existent to me.- sincerely the guy who quit on societythe article i mentioned:  [LINK] \normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Nothing, Red, Sexism, Sexual & \cellcolor{green!27} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Age - General, Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Native-American, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}8/864 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.926 \\  \hline

I hope people get a chance to read it despite it not being the latest upload.It makes me sick to see that so many posts from men (haven't seen many women do this), on Lacie's videos, are shaming, hateful, misogynistic, ABUSIVE, and down right trolling. Firstly, why you here? Do you enjoy being angry? Do you enjoy intimidating people with your words? Do you enjoy looking like an idiot? Are you looking to shock? It works but for all the wrong reasons. You only make yourself look like an abusive sexist bigot with a closed off mind. Second, to those who do it, I feel incredibly sorry for you. Posters like Doxastic (from another video) are shit-bags. Whether or not they cat call on the street or troll on a forum, what they do is WRONG. It's as simple as that. Where is your concern for other people? Where is your freakin' compassion? Further, like Lacie says in another video, if you're a male and you see people acting like jerks towards ANYBODY, speak up. It's not because you're their protecter but more so that some men are so daft and being called out by "one of their own kind" is the only way to respect an opinion.Women are treated like absolute shit in this society and it's up to EVERYBODY to be a fair and good person. Things might seem "better than they were" but the underlying \textbf{misogyny} is still absolutely there. Whether it's obvious or not is beside the point. I'm sorry you have to deal with this crap, Lacie.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small thank you so much, laci! not only for this video, but also for all the other terribly important work you do.in some ways this video is even more awesome than your others to me. it makes me happy because thoughts and knowledge in my head were a bit more connected. thats a great feeling. to feel that you understand the world an eetsy-bit more. all of your thoughts are familiar to me. i am, like probably evry open and active feminist is, often confronted with the discussion about the term 'feminism' and how the 'fem' in the term is excluding and about the idea of calling it 'equalism'. so as i watched this video my thoughts and opinion about this question got clearer. as you say, loads of problems for men as a result of \textbf{sexism} are product of a male world opposing to the female/feminine. so if we continue to fight for a world in which being feminine is not an insult, but just another possible way to be for whoever you are, we obviously fight for the well-being of e-v-e-r-y-b-o-d-y. and the importance of fighting for femininity as being somehing extremely positive if you feel able to decide freely for yourself that that's (sometimes and a part of) how you want to be is why i am still (or now more then ever) a big fan of the FEMinism!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Sexism & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/232 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.431 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Gender roles? I like how the assumption that "\textbf{gender} roles" are a creation of some \textbf{patriarchy}, and not a natural evolution of humanity. Nature is obviously a \textbf{misogynist} because it created \textbf{gender} roles through evolution. Women bear children and have mammary glands to feed them, men grow larger in size and are physically stronger to protect their "brood". The purpose of feminism is to deny evolution and hundreds of thousands of years of human existence. I wouldn't say feminism hurts men because it hurts all of society by denying that which nature created. There was not an evil cabal of males standing around 300,000 years ago saying "We need to keep these women at home nursing children, let's invent boobs!". Every species in the animal kingdom has "\textbf{gender} roles", it's just the feminists wish that the human female's \textbf{gender} role was similar to that of the preying mantis. \textbf{Gender} roles are not something you can eliminate with social justice speeches and laws, it would take a full on deflection of human evolution.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender, Misogynist, Patriarchy & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}8/172 & \cellcolor{green!27}4.651 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Power, dominance and aggression are instinctual in boys, you can´t get it out of them. It´s evolution.The human species evolved with women living in the environment of their babies, and men lived in the environment of wolves. Furthermore the sole purpose of the disposition developed in men was the protection of women and their offspring.Men were then as now expected to die in the protection of women and to give their lives in the hunt for meat, the death of ten males was a setback, sure, but a reversible one, whilst the death of ten women would be a catastrophe.This is for a simple reason: ten dead men=ten dead men, ten dead women= 50-100+ unborn babies, and that only in the first generation! Men and women are different by biology in ways that cannot be reversed or changed and are attracted to different things and have different dispositions generally, we should be accepting of this and adapt society to support humanity and not the other way around. When a man is being aggressive and when a \textbf{woman} is crying, I don´t think anyone has the right to force either one of them to stop.

I lost my virginity to some one I'll never forget, but it wasn't until this year that I stopped being called "Virgin!". There is a certain type of person I'll let listen to my music, not closed minded D-bags, because once a friend of mine who happened to me a girl called my music girly, I was taken aback and did not know how to respond to that. I don't wanna be the leader because society told me to. I want to be a beacon that everyone aspires to like Sephiroth (before he went batshit \textbf{crazy}), or Commander Shepard (Male or Female). Also, I don't use violence and intimidation to solve my problems, I'm told I'm quite cordial and nice by others, but I won't toot my own horn. But, when you have the rare D-Bag who comes into my life for moments and crosses a line, I just decide that this person needs to hurt.(Like somebody who comes into your house, you tell them to leave and they try this alpha male bullshit and telling you they will leave when they feel.) Not so much lately, but it has happened, and I doubt it won't happen again. Problem with \textbf{sexism} and men isn't as powerful as \textbf{sexism} and women, but men have a nicer time of it. However, just because they have a nicer time doesn't mean they should be ignored and hated, because not every man wants to go by this bullcrap society feeds, and some men grow up in a household of women(Me).\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Crazy, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}4/267 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.498 \\  \hline

The bigger issue is that she claims feminism is about handling \textbf{sexism} against men - that's simply not true at all. Feminism is solely about making women equal to men. There's \textbf{nothing} wrong with this - if you want to focus solely on women's issues, fine. Or, if you want to be a feminist and an egalitarian (though this is arguably redundant), go right ahead! I don't consider myself a feminist because most feminists victimize women when they aren't victims and demonize men when they aren't guilty. I'm all for equality between men and women and if this makes me a feminist, fine - but I still won't call myself a feminist because I don't want people to think what I support is what most other big name feminists support.Laci has bought into a lot of feminist bullshit such as the "ban bossy" campaign. She even quoted a source in which a feminist measured how people physically view men and women (eyeball movement), so that they could conclude how people value women. You can't judge how a person is valued by measuring their eyeball movement - what this feminist did was use one word with two meanings to support her own biased agenda. She argued that people view women as a collection of parts, which must mean people "view" women as mere objects - even though the 2nd "view" has a totally different meaning and doesn't correlate with the initial premise.This is why Laci gets crap, because she overlooks these things. She also gets crap for other ridiculous views such s the notion that drunk women can't consent to \textbf{sex}, therefore it's automatically rape.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nothing, Sex, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/306 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.98 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I found her list of instances where \textbf{sexism} huts men bit incomplete and with some errors.1. Men are seen disposable while \textbf{woman} are seen as valuable. dangerous jobs is one of examples she mentioned, but she somehow tried to frame this as a privilege. Framing your disposability as privilege is not a new thing. After all, what same person would put his life on a line without at least some kind of reward, at least imaginary. Another thing is violence against women vs violence against men. If women gets beaten our society goes insane, if men are beaten, meh....2. Men are valued for their utility, women has intrinsic value. For instance, women are looking for man, that is at same of higher social status than she is, while for man, women's social status doesn't matter as long as she pretty. For instance, I can bet, the fact, that Laci graduated from college, I believe, strongly suggests that she didn't have janitor boyfriend lately. Am I right? Further more in our society if \textbf{woman} is not ready to be a mum society helps her not to. If a man on the other hand is not ready to be a dad, society extorts him.3. Men are seen as de facto villains, and women are seen as de facto victims. In order to prove in any given situation is often called victim blaming. If a man hits a \textbf{woman}, we think that he is a monster, if a women hits a man we believe, that it's because he is a monster.4. Women and girls are seen as golden standard of behavior, while men and boys are seen as damaged girls. You don't talk about your emotions like a \textbf{woman}, your emotional intelligence are underdeveloped. You are forced to read girlish books in classes and if you treat like a boy you are misbehaving. If you are attempting to solve the problem rather than talk about it, you are damaged by testosterone right?5. Men, who goes to speak out about their problems without apologizing that they are men, and talking about problems caused by feminism, rather than \textbf{patriarchy} you are dismissed out of hand as \textbf{misogynist}, no matter what you have to say, or how valid your points are.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Misogynist, Patriarchy, Sexism, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}7/380 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.842 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small So, men are pushed to be manly because women are less then men then women are pushed to be feminine because men are less then women, right? This extremely silly idea that \textbf{sexism} is all about women even when talking about how \textbf{sexism} effects men just makes feminism seem retarded. Of course, I think men face more pressure to be manly then women do to be feminine and that has a lot to do with feminism. If we look back to the 1900s, male and female roles where extremely segregated. It was very inappropriate to men to act at all like women and for women to act at all like men. The first big brake down of this was women getting the right to vote. Then was the WW2 and rosie the riveter. The US government needed women to do "male jobs" to make what was needed to win the war. Then feminist pushed to make it more and more culturally acceptable for women to act more like traditional men until today where there is very little that women can to that is thought as unacceptable for women to do. But the fact is, feminist always ignored men's issues so men's issues did not change. While I think there was some natural change between 1900 and today, there was not active force working to change the culturally acceptable ways men could be and act. But the problem is not that feminism, which changed the way we see women's roles but did almost \textbf{nothing} to changed the way we see men's roles then feminist blame \textbf{sexism} men face on men looking down on women?

For instance, if you're a guy that is a bit more feminine, then go ahead and be feminine! Don't let people tell you otherwise. I'm sure by now, everyone has realized that Laci is making generalizations about men and their problems. Some men have to deal with those things and others don't.

People who bestow stereotypes among different genders are wrong, for everyone is different and people judging a whole \textbf{gender} based upon the actions of a few are absolutely biased.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I agree with a lot of what she's saying in this video, but you have to remember that \textbf{gender} norms are reinforced by women as well. Less open-minded women only want to pursue relationships with the typical strong/protector/masculine/whatever man - the "alpha male". That's why men feel pressure to act like tough guys, I think, because generally women get turned off by seeing a man express his feelings too much or exhibiting too many feminine characteristics. It's not all because of validation within their own \textbf{gender}, although I'll concede that that's part of it.Not to mention, a lot of men turn into hypermasculine douches because they have no model on how to interact with women. It doesn't necessarily have to be a dad, I don't have a dad (and I was very narrowly saved from becoming an asshole), but I think all heterosexual men should have a good model for how to interact with women. In the absence of that, they'll be scarred by their failures and become bitter towards women. The entire pickup artist industry thrives on insecure men who have no such role model, and I think we've all seen what that group does to men and women alike.It's frustrating though - extremely so - that there are no resources to go to when one is simply socially inept. Most people learn social skills on the playground, but for those of us who didn't, catching up is a difficult task. \textbf{Nobody} sympathizes with you when you're "awkward", "creepy", or an "autist". \textbf{NOBODY}. People need to make an effort to sympathize with us folks who through no fault of our own grew up without learning the social skills required to have \textbf{sex} or get into a relationship.Just my two cents.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender, Nobody, Sex & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}5/294 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.701 \\  \hline

Unlike men, women are the bottleneck in terms of having children.In other words, the reason that men can't afford to "be women" isn't that women are seen as inferior. It's actually that men are seen as inferior, and therefore society says they are not worthy of being unproductive and draining resources without doing something in return.Yes we are starting to compensate for that, but there is a long long way to go.

She said "The myth among feminists that men will insult each other for displaying feminine traits because they see women as inferior is just that–a myth. Men do this because women have a trump card that bestows intrinsic value on them–their uteruses–and they retain that value even when they gender-bend a little. A \textbf{woman} who acts like a \textbf{woman} is not seen as inferior. A man who acts like a \textbf{woman} has always been seen not as a \textbf{woman}, but as a '\textbf{woman} without a womb'. He has no female value, and he has no male value. Therefore, he has NO value at all. And unlike women, men who were not 'useful' did–and still do–get thrown on the trash heap of society."

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Men have their genitals mutilated at birth without a second thought, permanently reducing their ability to have and enjoy \textbf{sex}.Men can be forced into parenthood through paternity fraud and legal forms of rape, when a man consents to \textbf{sex} for reasons other than parenthood and the \textbf{woman} violates that consent. Force parenthood is illegal when the victim is female but legally sanctioned when the victim is male.These things are wrong. They are \textbf{sex} crimes that need to be recognized, but aren't, effectively making men into a fully objectified slave class in an actual  rapeculture   where most of the victims are male.Men serve prison sentences about twice as long as females do for the same crimes, if females are charged at all. Men are required to register for the draft in order to receive benefits that females receive automatically. Men are denied due process and presumed guilty when accused of \textbf{sex} crimes against women or domestic violence through such enforcement practices as the primary aggressor policy. Men can be sent to debtor's prisons without the right to an attorney through the child support system.These are real issues that drive the suicide rate for men four times higher than it is for women. Four times! The rate is much higher for veterans, who are particularly vulnerable to paternity fraud, a crime that should be considered worse than rape--if people might ever stop to think of it as a crime at all, which they won't do because men are more disposable than women. THAT'S how \textbf{sexism} affects men.

While she speaks of these male issues you'll find her rather disinterested in men's perspective which she presumes to be some flawed perspective in need of correction by women like her.  It's about female chauvinism and not equality.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Why is everyone acting this way! Of course \textbf{sexism} hurts both genders. Both genders should be free to act and feel what they like without societal pressure. In my opinion feminism is poorly named because the very name makes men feel unwelcome in the fight for equal rights. Because no one seems to realize that \textbf{sexism} hurts everyone! The men who think that feminism is a war against them... stop! Its not, its a fight for equal rights, not only for women, but for men. And for the women who think feminism is a fight for women to be dominant over a man, or think that men arent affected by \textbf{sexism}....Stop! These two groups are whats impeding progress towards an equal world where we can be free to be who we are.Because i'm a man ive been told hundreds of times to wipe away to tears, to be dominant, to be alpha. "Your the boy, go and win" or "You hit like a girl" all these things come together to make men feel like we have to be a certain way, that we cant embody traits typically found in women. Because they're driven out of us. I dont cry anymore, I hit hard, I work out, I eat a lot, etc... This is all the product of a horrible societal system where kids are taught what there roles are. All of this of course applies to women, but because I am a man its impossible for me to write down the way women are taught there roles. Although I imagine its similar to the way a man is taught to be strong, not sensitive. Dominant, not submissive. etc.. The core problem thats impeding Feminism are the people that dont understand its goals, realize were all in this fight together, dont exclude anyone or that makes you just as bad as the sexists,  the very people you're fighting against. If we dont break the cycle and solve this problem we will be stuck in a dead lock for years to come.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Have to disagree with some of the points, it seems more that Lacy thinks that men should take on more traditional feminine traits (men should become more emotional, but would it not be sexist for a man to say women should be less emotional?), but wouldn't the absence of \textbf{sexism} against men be more that men are free from pressure to choose to be more feminine if they want as well as take on traditional masculine roles? Men are indeed affected by \textbf{sexism} though, one good example Lacy mentioned is the idea that women nurture children better than men so should be given more custody, or even that nurturing is more highly valued than the discipline that traditional male role father's offer their children, or even that women nurture their children better, when surely there are women who provide great disciple and men who are great nurturers.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/147 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.361 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small So scrolling through the comments I see that a lot of people are questioning the choice of the word "feminist" rather than "egalitarian". I personally believe feminist is the more appropriate term because egalitarian has a very broad meaning, an egalitarian wants equal rights for everyone irregardless of \textbf{gender}, \textbf{race}, class etc etc. However tackling the huge inequalities between human beings becomes nigh impossible when we target it from such an immense viewpoint. This is why feminism is really important because we need to make an active effort in order to tackle inequality between genders, which is why it is necessary to focus on the issue of \textbf{gender}. This is not to say that we are ignoring or postponing other inequality issues, you can be a feminist and supporter of \textbf{race} equality at the same time and work towards those goals simultaneously. However if we want to achieve these goals we need focus groups. You can be both an egalitarian and a feminist! Remember, the word feminist is not a swear word is something equally taboo, it's simply a term that I use to describe myself and many others do too because we believe in equal rights for the genders but we are simply factoring in the history of the movement.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender, Race & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}4/211 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.896 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Trying to engage men in feminism is a good idea and a noble goal. However, saying that \textbf{sexism} is as harmful to men as it is to women is degrading to women. It ignores the social capital and power that men inherently have in the system. The system prizes them over women because they are "better." Men are privileged, and trying to change that will be a long uphill battle.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Sexism & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/70 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.429 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I don't feel any need to oblige all these pressures.

Company people decide who to give a job to, Company people are both women and men that decide what \textbf{gender} \& race/nationality they want for the high positions. Company people of both genders decide how to manage pay,  they even out a females pay with how much their possible maternity leave could cost them. I'm never against more rights to those who need them, but I have yet to see where there's great injustice. I'd love to see more female directors, writers, scientists, and other high positions, all I see are excuses. Is a T-shirt what's stopping you?  Is it some illuminati organization?

When I actually shed a tear once in a cinema a female friend told me that I am a man and I shouldn't be emotional. That hurt me, but I laughed it off.I'm kinda tall, but don't have muscles. I'm being picked on at school for not looking like a man, because I "ain't got no abs". Well, that's pissing me off. But I usually I try to turn everything into a joke.I suck at sports!

I'm probably gonna end up getting punched in the face because I'm a "fukin faget". Come on people! It's just clothes! I'll go even further: I think that it should be normal for men to wear dresses or skirts.So I told my female friend that I want to dye my hair and she looked at me with a disgust "I KNEW YOU WERE \textbf{G\textbf{AY}}"! I turned everything around and made a joke out of it. Again.I thought about asking out my crush but she'd say something like "lol ur \textbf{g\textbf{ay}}".

You could also say, then, that women's \textbf{gender} stereotypes are defined in opposition to men's and are therefore not sexist against women but against men (you see, that's what comes out of it if you apply the same rhetoric you used). For example you can say women should show emotions especially because men can't, instead of the other way round, and therefore say that  it is sexist against men.A word of advice: try to prevent such criticism as mine by making sure that your reasoning applies generally and is fair to every theme proposed, not just as a means to demagogically advocate your opinion.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}5/153 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.268 \\  \hline

The boys will be in the corner playing pile ups and smashing things. Most idiots on here will scream "social construct". Yes, it may be to a small extent. But, generally boys will be boys as its also a matter of nature and their biological make up.

Firstly, the whole "\textbf{patriarchy}" bogeyman is a ideological construction that feminists have made to destroy traditionalism.Look at the divorce rates now, look how many young boys are growing up without a father in the home. We are a generation of men raised by women - they are wondering if another women in their life is really the answer. Feminism is creating lost boys by advocating for the destruction of the "\textbf{patriarchy}".This video is ultimately an attack on straight males who love to build, fight, fuck, create, dominate, game, protect, provide and destroy.You will never get rid of masculine qualities by trying to suppress them through social engineering - there will be a backlash that will give feminism whiplash for decades. Men out there do not be ashamed of your warrior spirit, \textbf{sex} drive, physical power or emotional staunchness.

The extremists have pretty much ruined the credibility of feminism because "main stream" leaders didn't banish them from the movement and strip their title away. Oh well after having said all that maybe it would help if we divide and name the different types of feminism seeing as how not all of them believe in the same thing.1. Misandrist feminists. Extreme version and the people you see screaming and shouting obscenities, writing books on the evils of men, and are involved in politics. Some of these women are powerful and taken very seriously even though most of their views are ludicrous. They are the main reason feminism has such a stigma and understandably so.2. Discriminatory Feminists. These people are the main stream and go by all the standard definitions of promoting equal rights for women only. If men happen to benefit from them so be it. They also believe in a \textbf{patriarchy} though and are fixated with rape. They seem to want to get rid of first amendment rights when it comes to saying things to women in public that could be viewed as \textbf{sexual} and offensive. Not sure where they're going with this as there are so many implications in dealing with this issue from censorship to what is reasonable to take offense. I could verbally abuse anyone on the street male or female, but if I start saying things of a \textbf{sexual} nature to a women I'm considered a monster. Best to just stick with assault.3.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small "Pressure to be physically tall"Um, what? No one can control how tall one ends up growing."To push down feelings; to never cry."No, no, no. Men are taught to control their feelings, not suppress them. Big difference. Everyone should learn to control their feelings because it shows discipline and means a person can think with their brain and not their emotions. That's a very good trait to have. "To have manly hobbies".We do have manly hobbies. Problem is, feminists love to tell us how that's all part of toxic masculinity and we need to be more inclusive because vagina. Look at what's happening with video gaming. "To see women as \textbf{sex} objects"Because women don't see men as walking ATMs or bodyguards, right?"Harmless jabs to establish dominance".No. Men banter about with each other all the time because that's just what we do! We tease each other constantly because we find it amusing. If someone else doesn't, well, guess what. There's the door. No one's forcing you to stick around. "To be the protector...and the breadwinner."Guess what? It's women who help reinforce this ideal. This is hardly something that only men came up. "To take...dangerous jobs."Because women sure as shit won't take them because they're "too dirty". It's also why men end up earning more money, because they work those more dangerous jobs.Women are taught be free and open with their emotions to the point where they're more likely to make emotional decisions, rather than logical ones. See what I wrote earlier about being able to control your emotions. Also, given the nature of gynocentrism, women's feelings are constantly given precedence over facts because MUH FEELZ!!!No shit we don't want to be like girls because we're men! Tell me Laci, do you want to be like a man? Do you think women in general want to be like men? I seriously doubt it.

Men and women view friendships in two totally different ways, when men make jabs at each other, it's mostly to show admiration. There was a women (Norah Vincent) who dressed like a men and spent 18 months of her life seeing how life is like as a boy. Norah even wrote in her book (Self-Made Man) that men do make harmless jabs at each other as a sign of friendship, not to show dominance.Also the reason men control their emotions better than women is because women have estrogen which can tightly bind with cortisol which can cause intense feelings of anxiety, sadness and happiness. Men on the other hand have testosterone which makes them take risk, which is the reason why they are the large majority of murderers. Men can control their emotions because they don't have enough estrogen to bind to cortisol. Men are more content with their emotions.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The trouble with the term "feminism" is it lack any precision for use in discussion. The term has so many meanings it is pretty much meaningless.The first order of business in a debate or discussion is to define terms. Otherwise you are just arguing about two (or in this case many more) things. If one person one person uses the word "feminism" referring to the women's right's movement, especially post 1950, but the other is using the word to refer to some modern excess of sensitivity, then there can be no progression, no real discussion. They are not even talking about the same thing.So let's just drop the term feminism in discussion, because \textbf{nobody} even agrees what the word means anymore.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nobody & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}1/123 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.813 \\  \hline

This is why Feminism is an abuse, because essentially its aim is to undo \textbf{gender} and make everyone \textbf{q\textbf{ueer}}, or it wants a legacy where the sexes have been role reversed and swapped out, where boys are like girls and inferior as a belief actually to it- and where girls are like boys and superior- when it is examined properly.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The fact that men are expected to be a certain way is in no way because of men.Its an evolutionary leftover from when we were surviving in the wild. It is something that we still see in the animal kingdom.Women had the power of choice back then men didn't. Women were the ones to be protected because they were the ones that carried the offspring that would be the future generations.So men had to  go and do the most dangerous tasks in order to keep this cycle of life unbroken.Women chose their mates based on strength, height and muscle mass (machismo), ability to hunt (good at his job), amount of fur, fangs, or other materials he gathered (wealth), and in some instances dick size, or ability to woo by performing mating dances well (virility).These qualities were what women wanted in their men and to this day (whether or not women admit it) these standard endure and women say real men have those qualities.They are in no way standards created by men. In nature males have one imperative to spread their seed for the next generation. Men have no inherent value in nature women do.Women are responsible for grooming the next  generations thats probably why those standards endure to this day.If women started dating \textbf{fat} unemployed homeless men as a standard 80 of guys would stop working.

Women, if you don't want the traditionally strong masculine traits, then don't date or mate with those type of guys.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Open your eyes!!To open them we need to make simple experiment. Please write ‘human' and make a search at Google as images. Take a look at them… Google will show to you a lot of images but Google showing wrong ones. If you understand what is wrong in that images you can understand what is absent in the way you look or why you are \textbf{blind}…This not Google's fault, this fault is unknown.There is no creature as 'human'. !!!Human means man and \textbf{woman} together. Only man cannot define human or only women. The definition of human is ‘man and \textbf{woman}' together. You cannot see or you haven't seen any human pictures. You only see a man or a \textbf{woman}; let's make it general ‘male and female body of human'.Your talk is based on this fault. You think you are human and to use this nonsense word in your sentences is very simple for you.If you are talking with wrong words with wrong definitions, you cannot be able to think RIGHT. You are talking very easily and like a machine with very simple faults. It means you are a fault machine.My English is not good and maybe this word is not quite right ‘continuous grumbling', I mean too much and nonsense talking, especially done by women. When I say 'grumbling' please understand as it is.Grumbling is another mystery like meaning of ‘Human' and it is baseless thing done by similar fault.An idea and another idea can discuss. In order to have discussion we need two ideas contradict to each other.  If these two things are not ‘idea' but ‘information' then discussion become debate or disputation. Also I'm not sure about these words; the thing you have done at high school as competition. It is definitely not a discussion probably ‘debate' is the correct one.If one of them idea and the other one is an information then we have grumbling. Why?Information not ‘the data'!!! The data is given by nature but information is the result of what mans ideas. Information is coming from man's idea (not men always one man).Information and idea cannot be contradicted to each other as discussion between man and \textbf{woman} but of course between two men it can be. Because the man comes to discussion with the information can add ideas to defend the information. In the result ideas can discuss and only men can discuss. Very sexist isn't it.Okay let's look at the history a \textbf{woman} with an idea. Hımmmm very classic answer is at first sight, Madam Curie. Please check who is Henri Becquerel and the meaning of idea. The idea of radioactivity is not belong to Madam Curie.Let's continue to searching for a \textbf{woman} with idea. There is couple of \textbf{woman} philosopher I'm looking that area because philosophy is \textbf{nothing} but ideas. There is no need to exam their performance about ideas or are they real ideas or not. You can see the number contrast between men and women. I mean, there is no need to defend the women side by saying 'they have also ideas'; there is a reality and we need to know why…In fact my idea also on the women side, women are greater than men. But why these poor men has ability of ideas and a \textbf{woman} with better nature doesn't have it?Before we go to the reason of ideas at men. We need to close the grumbling issue. Grumbling means to kill the ideas by a creature that doesn't have the ability to create them. But women lives with them as human, everything women use and makes them feel ‘human' is done by man's idea. Grumbling is not to see the reality and disrespect to man's nature. Also every information used in grumbling is also comes from ideas. The knowledge is used by \textbf{woman} in the grumbling belongs to men; men's creation is being used against men but why. It is for 'to be equal' which is definitely not true and unfair… Grumbling is to kill the meaning of humanity because man and \textbf{woman} are not together they are fighting and this can't be the correct definition of human.It is very painful for me to write in English that is why I'm cutting deeper issues. I think you understood why man and \textbf{woman} can't discuss or have a quarrel; their nature is not eligible to do this. Of course you must open your eyes and stop being \textbf{blind} to reality.Women has greater abilities and when they are using that ability to be like a man, yes they are successful but it means they are losing their nature too. Women are better men at sight or if there is no problem, that is correct. But when we need a solution we need ideas; in that situation, women's ‘man imitation' doesn't work and that would be a fatal mistake.Please be careful for the definitions you speak. \textbf{Old} problems known solutions are not the idea and cannot be new. \textbf{Old} problems known solutions are ‘data and matched information' after it is created.Women, stop grumbling because you are cutting your own branch on the tree that you are sitting.I'll finalize the end very quick; what is the difference between man and \textbf{woman}. It can be seen on the chromosomes XX is female and XY is male chromosomes. Th e difference is X and Y eventually. Look carefully (search at Google and you see real pictures). You can say one leg of the X is detached and become smaller and eunuch. It is like being castrated.It means, something is missing at male body. It is internal producing organs and the ability of whole system performance. Lack of internal organs are created at outside of the body at evolution. This difference is started at the beginning of multi cell organisms. It was the reason to pass the side of multicell. Same cell at different conditions was the reason of disable cells by mistake. Disable to be able to produce form itself was the reason to spent the energy by action you can see the behavior resemblance at sperm and ovular. They are single cell but at result they are creating multi cell organism. I know I've cut this section very short sorry.You got to know from this part that man's body is not a complete body they are resemblance of X and Y difference. If we say XX is the total of 8 legs and XY is the total of 7 legs. That missing 1 leg man's difference.These are our bodies but we realize our bodies or we are aware of reality. If something needs to be realized it must be separated or it must be different than the other side. To be able to distinguish ourselves we need to be something different than our bodies. We call it soul. Soul is not real that is we rae able to realize our bodies or our hands or the reality we see or we touch. We have inner sounds but what believes in them. You can see the reality of your inner sound but you can't see the reality of what believes in to them like we see the inner sound. Because your soul is not real; that is actually YOU.YOU is not your body; your body  is not YOU. Also YOU is not ‘only you' it is US. Us is your soul but our soul is separated by bodies we call ‘you'. The real YOU is US and it is shared none real reality of US and that is why we understand each other as same as we understand ourselves, each other or our inner sounds by believe in them.Animals cannot realize themselves like us. I'm saying 'us' because we all know that we have the same awareness. We are naming our bodies; this one's name Kaan Onay. Our soul is saying that its belief is true because the other bodies are giving the same responds. I'm asking to you 'what is your body's name' you say 'John Smith'. Ohh it is a proof you have the same thing. But when we ask the same question to an animal,  ohh there is no answer. If the 'body' point of view animals and we are the same. But the ‘awareness' point of view we are aware of US the body is not YOU. Don't forget the proof of yourself is another human that is why our soul is US and ONE. Also SAME for everybody there is no \textbf{sex} difference at soul or in US.The True believer is our soul. Soul believes in only true accepts only truth but actual truth is its ‘none real reality'. You check your soul's reality only by asking the same awareness at different body. Animals can aware of them self but they aware of the other bodies because of simple nature.Eventually main thing is our soul is shared none real reality and it is the same on every human which mean yes, there is something same between men and women their soul.Let's finish the man and \textbf{woman} equation by adding the soul.8 legs female's complete body and full amount of soul, it is 8 nature and 8 soul.  Male body has total 7 legs and soul is the same 8. Yes \textbf{woman} is 16 and man 15 but look at the natures balance; man's nature has dominant soul or solid appearance of soul's truth. We call it intelligence which creates ideas by believe in truth or seek for truth in the dominancy of TRUE soul. That is why man can sacrifice themselves easier than women.Men doesn't want to cry in discussion because discussion needs intelligence of soul which doesn't use real emotions of bodies. It uses its another none real part to find something new to create something not exist in nature.Men show his odd difference as solid. Men turns his none real souls truth into to find or create new truths only belongs to human.I need to go more faster to finish this subject sorry.Women has the ability men doesn't have it is not to have ideas that is sickness of civilization. Women has opposite of remorse. It is another word that I don't know in English, that's why I'm saying 'opposite of remorse'. If it would be ‘conscience' but it is being used as ‘conscious' or it is like simple ‘self awareness'. No, it must be the opposite meaning of remorse.I can give an example. Man's intelligence finds nuclear energy by ideas or by his overbalance soul but by that discovery an atom bomb or an energy plantation can be built. If you let them make atom bomb you must feel remorse but if you force them to built only energy plant; then I say to you 'yes you are ‘real \textbf{woman}' and not like a man and now you used your real ‘HUMAN difference'  for the first time in the history… What is the \textbf{woman} contribution for human difference in the universe? So far \textbf{woman} we haven't seen any human activity from women in the way of choosing truth which is what our soul's believes in.Women have same thing not used in the history and with truth of grumbling it is obvious we not going good.Thank you for your time and patience for my English.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Blind, Nothing, Old, Sex, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Age - Youngsters, Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}19/1914 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.993 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small FEMINISM \textbf{GENDER} ROLES AND EQUALITY. MY VIEWI credit Laci for making this video but I don't a agree with all of feminism. Yes the so called pay gap should be sealed but true equality. Not possible is it 1) jobs. The reason women are seen as the ones who look after the kids is because it's always been that way. Women just didn't have the physical strength to do the hard labour jobs, only men did. Yes over time jobs have become less labour more computers but it's just how it's been.2) brains. No offence but people who say men and women's brains are the same are stupid. For one women can multitask better than men because they are the natural nurturers and house keepers. For example look at almost every animal on earth. meanwhile men have brains that are better at maths for example so they are better at engineering for example. 3) \textbf{gender} roles) Ok, this one is an open debate. I think that the \textbf{gender} roles we see today are natural (well 3/4 natural). The reason more men than women get into sport is because men are built to be more physical. 4)at the end of the dayIf feminism does get equal rights between men and women ( if you actually look women do have the exact same rights if even more than men do) women would start to want superior rights to men. That would happen then men would start on there rights.It's all one big circle. 5) Feminism why,why,whyIf it means equality between men and women then why do you focus on women's issues. If it was equality then why is it still not ok to hit a \textbf{woman} in self defence. Why  do men get denied custody of their child. Why are men told to walk away when a \textbf{woman} hits then but if they hit a \textbf{woman} ( which is still not ok ) they get put in jail. Why can a man be accused of a rape he didn't do and just get a jail cell. WHY WHY WHY. Ok this has been a bit of a jab at feminism after all it is a good thing (at the moment). But these are my views on it and how if it goes to far it could destroy the exact thing it's working for.Ps.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Emulation its hilarious that people believe we must copy someone, thats all good and well if its done for the right reasons. Women do shame men for not being fully manly in the way they always need to be. Men do have there moments of stupidity and gravitation towards opressive actions. I myself respect women. I want to be free to be me, but unfornately, I have suffered from being bombarded by this factor of obversive \textbf{sexism} when I was younger. A percentage of women have emasculated me to just to make themselves feel better. Hell even men have poked fun at me as well, I don't feel I should have to hide the entirety of me just because my views and social identity may suffer from not being the norm of a straight guy. I would like to cry and be vulnerable, just share my hearts feelings til im content with women.. But in reality the men and women that have surrounded me at times, have just put me through hell. I cant sleep sometimes, I feel depressed, there are days when I feel like I don't exist. I love women some much it emotionally hurts me,its more than just \textbf{sexual}, i just want matter as I think women matter to me. I strive to be me, not someone who is not me. I won't let myself become the asshole, or bad boy, or the douche bag, to win the chance of dating, loving, or just for hooking up. If we want equality then I say no shaming by women or men, lets openly talk about things and lets not use cloak and dagger  techniques to persuade another to get a desired outcomes. Freedom on an emotional level and physical level between sexes is the ideal reality.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Now, it is true that lately the unique problems faced by men and boys (that is, the problems men and boys face that are not faced by women at all, and from which quite often women find a benefit from continuing rather than preventing)  are being, at the very least, talked about more and more often in the public square without having someone start shouting about how men don't have issues and the only real issues are with women.In addition, more and more people are realizing that there is something seriously wrong with modern feminism and that its time to try a different direction than what has been tried (and what has been failing) for the past 30 years or so.  This growth in awareness of men's issues isn't really surprising when you realize that there is a clear and logical basis for complaint about most of these issues, that "men's rights" isn't just code-word slang for "\textbf{misogyny}", and that something really, really should be done about these problems.Of course divorced fathers should get as much time with their children as the mothers get.  Of course men's health issues are just as important as women's health issues.  Of course male rape victims and male domestic violence victims should be treated with the same awareness and compassion as female victims.  Of course boys should be encouraged to pursue an education at least as much and as often as girls are.  Of course men should have equal access to birth control options as women.Unfortunately, that's about as far as it goes when it comes to actually doing anything about these issues.  When you stop talking about how these issues are problems, and start asking people what they are willing to do to correct these issues, a silence arises that is almost chilling.  Such discussions are invariably met with disappointing evasiveness from the rank and file.After that initial, vocal show of support, things get a little... problematic.  \textbf{Nobody} can argue with the logic that shows, clearly, that a particular men's issue is a problem.  Even those people who don't normally even consider that a campaign for men's rights is even needed will agree, once the problem is explained, that something needs to be done, if only so they don't look as foolish as someone who denies evolution or climate change.So instead of openly disagreeing, these problem-deniers begin tacking on clauses and conditions to their agreement.  These pseudo-supporters will begin to add buts and ifs to their agreement.  Sure, they'll say, something needs to be done, but only in very specific ways.  In very specific, pro-feminist ways.  Only if the solution doesn't take away any existing areas of female privilege, no matter how much that privilege hurts men.Because, and this is the heart of the message of the modern feminist movement, female privilege is much more important than the damaging effects those privileges often have on men.Most people, especially self-identified feminists, will politely agree something needs to be done, and then will shut down the conversation with a tagged on condition that serves only to throw the issue into confusion and require finer and finer parsing of the legal details of just how such reform will be implemented.  Its a stalling tactic used solely to derail anything actually being done about an issue into an endless side argument on how something should be done.Its fear-mongering, and that's all.Fear-mongering is the traditional defense feminism uses against men's rights.  These aren't real counter-arguments.  They're boogeymen.  "Don't change the unfair law, or the boogeyman will get you!"  And if this is the best counter-argument to reform that organized feminism can come up with, then organized feminism's position is obviously paper \textbf{thin}.  There is no viable counter-argument, and so organized feminism has to resort to stalling tactics, and shaming tactics, and to slowing down progress with needless objections.  Its little more than the social reform version of fillibustering.Blocking social reform with cries of concern over the fallout of that reform is the traditional weapon of those too entrenched in their own privilege.  People who raise such quibbles may not openly oppose men's rights, but they aren't true supporters and will continue to drag their feet every step of the way.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Misogyny, Nobody, Thin & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical Features & \cellcolor{green!5}3/712 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.421 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Four things everyone in this comment section needs to know.1) Stop saying it's biology. Biology says that men may be able to run faster or pick up heavier things. It does not say that women cannot do construction work nor men be housekeepers. Biology says that men used to fight to stake out their claim on the territory and protect their families. Now we have lawyers, and civilization. We don't live in a world where it is important to be strong. We live in a world where it is important to innovate, connect, create, change, and dare, not slaughter, gather, hunt, defend, etc.2) It is extremely important to note that saying "Why can't I be a man's man?" is, well, meaningless. That phrase has no meaning because when you break down what traits that defines, and break down that defines those traits, you end up with \textbf{nothing}. "A man's man takes risks and defends his \textbf{woman}!" "What if he;s single or \textbf{homosexual}? "No true man would be single or \textbf{g\textbf{ay}}." You just used the No True Scotsman Fallacy, so you have \textbf{nothing}.3) It sucks to admit that my \textbf{gender} identifies with me rapists, but it does. I must know that if I'm walking in a parking garage and there is a \textbf{woman} walking ahead of me, I need to slow down and give her space, because she may be uncomfortable with a 6'5" bearded man walking to catch up with her (not intentionally...I just walk fast. Long legs and all). Everytime someone says something negative about men and a man retorts with "Fuck you, that's not true" you're not helping. It's more difficult but more worth it to say "That is true, and I'd love to know what I personally can do to change it". While sociological studies of men show that men are often likely to skip emotional parts of equations and jump to a rational, checklist conclusion, it is also possible to use this as a strength: men can work on identifying other people's emotions while women work on giving concise plans and directions. (And if you don't believe these \textbf{gender} related concepts are wide-spread, ask a middle school teacher (like me) and we'll tell ya: it's everywhere).4) Men do get frustrated by these debates and discussions, because they're voice is frequently left out. This goes back to the fact that we devalue emotions from men. No, really. A 5 year \textbf{old} boy throwing a tantrum in a store is way more uncomfortable to watch than a girl. Don't deny that till you see both and watch others react. Men, if you want to engage in these debates, let's do it. But first, work through verbalizing not only your viewpoints, but how you feel when expressing them.Also, "Feminism" does start with "fem" and, you know what, if that pisses you off, you're more in need of it than anybody else.Moreover, No one will ever pay heed to your argument if you attack someone's grammar or such. "Irregardless" is a word, because people use it. That's what words are, things we use to \textbf{transition} meanings. It actually makes you pretty stupid to say "That's not a word".

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I want to just say Laci, that before I just backed the feminist movement. I knew I had a stake in it's successful movement (meaning if it succeeds I succeed as \textbf{sexism} and such does affect me).But now I'm subscribing as you are the FIRST female feminist I've ever seen to actually address the specific issues that men suffer from. For instance too often do I hear something along the lines of "you don't understand what girls go through [with \textbf{sexual} objectification, rape, and societal pressures] because you're a man" which always infuriated me. I've been molested, I've been sexually objectified, I experience a LOT of pressure from society, yet so many feminists BLATANTLY deny these issues to be real. "Boys don't get raped" and "boys aren't expected to live up to impossible standards of beauty" which is total bullshit. I've been single for 6 years because I got tired of women only wanting me because I had a nice body. And now that I'm losing my 6 pack and tone girls won't pay attention to me because they expect me to embody this ridiculously impossible image.Amen to you and thank you for addressing at least some of the issues men deal with.

This is evident as female are also expected to be 'unlike men' and are pressured into doing so, which forms part of the \textbf{sexism} against women.It's just that by claiming it as a 'side effect', I feel that this unfair expectation against male (to be unemotional, strong, be told to 'man up') would be undermined.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Hey Laci, great video as always, and good subject. I would like to suggest a new topic for you; \textbf{sexual} harassment against MEN.About a year ago a Norwegian newspaper asked their readers to talk about and share their experiences about \textbf{sexual} harassment on their web page. I would say about 80 of the stories were what you would expect (sadly); women being catcalled, touched on public transport and the like...But to my surprise, a lot of the stories were young men talking about being sexually harassed by older women.I noted that it especially happening in the workplace, work related events or in bars and clubs.What are your thoughts Laci? Personally I think it's a paradox that women do the same thing to men, when they (at least should) know how uncomfortable and unsettling it can be.Much lovePern (Norwegian, female, feminist)\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Sexual & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/146 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.37 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Laci, I once watched a video where I thought you had it figured out. I followed you on Twitter and Facebook. I have since unfollowed you. This video really reinforces to me that you really don't understand the issues men face. Let's start maybe with the \textbf{sexism} we face when it comes to law enforcement. Our prison populations are well over 90 male and the only studies looking into why show a clear bias all the way from arrests to sentencing. The prison gap is so much more severe and obvious than the wage gap but it never ever gets discussed. Honestly, I can cry when I'm sad, I have a deep sense of self, and I am in touch with my feelings. I would talk more about my feelings, but I don't want to invite your feminist followers to explain to me why those feelings are invalid.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/148 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.676 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small What about the mindset of; "Any male who wants to work with a child has other motivations."Yes, today men are painted as being \textbf{sex} offenders. There are many childcare centres who do not employ males as the rule and some that do, do not allow their male employees to be in a room where a baby has their nappy/diaper changed or a child uses the toilet. I knew a \textbf{woman} who owned a childcare centres who was going to employ a male childcare worker. 9 out 10 of the mothers who have their children there, threatened to withdraw their children should any males be employed. So she had to discriminate against all males because the parents would take their kids out on the belief system that all men are out to rape children.It also \textbf{common} for men to be followed by security when they are alone with a child at a shopping centre/mall just in case he's going to rape the child. And if a man shops for clothing for his daughter, better take a \textbf{woman} with you or you will be asked why you are there as a male.Feminism has failed incredibly because those preaching the wisdom of feminism are too busy casting hate, too busy telling other women how to dress, too busy aligning with the Christian Right to demand the abolition of porn despite women being the fastest growing customer in adult shops, too busy bitching about the shirt a scientist wore, too busy telling a stay at home mother that she's stupid and under a man's thumb all because she chose to stay at home to raise her children... instead of actually dealing with the serious issues. In Australia, feminism has become a dirty word even amongst women because they're sick of it.

I grew up told don't hit a girl, hold the door open for girls and just be a gentleman. If I saw a guy hit a girl and she starts to cry I would most likely punch him right there depending in the situation. But if i saw a girl hit a guy I would restrain her because some women will be smaller than the guy and me, maybe less strength, etc. If in the case the women was taller than me and putting greater aggression on the male I would do my best to restrain her because there still is that double standard.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/165 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.606 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small As a \textbf{sexual} male who identifies as the traditional \textbf{gender} of a male, I am a feminist. Part of the reason why is because growing up I wasn't into sports and I cried a lot, and both boys and girls made fun of me for it because I wasn't acting like a stereotypical male child. I am not bitter towards these people though, I want to try and educate people so that their children are taught to be accepting of difference in our multicultural pluralistic society. I am a feminist because I don't want girls to be told they are weak, and I don't want boys to be emotionally scared because they are being emotional, and thus not strong. Strength needs to be nurtured and the stereotypes placed upon boys and girls doesn't breed strength, it breeds intellectual weakness as well as emotional instability.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Bare with me, this is a rather long post and i'm interested in thoughts/replies from the original poster.  Other comments are welcome but i'm actually interested in what Laci is actually trying to get at here.  Pressure to be muscular? There is \textbf{nothing} wrong with competition amongst boys and young men to be strong and fast.  If anything there should be more pressure to be physically fit and healthy."Pushing down fear…" Are you anti-courage? Should we avoid dangerous situations at all costs so that we are not pressured to "push down fear"? By extension of your Anti-pressure ideology should we eliminate all jobs where one may end up a frightening scenario? It's natural to be afraid if you find yourself trapped in a burning building and equally frightening for the firefighter whose job it is to rush inside to save you and/or anyone else who may be trapped with you.  Those men and women deal with frightening scenarios on a daily basis and have to "push down fear" just to do their jobs.  The same applies to many others in the armed forces, police and sheriff departments, pilots, crew men and women aboard ships etc., etc... Fear is a natural reaction to dangerous situations and it's a valuable quality for both men and women to be able to control their fears (or "push down fear" as you put it" and keep a level head in demanding circumstances.'Pressure to be into sports' What is wrong with that? Sports are just recreational exercise with the thrill of competition mixed in, right?  I already covered the need to be physically fit and healthy, but competition is important.  In real life there are winners and losers. Not everyone gets a trophy just for playing and kids should learn that instead of geting a trophy just for participating. Sports just so happen to be a way to teach this while allowing boys and young men a way to get some of the exercise our country desperately needs.  Beyond sports they lessons in competition apply elsewhere. We award scholarships to the best and brightest, they don't just hand out free rides to college or entry to excellent schools to EVEYONE who made it through their \textbf{senior} year of HS."Pressure to be the protector and never the protected" Everyone, men and women alike should learn to defend themselves.  I'll probably enrage a lot of feminist by saying this but it's not a myth that males are by and large bigger and stronger than females.  That's just a natural predispositions to strength and size and has everything to do with nature and \textbf{nothing} else. Physically speaking, in general men and the stronger of the two sexes. Fact. This point is exemplified in that it is a \textbf{common} understanding in our society that it is wrong for a man to hit women.  This accepted custom didn't arise without reason. Without loss of generality, a fist fight between a man and \textbf{woman} is inherently unfair. So where in lies the problem with teaching boys and young men to protect their families and loved ones? Why not instill that into the minds of young men, who are in general the stronger of the two sexes, that there may come a time that they may need to protect those around them.  That since they are, in general, bigger, stronger and faster, they may have to use that to protect their families?'Pressure to be the bread winner, the handy man, and the money manager' These are life skills everyone needs pressured into learning/being.  It takes all of the qualities to be independent.  So unless you're argument here is that girls and young women should ALSO be pressured into being these things then this point is completely and utterly moot. 'Pressure to pursue physically demanding, dangerous or even violent jobs' The word is a physically demanding, dangerous and violent place.  \textbf{Nothing} wrong with looking up to those who risk their lives doing work like this.  The men and women who do these jobs make civilized live possible for the rest of us. Life isn't easy, it's not a fucking cake walk, actually  its often rather fucking ugly.  Modern technology has afford us a lot of comforts but someone still has to 'get their hands dirty.'  Be it local police officers, military personal, construction workers, truck drivers in adverse climates, all these jobs are either physically demanding, dangerous or violent.  The people who take them on are the heroes of our modern society because they sacrifice their right to sit comfortably behind a computer and bitch moan.   100-200 years ago life was a hell of a lot harder and less comfortable than is today for the average person, and just because technology has advanced enough to allow for the majority of people to live safe and comfortable lives doesn't mean we should not 'pressure', as you would say, boys and young men to take on these types of jobs.  I'd prefer to phrase it more accurately by saying that we teach boys and young men that life is hard, and it's necessary to own up to that fact and that it is honorable and admirable to take on this type of work when you could just as easily pick a much safer line of work.  \textbf{Nothing} wrong at all with teaching some realism, that the world (not even necessarily including war) is a though place and you may earn some respect from your fellow man if you choose a line of work that your safety is not guaranteed in…that takes courage and that's respectable trait to teach anyone.'Pressure to be the leader and to always have the answer' The world doesn't have enough great leaders anymore.  The ability to lead is a powerful quality in a person and leadership skills should be taught from an early \textbf{age}.  Grown men and women should always have the answer, and if they don't they need the skills to arrive at the correct answer.  This happens every day on a scholastic level in schools and colleges around the world.  How you can have a problem with pressuring someone for the answer is mind blowing.  There are so many questions and so many people seeking answers in every facet of life that your opposition to this is remarkable.  Aren't you yourself championing a cause and saying that you have SOME of the answer to \textbf{gender} inequality and such?  Isn't it pressure form yourself and external force that helped drive you to publish these very videos, expressing your opinions and thoughts and ANSWERS to these issues?  Hasn't that pressure come up with answers helped this very life you lead as vlogger to become a reality? Half of your premises during the opening of this video are fluff.  The way you convey them and the context in which you do it makes its sound POTENTIALLY detrimental.  Yet if you follow most of what you said through to its conclusion you'll see that most of this 'pressure' is natural or necessary.  After that you sort of just amble off into saying society says boys shouldn't be like girls, its ok for men or women to dress as the opposite \textbf{sex}, everyone should be able to cry, \textbf{gender} roles in relationships, etc.…none of that really directly addresses your intro in a meaningful way.  WHY? Because it's something to get people attention without actually truly discussing the topics that you opened the video with.  It sounds almost like a bait and switch since you really don't dive into the topics you opened the video with and this just feels like propaganda.  This is dangerous and potentially harmful.  By bringing up topics that could have real detrimental effects on men then avoiding discussing them and instead shouting feminism has the answers doesn't solve anything or actually count as an intellectual discussion of the topic.  I'll say it again, this just sounds like propaganda by definition.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small A lot of people are missing the point of this video. (Just like, in general, a lot of people miss the point and definition of Feminism). What Laci is saying is not that if you're a man with "masculine" hobbies, you're wrong, it is that men have pressures to fit the mold of "masculine" that is unfair. \textbf{G\textbf{ay}} men, for example, who don't identify with typically masculine hobbies, are shamed upon. Both women and men in our society, to some extent, have major pressures to stay bound in their \textbf{gender} roles and if you can't see that then you need a reality check. Our society also has pressures for certain races to fit their stereotypes (asians doing exceptionally well in school, etc.). In terms of \textbf{gender} equality, though, the message is that everyone should be able to be themselves and feel like you're ENOUGH. If you are a man who is into ballet as opposed to football, good for you! No other men should shame you or pressure you into being something you're not. If you're a man who cries and is very emotional, there is \textbf{NOTHING} WRONG WITH THAT. Be yourself. Fuck \textbf{gender} roles. No matter what your \textbf{age} \textbf{race} sexuality or \textbf{ethnicity} no one deserves to be treated like they're not enough or up to societal standards. Look at the suicide rates people, they speak for themselves. We need to stop putting everyone into boxes like "masculine" and "feminine" and need to start accepting people for who they really are. Feminism is equal rights for all, the only reason it starts with fem is because when it was created women were thought of as property in the US and could not even VOTE. The aim of it is to stop assigning a picture for what women and men alike should be, and start looking at everyone as a human being.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I'm a guy and I LOVE the fact that I don't or can't cry anymore.  Emptiness is much better than feelings of desperation or depression that come from crying. I know most women are instinctively tougher ( can take more physical pain) than men due to evolution/childbirth. So I compensate with brute strength. Height and strength are as instinctively attractive as curves and boobsI just wish being \textbf{fat} was still in style( before obesity was a sign of status. Only the powerful and wealthy were rich enough to be \textbf{fat}. Now its more expensive and luxurious to stay \textbf{thin}. So 90 of women prefer some jocks six pack as apposed to my keg. But when push comes to shove I still got more energy to spend (starvation scenario).Ever since I was a little kid my father taught me that men should be ugly. That way you have \textbf{nothing} to loose if you get into a brutal fight. I wear my ugliness with pride. ( besides I happen to think my gruffness suits me well)Intelligence is definitely more important than aggression however it's important to know which one should overpower and dominate (IQ)... So when words and logic don't work its important to also be fluent in the language of reciprocative forceful pain. Most (mature) \textbf{woman} are more rational than men. So I have no problem with a \textbf{woman} with a leadership role. However they should avoid the physical fights. Women have more fragile skeletal structures. And I am against violence towards women.

But I do get seriously annoyed when boys prance around in dresses and heels and want to be referred to as Michelle instead of Michael or when a Michelle stomps around in steel toe boots and baggy pants and wants to be called mike.

I've said that a few times too.The pressure males actually face are things like inequality under the law. Bias in the family court system. The fact that we're ignored as domestic violence and rape victims when we make up half the victims (that's according to the CDC). The fact that our problems are never addressed while all we hear is how bad women have it. Did you know that it's now extremely dicey to date a \textbf{woman} from your college?

We're told all our lives that women are princesses and that we should constantly make them happy.What Laci listed is either so minor it's laughable.

Go to a sports tryout at any highschool and count the number of boys that show up and compare that to the school's male population.

It's not that cut and dry - rape is mostly about power, not \textbf{sex}. Also, I think that there needs to be a lot more education for young people about things like consent - with all of the garbage on the internet, some might not be aware of certain things: consent (and the fact that it can be withdrawn at any time), \textbf{alcohol} and drug use (deciding when someone is able to give informed consent), and, quite frighteningly, young men or women who think they HAVE to have \textbf{sex} with partners in order to 'prove their love' or be accepted by their peers or some shit.I get what you're saying, but that's the point: we try to stop murders in this society, hunt them down and shame them and imprison them.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Hannah Torbitt​ So many things wrong with what you said that it's disturbing."Teach men not to rape" is very clear about what it's saying. Men need to be taught not to rape. As if we didn't already know that. Frankly, rapists know what they're doing is wrong, they just DON'T CARE. That's why they are rapists. They lack basic decency. Because they are criminals. The FBI has even found that rapists are mostly repeat offenders and usually have a long and violent criminal history.Secondly, rape is a crime. If you are accusing someone of a crime, you need to prove it. What, you expect people to be thrown in jail based on \textbf{nothing} but an accusation?Considering that 25 of rape kits actually EXONERATE the accused based on DNA evidence, what you're suggesting is extremely dangerous.Just like your 2 statistic. I've got a news flash for you. People LIE. Women included. Did you forget the Salem \textbf{Witch} Trials? An accusation is NOT an an automatic assumption of guilt. If you're going to imprison someone and take away their rights, there needs to be proof.Lastly, the "don't blame the victim" mentality is dangerous too. Not going to parties alone and get hammered around people you don't know is good advice. So is keeping an eye on your drink and not walking alone in the dark.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Andrew Ulrich Hi Andrew.Firstly, I completely agree with your first point. Rapists are sick, sick people who need to be punished. Definitely. That's the point. As far as I've understood it, and most other people I've spoken to about it, the 'teach men not to rape' is ironic - obviously, that's impossible. Rapists are bad people, that's pretty clear. If you read it differently, then I respect that. Although I do think my point about better education still stands - many women (and men) I've spoken to, at some point in their lives, felt pressured to have \textbf{sex} - either by a partner or by society at large. Whether they gave in to pressure or did not is a moot point. It's there. We need to teach people that being coerced or pressured into \textbf{sex} is NOT OK AT ALL.I'm not saying that you shouldn't need to prove it. Women lie. So do men. And - news fucking flash - rapists do as well. Getting a conviction for rape is notoriously difficult, even if my 2 statistic is not true for all areas. And I think we need to address the fact that many rape victims also do not come forward - which is, unfortunately, why so many rapists are free to rape, again and again and again. I think that this is a problem that needs to be seriously addressed - it could be because rape victims feel ashamed, which they really should not, because it is NOT THEIR FAULT.No, the 'don't blame the victim' mentality is NOT dangerous. I will agree with you that people need to take precautions to keep themselves safe, as with any crime, but blaming somebody for something as horrific as their own rape is possibly a reason why some survivors do not come forward. Most rape victims knew their attacker. That's scary. So if I went out to a party, had a few drinks, realised it was getting late, asked a friend to walk me home to keep me safe, and that friend raped me, I might feel that people would blame me because I allowed myself to be alone with one person. But we can't go about not trusting everybody. That gets people nowhere. It would not be my fault. It would be my attacker's.And that is the message we need to get out there. Rapists are terrible people, and most of them are repeat offenders. If you are attacked, you need to feel safe enough in the current legal system that your attacker will be brought to justice. Unfortunately, I've heard too many horrific stories for me to give that belief much credence.I'm sorry I disturbed you. It's a disturbing topic, and unfortunately one that people keep arguing about over the internet because it continues to be a huge problem all over the world.And, I swear to heaven, if I see one fucking more 'Boy's Life Ruined' headline when he gets convicted of rape, I'm going to scream.

Criminals aren't the way they are because their don't know the rules of society, it's that they don't care.If they produced as many "teach women not to rape" or just stuck with "teach people not to rape" I'd buy it, but only targeting men is just plain bigoted.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Sex & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/84 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.19 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Allan Schumacher​ I find it funny that you say men need to be educated when all of the studies that have a frightening "1in X" number all have serious flaws, if you actually bother to read them. They do things like including women who have ANY amount of \textbf{alcohol} in their system to be raped or if a guy kisses a girl on the cheek, she says no and he says OK and doesn't do anything else, that's suddenly a \textbf{sexual} assault. In fact, in the original "1 in 4" study done by Mary Koss, 75 of the women she categorized as rape victims said they weren't when asked directly.Secondly, these studies also don't consider a \textbf{woman} forcing a man to have \textbf{sex} to be rape in the first place. They call it "made to penetrate" and then place it under the "other \textbf{sexual} assault" category. If you consider "made to penetrate" to be rape (last I checked, unwanted \textbf{sex} is rape) men and women are being raped by the other \textbf{gender} at almost at the same rate. (I provided links to this a few posts up) And that Mary Koss study I mentioned? Men came out even when asked the same questions the women were, but she didn't like that, so she threw those results out the window. "Although consideration of male victims is within the scope of the legal statutes, it is important to restrict the term rape to instances where male victims were penetrated by offenders. It is inappropriate to consider as a rape victim a man who engages in unwanted \textbf{sexual} intercourse with a \textbf{woman}."So it's really a matter of women's statistics being inflated beyond all reason and the men's numbers swept under the rug.As for suicide, I'm not going to tell you how to feel, but most men consider suicide when they're put in a position they can't do anything about. Guys tend to deal with emotions by doing something about it, but when our hands become tied, we have trouble with the fact that whatever's bothering us can't be fixed.If you're interested in the subject, I suggest you check out someone like Tom Golden, who's spent decades studying men and how we process emotions.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Andrew Ulrich I just happened to be reading this comment train and I find the topic very interesting. I can't disagree with you Andrew but at the same time I can't agree with you. As a guy, I can stand from where you do and see this beautiful world you've formed from your experiences growing up, a world where men are never pressured to be anyone they don't want to be and are the ones who are actually ignored while all these feminists run around rampant talking about how women are treated unfairly when in fact, men are treated just as bad if not worse. But as a guy with three sisters and a mother, I'm gonna have to disagree with you. We live in a world where women are sexually objectified. We as humans (and humans i say in the \textbf{gender} neutral sense) have created this world. Pressure exists to conform to roles for both boys and girls from the day they are born perhaps, with hospitals giving baby boys blue blankets and baby girl pink blankets. These colours are associated with the roles they are expected to fill in society. If not the hospitals, your parents will paint your rooms accordingly. If not your parents, the toys you will be expected to play with and are bought for you when you have no say at such a young \textbf{age} will be \textbf{gender} appropriate. \textbf{Gender} roles and \textbf{gender} conformity start from day one. Any psychological study will tell you this. Don't sit there and tell me pressures don't exist for most guys growing up because they do, and for girls too. I would even go as far as to say to 100 percent of them.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Gender & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}5/286 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.748 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Xeo TheNineTeenTh​ Everyone is sexually objectified. Not just women. [LINK] But worse, men are objectified for their utilitarian role as well. All you have to do is look at divorce courts or who signs up for the draft to be used ad cannon fodder. Who does most of the maintenance jobs, the list goes on.The world I live in is far from a paradise. It's just one where men feeling pressure to conform to something pales in comparison to the legal inequalities we face. It's a world where male victims of violence is ignored. Men get longer prison terms than women. Men are 70 of all homeless. Men are dying of the top causes of premature deaths and committing suicide at an alarming rate. And \textbf{nobody} cares enough to do anything about it.Maybe \textbf{gender} roles play a part in suicide, maybe not, but I consider men being thrown in a legal and social meat grinder to be more pressing. Once we get the major stuff that outright kills us out of the way, we can focus on freeing us from \textbf{gender} roles.I've also not seen anything from the feminist movement that shows they even remotely give a shit about freeing men from \textbf{gender} roles. Emma Watson's HeForMe speech pretty well summed it up. They want men to fix everything and forget about their own problems, for women.

Men are treated unfairly because they are men. Only when society stops viewing people for what they have between their legs will true equality be a viable option. I don't have any idea how to set about this with \textbf{gender} roles so deeply ingrained into society. Maybe, just maybe, feminists are on to something by telling men to stop holding onto to \textbf{gender} stereotypes and just be whoever they want to be, whether they want to study dance or engineering. The same way women should stop becoming victims of their own worldly views of how men should be and just be who they are regardless of whatever inequalities they think are perpetuated unto them by men. It's hard to support my idea with any viable arguments anyway to be completely honest, because a world without \textbf{gender} roles is quite the difficult thing to imagine.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}4/200 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.0 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Andrew Ulrich"imagine how shitty your life can get if you don't sign up to the draft"For starters, drafting in my country became entirely optional and is neither stigmatized nor give you any particular benefits whether you choose to sign up or not - this, ironically, because of feminism. When the draft became an option for women due to their pursuits, the argument was also made that it was unfair for men to be forced to sign up. Consequently, it is now optional for both."your wife divorces you because it's Tuesday"With this, I presume you mean "out of the blue"? I'm not a native speaker, and may have issues following slang as such. I sincerely doubt my wife would randomly decide to divorse me as our relation is built on communication and \textbf{common} interests as opposed to shallow attraction and/or monetary benefits - I'd know if something was wrong, because she'd tell me. Among the many things in the US that baffles me though, and which obviously is unfair, is the idea of alimony. I guess it's still necessary, even if it's incredibly lacking in flexibility, for a society that doesn't provide a proper safety net for its citizens when they fall on bad times.Boys falling behind in school is an interesting phenomena; you claim it's because they're not being "challenged", but do you have citations for that? My experience as a teacher's aide has, if anything, taught me that boys being rowdy and behaving in an uninterested manner as part of their "image" (and, conversely, their forming of identity in the teenage years) is more widely tolerated than females misbehaving. No matter the amount of times a repeated offense of just blurting shit out as opposed to raising their hand is corrected, they keep doing it. Either we're seeing entire generations suffering from worryingly large percentages of horrific ADHD or underdevelopment of the brain to the point where they cannot sit still and excibit patience in the same manner the females can, or we're allowing this very counter-productive behavior because it's normalised - that "boys will be boys". As a man, I personally know we're not incapable of behaving like civilized beings, it's not a geneticaly derived need we have to behave like goddamn monkeys, because clearly there's a rather sizeable chunk of males capable of pursuing their academia in a normal manner. Of course, once those troubled individuals are sat down, they mostly perform poorly, as opposed to excelling because they're not being "challenged". No matter how I twist and turn it in my head, it's culture, the way we are raised as men that contribute to boys being maladjusted to the world of academia, thus falling behind, and thus relying further on their rowdy ways to counter the feeling of ineptitude. What's required is more resources for teachers to spend time with these individuals, and most of all, a change in the way we systematically approve of boy's aggressively extrovert behavior in environments where that does not fit.As for my father's assholery; the \textbf{racist} and misogynistic shit he filled my head with was only actually "overcome" through therapy and education. The absolute ass of a culture that followed with playing ice hockey took a few years to scrub out of my skin, but I effectively no longer consider my value as a man as being directly derived from the amount of women I've managed to "conquer".

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Andrew UlrichMost of the western world in that sense have it wrong then. I wasn't aware that was the case in most of europe, unless you mean "the US" with "most of the western world". Scandinavia, as an example, has no such system in place, and this largely thanks to feministic initiatives (as they tend to be rather anti-war in general)."Feminists here fought for those rules." in a time where women had to recieve benefits from their former husband, they did, and many still do, as sad as it may sound. I would agree though that the system does not allow for any individually judged cases; hence my earlier comment about the lacking flexibility. I once read a case where a \textbf{woman} was given alimony from her husband in spite of having a higher income than him, purely on the basis of it being stated in the law. Your country is firmly rooted in the past, it would seem, where the laws don't follow with the times.Feminism is also fighting to break the stereotype that men aren't capable of caring for children; hell, this entire video pays homage to that by bringing up the stereotypical male as being held as emotionally distant and empathically \textbf{handicapped} and how we should be allowed to express the opposite. So far, feminism is the only movement that questions how men are raised and encouraged to be like, whilst the opposition tends to say that men are "fine as they are" whilst still maintaining that they want the same rights as women when it comes to custody of children. I can personally say, as a witness and having experienced it firsthand, that a man that falls within the stereotypical macho standards, is at best unfit, and at worst detrimental to their own children's well-being. Very detrimental."You might find this interesting."An interesting read, we've come across plenty of proposed ways of instilling learning and improving the school overall in my academia, pursuing my Masters in psychology as I am. I recognise Gurian and Sax, having read about their invovement in opening schools and writing books on the subject, but so far, the science hasn't agreed that there are actual benefits for \textbf{gender}-specific education. [LINK] In fact, the prospect of \textbf{gender} segregation brings with it an array of their own problems. I'm not claiming that this is what you're actively advocating for, but I also have issues seeing how a classroom could divide up two genders with two different ways of learning without splitting it in two for the sake of efficiency. Then, of course, there are those individuals that identify with the other \textbf{gender} more than their own, and those that end up identifying with none.The prospect is, as it always has been, that there needs to be more resources allocated to individual needs as opposed to any sweeping changes (which includes single-sex schools). Children need to be given the time and means that correspond with their particular needs as opposed to being slotted into a pre-determined slot, whether that be a one-size-fits-all version of mixed or single \textbf{gender} schooling.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender, Handicapped, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}5/520 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.962 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Andrew,I can understand where you're coming from. You feel as if she is subconsciously getting people to believe that ALL men are violent and aggressive... however; I feel as if you give me a moment of your time and an open mind I'm sure I can get you to understand some of the issues she touched on. One of the first things I'd like to make clear is she is bashing the \textbf{GENDER} ROLES of BOTH men AND women. I've met many, many men who have trouble talking about how they feel when they need to, and feel as if they have to be responsible for everything just because they're a man. I have male friends who are very \textbf{effeminate} in their behavior and are CONSTANTLY being judged and ridiculed for the way they choose to live their lives. She was merely pointing out the fact that it isn't fair to anyone that certain things are expected from certain people just because of their \textbf{sex}. You must have a pretty blessed life if you've NEVER encountered some of these issues in your life, and, if that's the case, I envy it. But, I think a more likely scenario would be that you felt personally victimized because of things you were told in your past. I mean, somebody must have said something like that to you at some point in your life to have such a deep connection with the video (enough so that you can associate it with your life, and feel victimized). I've seen the video a few times, and I was desperately trying to find where she was being sexist toward men, or judgmental... anything. This was a fruitless effort. I've had read through a good portion of what you have to say, and I noticed in one of replies you mentioned some extreme feminist organizations that publicly bash men. That doesn't mean all feminists do so. If you recall in the video she openly says, "... Caring fathers are denied custody of their children because nurturing is a 'girl thing' ". This happened to my father actually. I never get to see three of my siblings because his worthless, cheating, money grubbing, alcoholic ex-wife got custody of their children. She was very neglectful, and (despite the fact she made 3x more money than my father) he was forced to give her a good portion of his paycheck for the kids.... even though she cheated on him. My family was very poor as a result. So, no.... it's not fair that a lot of feminists target men in a negative way... however; I don't think that's what Laci was doing. I believe she was just trying to tell people that they should be accepted as who we are.... human. I would very much enjoy to continue this debate if you so choose. However, please refrain from making any insulting remarks, (as I've so often encountered over the internet) and try not to get offended by anything I say. I swear I don't mean anything in a negative way.Sincerely, The Humanist\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Effeminate, Gender, Sex & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality & \cellcolor{green!5}3/514 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.584 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Andrew UlrichHardly, the stereotype began with the age-old patriarchal system of living wherein women were relegated to duties more befitting their place in society; that is, caring for children, household work, etc. Over time, this developed to be viewed as inherent, that women should take care of children because such is their role, and men should work or educate themselves. This in turn normalized a view that women were naturally more capable of taking care of children, whilst men were not. From this standpoint, it's obvious that some women might have internalized this to the point where they genuinely believe that they're naturally inclined to care for children, and that men are, conversely, bad at it. It's worth noting that there were women who campaigned against their own right to vote. Some feminists are no doubt guilty of holding this opinion as well, but it is hardly enough to brand an entire, huge movement that has done so much good across the world as wholly negative. I gander that there are more stereotypical men and women out there that hold that women are better caretakers than men, and that men are bad caretakers, than there are feminists thinking such.However, many feminists argue that a man who subscribe to the stereotypical behavior of macho, no-pain-no-gain, empathy-hampered moronity that would rather silence their sons than comfort them are unfit for taking care of said sons, yes. Regarding this, I utterly agree. That men inherently cannot take care of children is of course absurd; but until we've turned society around to not endorse a tough-guy attitude from men to our sons, men will be viewed as overall inferior in child handling, particularly as many of them become emotionally stunted themselves by this very upbringing."Frankly, schools were rigged against boys for the benefit of girls."Schools have always been largely about momentarily shutting up, sitting down and reading/listening. Hell, this is true since the ancient greeks. The issue lately has come with the advance of knowledge; there's simply so much to learn that the school systems have included a lot more theoretical as opposed to practical learning to fit it all, instead of us globally agreeing that it would be better for the individuals going through the system if the amount of years spent learning were increased instead. That the system in any way were rigged for the benefit of girls when girls weren't even allowed the right to education from the start is absurd. Today, it just so happens that boys are encouraged to behave in, in simple terms, an active manner whilst girls are encouraged towards passivity; this in turn translates poorly in a school environment for the boys. In great contrast to today's society, back in the times when "gentlemen" was the shit, napoleonic era, composure, calm and the dignity of patience was valued among adult men, and was taught early on. Also, playing an instrument - and pink used to be considered a masculine colour in the early 1900's, but I digress.Either way, while there are genetic factors to consider, the inherent biological differences during the endocrine system's development are not so major that boys are utterly incapable of the traditional ways of learning; that is, sitting and reading/listening. Again, individualism is the greatest tool we have here; focusing on \textbf{gender} will only lead to stereotyping and generalizations that inevitably will be harmful for many, many children. If it so happens that many boys behave in a loud, extrovert manner because our society currently looks that way, it would maybe be good for the educational system to follow suit and adapt accordingly, assuming it works as well as the traditional ways. Then, it's all about keeping on the lookout for what will define a man and a \textbf{woman} in the coming centuries, and following that. But change is slow, as you know, and that goes for both society and the beurocratic elements of our educational system. Until then, we can as individuals only choose to raise our children, either in a manner befitting the school system, or try to change the system. As I consider the way boys are brought up today to be detrimental to their functioning in adult life, I'll save whatever tough love I have for my sons and instead give them a dignified, kind upbringing. If you want to encourage your sons to behave aggressively extrovert, give them the tough love that so many men seem to think their sons need, and then attempt to force the system to fit their needs, that's up to you. I can however, with some certainty, say that it will be hard for you to succeed.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/780 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.256 \\  \hline

People would ask me (not us) how the wedding planning was going even though we would both be there and they would expect me to be opinionated and my man not to be.I was so sick of the whole wedding thing because I had to tell people "no" all the time. "no, I don't want a big wedding, he does," "no, I don't care about table decor", "no, I don't want a big dress", "no, he is deciding that, I don't care" and looking at all the people's (mostly women's) disappointed faces.

It is their lives to decide what they want. People do whatever they want nowadays more than they ever had the opportunity.I don't think this really concerns equality. The world will always have an influence on people, and we should just see equality as a guide, not as something enforced that people should follow. I think it is just about listening to people, and tring to reason about what they are saying.And being aggressive and expressing dominance is not necessarily bad and will always be part of our lives. People will feel no matter what, after all they are people. The whole thing of not expressing fear or not to cry about things is an option I make.

I work with many women, and there are three of them who constantly fight with their significant others until they get their own way and treat them as babysitters, as opposed to parents. These same people shame women who have lots of \textbf{sex}, and see them unfit to be human beings.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@John SmithI've read the article, plus comments. It clarifies a lot to me. Sommers seems to be a real inspiration to a lot of anti-feminists, although funnily she's a feminist also. May I point out that the piece is an opinion piece? There's a reason it's not in the science section. If you'd like to learn more about the fallacies of the article, I recommend looking at the comments. Here's two such comments:justician1/31/2012 6:27 AM ESTGetting your research interpretation from Christina Hoff Summers is rather like getting your \textbf{sex} education from a Catholic priest. Both give you interpretation without actually experiencing the phenomenon they describe. Anyone who has done actual research will tell you that the FBI statistics reflect only that small proportion of \textbf{sexual} assaults that are reported to police. The CDC used well established questions that reflect the legal definition of \textbf{sexual} assault. What is most disturbing about this piece is that the Washington Post is giving such a platform to such ill-informed opinion that is designed to undercut much needed programs for victims of \textbf{sexual} crimes.MIndfulPerson1/30/2012 3:18 PM ESTDr. Sommers has a ph.d. in philosophy but her logic here is superficial. The Centers for Disease Control is our nation's premier agency for tracking epidemics of flu, food poisoning, AIDS, and hundreds of other nasty public health threats, in addition to developing vaccines and education programs to protect our health. To presume that these biological scientists, physicians and allied health professionals engage in "careless advocacy research" is her first logical error. I wonder if her philosophy training provides her with adequate background to critique behavioral science research methods. Much of the rest of her arguments reveal that she has never worked in a domestic violence shelter, a children protection agency, a college counseling center or any low-wage victims services job. With these limitations, it is appropriate that her essay appear in an opinion page rather than a science journal.   Working with real victims would have taught her that many victims use denial as an attempt to maintain a belief in control over what happened to them. Many also have concents over victim-blaming or fear of not being believed (as in this editoral) that motivate some to keep their \textbf{sexual} assault a secret. Dr. Sommers reports 2 numbers from the FBI and the national crime statistics bureau that are different by 104,000 - that's a lot of victims - which she does not explain. And never once does she acknowledge under reporting. In the current \textbf{Jerry} Sandusky case from Penn State, the grand jury deposed 9 victims going back as far as 20 years, only one of which was reported. Well done research addresses barriers to accurate reporting from both the psychological processes of victimization and suppression effects of social stimga in order to gather good data. Rather that address either of these real problems in conducting research on \textbf{sexual} violence, Dr. Sommers somehow manages to politicize the research, in an attempt to link efforts to reduce \textbf{sexual} violence to feminist theory. Apparently feminist theory is inherently evil and everyone know this.   Incidently, when a teenage girl is pimped out repeatedly over the internet, should her encounters be classified as rape even when she doesn't report it? And should her entrie career be counted as one rape or several? What if she is drunk or drugged and doesn't remember how many johns she was sold to?

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Lone WolfEgalitarianism has a bunch of different interpretations and doesn't necessarily mean equality for all people everywhere, although it can. According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: "As currently used, the label 'egalitarian' does not necessarily indicate that the doctrine so called holds that it is desirable that people's condition be made the same in any respect or that people ought to be treated the same in any respect." and "One might hold that equality in the distribution of resources among a group of persons is valuable, but only on the condition that the individuals are equally deserving."I'm not from the US, but I understand that feminism is being thrashed there by several media channels like Fox news. To do that where I live would be regarded in much the same way as thrashing the civil rights movement. As it would be seen as a huge disrespect to our (great)grandmothers, who went to hell and back to get women the rights they have today and still continue to address important issues.Here's an article comparing feminism/humanism/egalitarianism:  [LINK] And here's an urban dictionary definition of egalitarianism for fun (sorry if it's a bit long!):egalitarianEgalitarianism is a belief that everybody is equal. Anthropological evidence suggests that most prehistoric hunter-gatherer societies were egalitarian, and that \textbf{patriarchy} did not develop until many years after. Egalitarianism is an all-encompassing label for various forms of social justice such as feminism, anti-racism, LGBTQ, freedom of religion, etc. If you call yourself an egalitarian then you must support all of those causes.Many modern day 'egalitarians' do not understand what the term truly means and even believe egalitarianism is a synonym for humanism. They focus more on the rights of cisgender, straight, white males than everyone else which is incredibly contradictory to the whole concept. This bias stems from the fact that the majority of these 'egalitarians' are the aforementioned - using egalitarianism as an excuse to hold onto power as the most privileged people in the world, to turn a \textbf{blind} eye to minority groups and shut them down.The concept of egalitarianism is a fair one but the aim to solve everything makes it unable to ever concentrate on just one thing, leading to \textbf{nothing} be solved in the end. This is why different movements are needed to target each issue. Most Western nations are egalitarian in name but there is no "true" egalitarian society as \textbf{patriarchy} still exists, homosexuals are not given basic civil rights, the list goes on.People such as girlwriteswhat claim to be an egalitarian but hate feminism while pandering to a white, straight, cisgender, male audience. This is one of the major faults of many people who call themselves an 'egalitarian'. Feminism is equality - it is a form of egalitarianism and if you do not believe in it then you are not actually an egalitarian but an idiot using it's name to benefit yourself. Try searching up the word and understand what it really means rather than focus all your attention and believe everything you see from a bunch of radicals.They never talk about the benefits of LGBTQ, anti-racism, etc. and instead, may talk about how the minorities oppress cisgender, straight, white males (which doesn't make sense as they are the ones in the positions of power and cannot oppress themselves - this is like an almighty king feeling helpless when a bunch of peasants haven't given him some wool).These so-called egalitarians derail conversations from feminism to MRAs. In fact, most egalitarians are about men's rights while totally booting everyone else out of the image. Egalitarianism is about EVERYONE'S rights.

It's also not where feminism started, even now many people in the movement are at best ambiguous towards trans women, and feminism has left out \textbf{race} so much that there is a backlash saying feminism isn't just for white women.So I agree that men of colour, or \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} (or especially trans) men have more problems than the overall category of men.But1) that's not the place to start learning about overall men's issues2) most larger issues also affect those subset categories of \textbf{race} and \textbf{sexual} orientation2) there are a bunch of movements already starting to address those issues, where as very few movements address deeper men's issues or the underlying unconscious structures which hold them in placeYou can't learn about that in 10 minutes, just like you can teach someone about feminism in 10 minutes.Warren Farrell gives an important perspective that sheds some light on why BOTH the people at the top are men, and also the people at the bottom are men too.

Or pretty much anyone in the US.By that logic, why is any more than 5 of feminism's effort focused on the west?Because we are not that rationally compassionate. Virtually no one really devotes their life to helping the very most downtrodden in the world. Even though those people are more discriminated against, most humans are not that selfless.So does that mean feminism is worthless?No, of course not.Likewise, by looking at systematic ways in which the whole category of men are discriminated against, and the systematic ways in which women benefit, that is also a worthwhile endeavor.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Sorry \@lacigreen But you've missed the forest for the trees here. You get the superficial, but you've missed the deeper causes here. Feminists have argued that we've lived in a "\textbf{Patriarchy}" (ie the power differential benefits men), which is at best academic incompetence and at worst, academic fraud. Likewise, there have been counterclaims that society is actually gynocentric (ie the power benefits women), also false and \textbf{nothing} but a knee-jerk to "\textbf{Patriarchy}". This will be a long read, but I trust you will do me the courtesy of reading it.Before I go into this, I am going to throw out a radically revised definition of "privilege". "Privilege" is a set of conditional permissions, granted to an individual exhibiting epitomised manifestations of idealised norms, designed to glorify and reward adherence to those norms and which are revoked the moment an individual deviates too far from those norms. This will become important laterThe reality of who, or rather what benefited from this power differential is much more insidious - that it was actually designed to benefit the uterus- ie it is actually uterocentric. The fact is that the most critical resource of any society when it is in a state of survivalism, is population; without population you die out. The reality is that from a pragmatic survivalist perspective, you realistically only need one man for every 270 women to propagate the human \textbf{race}. Furthermore, at best, the female end of the reproductive cycle requires 270 times more investment than men- that ignores factors like life expectancy, maternal mortality rates and child mortality rates- which "on a bad day" skyrocket the differential in gendered reproduction investment.On the feminine side of the equation, it meant that a \textbf{woman}'s life was based around the uterus and her \textbf{sexual} choices. Firstly, society could not risk harm to a uterus and it had to be provided for to ensure it could successfully reproduce. Likewise, whilst society could not afford to be choosy about the \textbf{woman} involved in the reproductive choices, with only 1 man needed for every 270 men, society could be very choosy about  the masculine side of the reproductive process. Ergo, female sexuality was policed (while at the same time used to police male sexuality - I'll get to that later) to ensure the most viable offspring, while women were paternalised to ensure that no harm came to them and therefore that their uterus, seen as a critical part of the social infrastructure, was lost. Women in short were placed in a state of perpetual hypoagency, whereby they were forced into a state of being wrapped up in cotton wool when "things ran smoothly", relegated to the safety of the home, the "safe" work of raising children and the reproductive centres of the bedroom.It's also important to note that such behaviour was rewarded and punished, by way of female privilege. If you're scratching your head for a glaring example of female privilege, I would point you no further than the trophy wife. It is also glaringly seen in the way female child predators, female child abusers, female on male rape, female batterers and female violence in general is viewed in society (often through the lens of women having a perpetual victim pass).As an aside, I would point out here that rather than break through this mold of paternalisation, female hypoagency and female privilege, feminism in many ways has simply manipulated it to serve its own ends. Feminists have in many ways, simply turned to the state as a surrogate paternal figure to reinforce paternalism, and reinforced female privilege and female hypoagency through the notion of women are perpetual victims - to the point of engaging in not only violence but even terrorism against women such as Erin Pizzey in order to perpetuate and maintain that narrative. To claim that feminism has the answers, where their entire understandings are best described as a prima facie, is at best, misguided.Ironically, were we not so blinded by male and female privilege, we would see that men have fared even worse than women. Where women faced a lifetime of \textbf{sexual} objectification based around being hosts for their uteruses, men faced, and still face today, a perpetual existence of disposability, whereby we account for the primary victims of war, the primary victims of male and female violence, the primary workplace fatalities, the vast majority of the homeless in many western countries, we die younger, have lower health outcomes than women, have worse \textbf{mental} health outcomes than women, face glaring \textbf{gender} double standardsin abuse politics and several other issues which you have rightly identified. However your understandings of why male manifestations of femininity are so reviled, are completely off base.The fact is that you only need 1 man out of 270 in order to maintain population and it doesn't always have to be the same man. In fact when they stop looking so crash hot, you have 269 other men to take their place. As for the other 269 men, well they're not needed, so they're disposable. You can let them die on the side of the road. You can use them as fodder in wars. You can use them as fodder for major infrastructure projects (such as the 28,000 men who died building the Panama Canal). After all, you only need one out of 270 of them if it really comes down to it.Of course the problem is that the one individual has to be able to provide for and protect the offspring, so you epitomise that, whilst making \textbf{sex} the reward for it, and then epitomise \textbf{sexual} prowess to double down on the reward for it.Of course, after a while, a few lone alphas doesn't work for society and so the \textbf{beta male} is born - essentially getting the less hypergamously desirable women, also being less hypergamously desirable himself, Beta males of course, epotomise the role of provider and protector. This also involved female sexcuality being used to socially police men through their sexuality. If you've ever heard of the notion of women as "god's police" or the claim that "women civilise men", these are glaring examples of that \textbf{sexual} policing in action.Society as of a few centuries back is a glaring example of this.In recent centuries, men were placed in a state of hyperagency - not only utterly responsible for themselves, but also everyone under their household. To that end, they are held accountable for when a child or the women under their charge, acts inappropriately or commits a crime - even being fined and jailed in some cases.Much has been made of men in this era disciplining their wives, however it was a) understandable given the fact that wives were arbitrarily given the impunity of a child and b) countless safeguards were in place to prevent an abuse of power and him "crossing the line" ranging from the whipping post, to "street justice" in the case of female on male domestic violence.Conversely, if the man was discovered to be a victim of domestic violence by his wife, it was he who was punished for "failing to control his [delinquent] wife", which included him being tied to a donkey backwards or a cart, paraded around town and being subjected to having insults and rotten food at him. All of this was to serve as both a warning to other men, and a shaming tactic to make him "man up".After all, his role was as a protector (including "protecting his charges from themselves") and provider, and if he failed in that task - well, there were countless other men there to take his place.The fact is that where weakness and vulnerability were seen as a necessity in women out of a social culture of pragmatic survivalism, those same traits were seen as optional luxuries for [disposable] men who were viewed as neither needing those traits, nor being deserving of them. Furthermore, men who did embody them, were effectively shamed and reviled as decadent and irresponsible (if not criminally negligent) narcissists, who had dared to commit the heresy of rising above their station, and having the audacity to dare to claim any right to being treated as even remotely having the same worth as a \textbf{woman}. You'll also find this will help to explain why \textbf{transgender} women are so reviled by society.All of the above, in both the positive and negative, are also glaring examples of male privilege and how male privilege is designed to compliment female privilege - in a manner whereby male and female privilege are designed to mutually reinforce one another.In short, while your observations were sound, as I have demonstrated, where you took those observations with your reasoning, despite your clearly altruistic intentions, was flawed.Hopefully this comment has opened your eyes to the deeper \textbf{gender} and nuanced social understandings of \textbf{gender} and given you newer and deeper understandings from which to approach the issue of \textbf{gender} from.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Beta male, Gender, Mental, Nothing, Patriarchy, Race, Sex, Sexual, Transgender, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality, Sexual Identity - Transexuality & \cellcolor{green!27}18/1498 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.202 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@GainsbourgSerge Your dogmatic and stereotypical response is a classic example of the near-sighted and gendered dogma that is the reason why society has made absolutely no headway into tackling \textbf{gender} issues and the manner in which feminists double down on, rather than break free of \textbf{gender} norms.Both men and women have and do, reinforce normative male and female behaviour. A classic case in point of this was when the early feminist movement engaged in the "White Feather" campaign, designed to shame men into "manning up and being "good little protectors and providers", whilst men told them to "heed the call to arms" - as was the notion of women and men, trapping women in Australia between the rock and hard place of "damned whores and god's police" (originally conceived by a hegemonic \textbf{woman} I might add) - which in turn was used to socially police men in a manner which controlled their sexuality.Even when you look to the men in positions of power, their actions in those roles are designed to benefit themselves and the hegemonic women whom they have traditionally been the providers and protectors of.To deny the fact that women have been just as culpable as men have been in creating and allowing this status quo, is to relegate women to a state of hypoagency and men in a state of hyperagency, and is by its very nature, an act of both \textbf{misogyny} and \textbf{misandry}, designed to "keep men and women 'in their place' ".  It is the very antithesis of an approach which seeks genuine \textbf{gender} equality.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender, Misandry, Misogyny, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}6/263 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.281 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small "Some prominent, English feminists were involved in the white feather campaign. Further, the campaign was started by one Admiral Charles Fitzgerald, male.  And this whole idea of shaming men into manning up and being good protectors sounds like any Army commercial you see today. "Firstly, you just proved my point about men and women being active participants in reinforcing the stigmas which keep both men and women subjugated into tropish \textbf{gender} roles.Secondly, it wasn't only the UK where it happened - it happened in many other countries, such as here in Australia. If you're going to attempt to clarify, it's best to do so in a manner which avoids dishonestly. Furthermore, to get specific, the exact situation you had, was that highly prominent women who were representative of what feminism was, both to its members and to the public at large, engaged in a campaign of shaming-based \textbf{gender} objectification towards both men and underage boys - the later being an act of child abuse. Yet where were the rest of the feminist movement to publicly and visibly condemn such vile acts? Nowhere to be found.It's kind of like how feminists like you, spout the lne of "not all feminists are like that", but when it comes time for the feminists who "aren't like that" to publicly, visibly and profoundly, tell the feminists who "are like that" that their actions are a disgrace to feminism and that they have no place in the feminist movement, the silence from the feminists who "aren't like that" is deafening."To blame women for the actions of men in power is to relegate men to a state of hypoagency."Hogwash. If someone actively benefits from the injustice of others and actively and willingly condones it, they are are both culpable and complicit in the perpetuation of that injustice. This is especially true when one of the main motivations for such injustices being perpetrated is for it to benefit them.

"Right so according to your response here, the issue is how \textbf{sexism} harms men - but only so long as it doesn't hold women accountable for their part in perpetuating that \textbf{sexism}, in addition to holding men accountable for their part for perpetuating it.In short, your "concern" for \textbf{sexism} faced by men is utterly tokenistic and belies an attitude of barely tolerating the issue and only in so far that it can benefit feminism."It happened into countries which happen to be linked to one another.  It didn't happen anywhere else. "That still makes it a transnational movement and agenda, rather than an isolated one, which you have gone out of your way to portray it as." [LINK] And yet the article demonstrates that not only did those who were "not like that", abysmally fail to effectively castigate and ostracise those who were "like that" from the feminist movement" but that countless feminists who were "like that" exploited it for political expediency and political gain.Once again, you're simply proving my point."How the hell do you blame women for the actions of men?.On the contrary, what I am blaming them for, is being a party to those actions and willfully allowing themselves to be part of the ideological impetus for those actions."You can not make women responsible for the actions of men because you assume men are committing bad actions in order to support women."There is no assumption there. It is a statement of fact that the traditional \textbf{gender} role is based around the man being the "good little protector and provider". Who were they providing for? Women [and children - who were equated with women anyone under traditional social norms anyway].The women in those situations always had a choice: either accept being provided for in that matter, or demand better by way of claiming that being provided for in such a manner was a threat to their reputation- appealing to the male protector in a subjugated man. Yet they failed to do so. That makes them a party to those actions."That is beyond ridiculous."Your female privilege, and conditioned need for a victim pass for all women, is speaking here. You might want to address that." That's like blaming all whites for slavery,"And yet during the time when slavery was legalised and widespread, they were guilty. They actively allowed it to continue and failed to lobby governments to outlaw it. The reason for this was that they benefited from it - if not directly through cheap labour, then indirectly by either being able to acquire goods and services more cheaply which were made by slave labour, or being spared the responsibility of having to undertake the most dangerous jobs in society, which could instead be given to slaves.Your argument is as ridiculous as claiming that the people aren't culpable in the actions of their democratically elected leaders."You have no clue about feminism."On the contrary, I judge feminism on its actions, not on its claims, which its actions have proven to be as reputable as the election promises of politicians."

Such an approach and premise should be completely acceptable to anyone whose position was truly egalitarian.Yet, when I dare to hold feminism just as much to account as the other groups:-your autonomous white knight reflex kicks in;- you equate a condemnation of the pervasive and permitted aspects of sexist victim blaming within feminism, as a blanket attack on every women on the planet, and;- you respond to it as the unquestioning protector and provider, as if slaying some figurative dragon.If anyone's response here has been the dogmatic act of a \textbf{gender} ideologue, it is yours.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Beta male, Gender, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality & \cellcolor{green!27}8/452 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.77 \\  \hline

There are few situations when girl can wear pants in the family it is often not a good setup because when tough times come one needs to depend on a member of a family and if man cannot be the tough one , then whole family infrastructure is moot. One member of the family must provide for emotional and sensitive traits and one for tough and reliable one for kids. If you don't have kids to account for then you can do it as you like. However Even in proper \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} couples there are both sides represented. What video is saying is that family as a unit is long dead and we are in a brave new world where state and not the family is the foundation of the society. And unit of a family is inessential for human's survival and prosperity. But i think it is a rhetoric for controlled weak masses, current power structures for the wealthy still underlines traditional family structure.Tough women usually are generally entangle with guys who are tougher then them when they want meaningful relationships.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@padfootfan123 from the first link you posted in that list :'Socialist FeminismSocialist feminism evolved from the ideas of Karl Marx, who blamed capitalism for increasing \textbf{patriarchy} by concentrating power in the hands of a small number of men. One main tenet is that the family form created by capitalism (women staying home, while men work) is the main source of women's inequality, and that replacing the traditional family can only come about through a socialist revolution that creates a government to meet the needs of the family.Radical FeminismRadical feminists find the attempts by liberal and socialist feminists inadequate. At the heart of radical feminism is the belief that men not only benefit from the exploitation of women, but that they are responsible for it as well. Radical feminists believe that \textbf{patriarchy} is so deeply rooted in society that even a socialist revolution would not end it.Persons who align themselves with this school of thought identify the family as the main source of exploitation, arguing that men exploit women by relying on them to do unpaid 'women's work' in the home, and at the same time deny women access to positions of power and influence in society. To a radical feminist, the only way to end this oppression is to create a gender-free society.'So we can expect a revolution or an outright culling from feminism? Is this really what you stand for? This is insane!  Feminism sounds like the same cult that rose up as Nazism.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Sorry, I haven't read all comments, but I have a 'for dummies' interpretation of what you guys are discussing against \@SerialQiller Feminism is suposed to support \textbf{gender} equality, so there's 2 ways you can aim to balance a dominance-stereotyping tendency:1) Promoting/encouraging masculine behaviour on women (Original feminism).2) Supressing masculine traits on men (Feminism today).[The 'equal rights' part would be an ideal consequence of a social narrative revolution, howbeit the feminist movement starts decreeing from an idiosincracy level]In my subjective opinion, the idea of \textbf{gender} equality as a whole sounds good in theory (from a cultural viewpoint). But in practice, this ideal version of feminism is bullshit, because there are genetic predispositions that will always be in conflict with it. You can bear with the fact that men and women have evolved asymmetrically, yet still be a humanist who acknowledges \textbf{gender} roles and supports equal rights on a cultural level.Peace :)\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/155 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.935 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@SerialQiller How did you get \textbf{Nazi} from that? Neither description said 'How do we free women? Let's oppress men!' What I read, was that social feminists want to end the family roles to make it more equal for women, and radical feminists want to stop genders having a role in society all together. This isn't oppressing men; this is liberating women, which will also liberate men, as Laci stated in this video that we're commenting on.Does a world where women are social equals to men terrify you that much!? For the record, most feminists believe that the methods that the social and radical feminists believe in are extreme; think of it, if you will, like the suffragettes and the suffragists - with the suffragettes going to extreme measures to try and achieve what the suffragists also wanted. I've never denied the existence of extremists within feminism, to do so would be ludicrous and blatant lying, but it is also ludicrous to say that feminism as a movement is man-hating, or seeking to oppress men. The fact you're still selling those ideas after all the information that has been pounded on you astounds me! There are going to be extremists in any political movement, but that does not mean that they are in the majority, or that their opinions should be used to judge the movement as a whole, or make comments onto what the overall movement is aiming to achieve. You're playing right into their hands by doing so. And you know what, if I still haven't convinced you after this super long rant, I'm honestly giving in.

This is what feminism has destroyed and it is one of the reasons why divorce is so high.  Women are forced to take on the masculine roles that the men are afraid to be now,  and the women resent them for it.  \textbf{Gender} roles are important.  No girl wants a guy who is more of a girl than she is.  But ya,  feminism is identified by radicals more than the liberals.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@David Alexander I only read like 30 out of 100 comments, so I had no clue that you even mentioned Emma Watson. But the same fallacy can be applied by him, as you're both viewing it through different concepts. Every educated person can understand that the official-ideal definition of feminism is \textbf{gender} equality. The argument starts when in practice, self-proclaimed feminists apply a logic that ignores/contradicts/dismisses other aspects of our everyday human reality.My main problem with the ideal concept of feminism (I already gave my subjective opinion in my 1st comment but whatever) is not towards the CULTURAL idea of equal rights. I'm all for it. I believe that DESPITE \textbf{gender} roles, we all deserve same wages for same jobs, have balanced oportunities, be heard equally, etc. But I don't delude myself into believing that \textbf{gender} roles are not real in the process. I don't really care whether the quotes of "PIV = Rape" are literally accurate or not from feminists - Just the fact that they're talking about it is enough to demonstrate the overall delusion involved: You simply can't talk about \textbf{sexual} dynamics and relate men raping women with genetic predispositons, while coming from a frame of \textbf{gender} equality - If you're claiming that \textbf{gender} roles are only cultural and base your arguments towards equality on that logic, then you're doomed to being hypocrit by discounting 99 of what psychology and evolution explain about us all.There's women out there who are against contemporary feminism for these reasons.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender, Sexual & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}6/251 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.39 \\  \hline

If a \textbf{woman} wants to display typically masculine traits I want it to be seen just as respectable as a \textbf{woman} displaying typically feminine characteristics. But I also want it to be okay to be a housewife if I want to be a housewife. And the same should apply to men. If they want to be masculine they can go ahead and be masculine but there is \textbf{nothing} wrong with them being more feminine either. The only thing I want is for people to be what they want without everyone putting each other down about it. There is \textbf{nothing}  wrong with any of the things that I described or any of the various shades of gray that I didn't cover and I just want people to realize that and respect each other. That's what feminism is to me. It's mutual respect and acceptance for all humans no matter what \textbf{gender} identity, orientation, level of femininity or masculinity.

I'm not saying that we shouldn't work to transcend our biology beacuse I think we should, but if we want to change things it should be by setting rational and realistic goals and not by ignoring our inner animal nature.

So of course women will be allowed to take on the "stronger" role of men, but men certainly can't do the opposite.It's just really messed up, and I can't help but be saddened, whenever I see examples of this, like how lesbians seem to be more accepted then gays, \textbf{transgender} men seem to be better accepted then trans \textbf{woman}, even men in  general are often seen as worse and more brutish then \textbf{woman} because of the way they've been brought up to believe a man should be. It's so messed up and I really hope against hope that one day video's like these will really make a difference, and that one day people will be able to just do want they want to do and be who they want to be without any \textbf{gender} roles getting in the way\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender, Transgender, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General, Sexual Identity - Transexuality & \cellcolor{green!27}6/205 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.927 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Again, I understand that. Thats obvious. What I'm trying to understand is whats her logic, as in, HOW...according to Laci, does \textbf{sexism} hurt men as much as women? I originally said that, according to Laci, its because we're sexist against women, and therefore we become sexist against men. Because we look down so much on women, that when a man acts like a \textbf{woman}, we are sexist toward him. We, as men, try to not act like women, because we think its bad.  That, from what I interpreted, was what Laci was saying, and I got that from the examples she brought up. She even questioned "But is that REALLY \textbf{sexism} against MEN?" before listing those examples. You, GainsbourgSerge, said that this was not the case. I have asked you a few times now then, what IS the case? If I'm wrong, then how, according to Laci, is \textbf{sexism} hurting men?I hope I've made myself clear this time, and my apologies if I wasn't before.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I think I have made myself very clear, you just don't have an answer for me because you know I'm right and that's what she's implying. I never said that she said it was all men's fault, or that she was attacking men. I said that her reasoning for \textbf{sexism} hurting men was because we are sexist against women, therefore when a man acts like a \textbf{woman}, to us men, its bad. She said herself in the video that men are constantly try to differentiate themselves against women. She also said that \textbf{sexism} is trying to "devalue, belittle, or shame the feminine." Meanwhile, when it comes to masculinity, she seems to only associate that with negative things (we're always trying to be macho and not act like women, masculinity is a cause of \textbf{homophobia}, transphobia.) She could have done a REAL men's \textbf{sexism} video, that tackled real sexist issues but she managed to make it once again about how feminine= good, while masculinity=bad. Now I've seen arguments in the comments section saying how she never said that you shouldnt be masculine, she said you should be whomever you want without having to fit into a mold because of your \textbf{gender}. Thing is, she never said its ok to be masculine. She never says "If you are masculine, thats fine. My message is you don't HAVE to be masculine to be a real man." She never says that. When she does bring up masculinity, its associated with negative things. Now I will still continue to say that if I am wrong, then please, explain and prove me wrong. But if you can't, then I thank you for trying, and I thank you for this conversation.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender, Homophobia, Sexism, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General, Sexual Identity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}6/284 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.113 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Laci stop categorizing all men being evil. are you the arbitrator for men and all genders? feminism ins't the way because they demonize  men. Because they are masculine therefore its OK to to humiliate or blame  men for everything. in my family we are raised to be strong to not cry over everything. If we have a problem that is mundane we don't complain about it. When any of us  cry we know its something serious and we comfort our loved ones about it. Growing up my family would joke around about the stuff we cried about because kids cry about everything. of course kids are going to cry about they rely on their elders because they don't understand. But when you start comforting them and sheltering them all the time they become sensitive to everything. the reason why my family does this is to distinguish real problems from mundane ones. We try our best to resolve it. that is not emasculating. its funny cause the only people I actually open up to are my girlfriends, but they left me because I was honest and kind \textbf{witch} they took as being to sensitive. which confuses me because I thoguht their ideal guy isn't afraid to show affection or  honesty. But leave him because of that???? that's not only hypocritical, but superficial. so confusing. now I'm not speaking for the women saying all men are like that. Some women go through the same thing us men go through. Its not a one \textbf{gender} problem its an equal one. so you see Feminism isn't the way because all it does is cause Prejudice between the Genders. and no I never though of women being \textbf{sex} objects.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small There are biological differences between men and women that we cannot ignore. That boils down to hormones as well as physical features of strength, speed, agility, etc. Aggression, power, dominance, are all traits that lend to the survival of both genders. Ignoring them is foolish, and simply because the world is not in the Dark Ages doesn't mean we will never find use for those traits. These traits are biologically pre-dispositioned to men. Stating that we should ignore them for more progressive qualities is a little foolish. Second, men and women can never be equal, that is the truth that nature has made extremely evident. However, we can be fair. Equal wages should only apply when equal work is done. If the job requires physical strength and the man is doing more output than the women due to biology then equal wages should not be enforced and this applies vice-versa. However, if it's a job like accounting, or in the medical field then obviously equal wages should be applied. Just like women in the army do not further the cause of an army in terms of sheer strength, however if they prove to be equally as effective as the other men or even more effective then yes they should be allowed in. Standards for the army should apply to everyone regardless of \textbf{gender}. However, those standards should be more geared to the ability of men because men are in fact the physically stronger species.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@NamelessAidan Feminine and masculine are seen as opposites, so I suppose she should've just said "masculine" instead of "non-feminine." I think this originates from guys who are being less masculine being called "pussies," "bitches," "girly," "mom's boys" etc. while girls who are less feminine don't have those sorts of.. adjectives. Worst you can get as a girl is "\textbf{tomboy}" or "brute," and even that rarely happens. So you are actually being compared to girls when you lack masculinity, while we're rarely compared to men for lack of femininity.That's not, of course, to say that there's more \textbf{sexism} towards girls. It's just leftovers from stern \textbf{patriarchy}, where you could openly say that it's bad to be like women. And it actually was bad back then. You didn't have time to sit around and deal with your emotions or a chance to be weak. You had to go out and work in the fields every day. It would be pretty bad if you were overly sensitive, or easily tired, or not determined enough, or if you felt sorry for people you were supervising over and wasn't stern with them. You would be left with no food.Now, tho, we have technology to erase that need, so both masculinity and femininity are getting mixed up. It's more about what you need as a person, your psychological needs etc. We could fall under "masculine" and "feminine" definitions, but more and more guys are more feminine and more and more girls are more masculine. Our \textbf{gender} roles are now determined, at most, by our biology. There's certain need to assert dominance in guys because of testosterone and certain level of aggression, and women are more prone to empathy, but that's about it. And even that has exceptions, if those traits aren't developed by the person in particular. A guy who worked on his emotional intelligence might be less aggressive than a \textbf{woman} who's going around slapping people who "offend" her.As I like to say: Happens.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender, Patriarchy, Sexism, Tomboy, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General, Sexual Identity - Female homosexuality & \cellcolor{green!27}5/332 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.506 \\  \hline

Widows were not allowed to remarry, and the general attitude towards women was that of disdain.In ancient Rome, the church depicted women as creatures of evil - they must have a man to control them.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Ethan Hemming That's perfectly fine, but you shouldn't force it upon anyone else. If another man doesn't want to be dominant, for whatever biological/psychological reason he shouldn't be called a "\textbf{pussy}" or whatever. And if a \textbf{woman} doesn't want to be submissive she shouldn't be disregarded as unattractive or playing hard-to-get. You can say she is unattractive to you because it's not relationship-dynamics you like, but you shouldn't exploit your social dominance to forbid your friends from dating her if they want their social lives in one piece. Pretty much, everyone has the right to their own preference, but not the right to force it upon others - by insulting, bullying, or simply claiming that's how they "should be." After all, we're all unique and our psychological and physiological development can lead to all sorts of social and \textbf{sexual} needs that don't need to fall in line with everyone else of the same \textbf{gender}.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender, Sexual, Woman, pussy & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General, Nationality - Chinese & \cellcolor{green!27}4/154 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.597 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@HyperOpinionated About the \textbf{sexual} dimorphism thing? \textbf{Sexual} dimorphism refers to the biological difference between the sexes. Physical biology can be affected by an organism's environment and behavior. Behavior is largely cultural. There had for a long time been a large cultural stigma against women ever competing in athletic events (because of some bullshit about their uteruses falling out). Because women are now gaining access to organized sports and physical training, the physical difference between strength and mass of men and women is shrinking.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Sexual & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/83 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.41 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Corbinite Of course that a taken \textbf{woman} can be stronger and heavier than some given man, but if you imagine ideal man and \textbf{woman} with ideal health and potential for development, I think we'd agree who'd have more potential. It's not that \textbf{sexual} dimorphism is decreasing, it was always this low, we're just starting to see it now.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Sexual, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/58 & \cellcolor{green!5}5.172 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@DeathRipper97 In this case I'm referring to \textbf{sexual} dimorphism of secondary (or even tertiary) \textbf{sexual} characteristics, so I can see how based on one's definition of \textbf{sexual} dimorphism, it could be perceived as static or decreasing. But the reality is, as men and women are allowed to participate in the same activities, strength and mass even out. Of course men will on average be somewhat stronger. We have more testosterone, which favors muscle building, and we typically have larger nostrils, allowing more oxygen to be transported to the muscles, but that doesn't mean that our perceived difference between the sexes hasn't been massively exaggerated by our culture.Also, what do you define as an "ideal man or \textbf{woman}" because I don't think there really is a such thing unless you believe in intelligent design, in which case I can't argue it. Evolution doesn't produce ideals, nor does it provide a description of what an ideal should be. People are who they are, and if their biology doesn't independently push them towards or away from athleticism, then there is no reason why women being just as athletic as men should be a bad thing.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Sexual, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}4/193 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.073 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Corbinite On the first point, I agree.As for the second, I meant both don't have tendency to developing an illness genetically from practicing athletics, both are healthy regarding functions needed for athletic activity, both have been regularly practicing athletics for the same amount of time and both are of similar build. I hesitated to use "average" in place of "ideal" because average is limited by society standards which, although they're decreasing, haven't disappeared completely. I don't believe in intelligent design, no, nor do I believe that an ideal case exists, I'm just asking of you to imagine it. Our imagination goes beyond realistically possible things. The reason I'm asking this of you is that I think a sample from our current reality wouldn't be good for any sort of study regarding genetic influence of \textbf{gender} on strength, because it's too socially corrupt, so I'm just having you imagine something that might happen someday.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/154 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.649 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Gender roles are not sexist. They are what they are. I agree that \textbf{gender} roles are BS, but I don't think they are sexist; both sexes suffer from \textbf{gender} roles and stereotypes, and feminism is merely attempting to give women a pass on  those while creating new untrue stereotypes such as "all men are oppressive, sexist perverts" and "all women are innocent, helpless victims". THAT, my friends, is \textbf{sexism}. Besides, in today's first-world countries, feminism is completely obsolete. Go to Afghanistan or Africa to promote women's rights and I will take up the charge and fight alongside y'all. But here in America, women have all of the same rights and responsibilities as men, plus a few extra benefits, just because they happen to be born female.Don't believe me? How about how 90 of divorce cases side in favor of the \textbf{woman}? Or how women can collect both alimony and child support? How about the double-standard where men that take off their shirts are considered rude, whereas women who wear revealing clothing are just expressing themselves? And how if a \textbf{woman} is caught checking a guy out, it's flirting, but if a guy is caught checking a girl out, he's a pervert?The essential problem with feminism is that it makes women into victims, which allows them a whole whack of special privileges just because they get to play the victim card. We need to stop this sexist BS immediately and focus on promoting \textbf{GENDER} EQUALITY, not on empowering the already over empowered \textbf{sex}.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender, Sex, Sexism, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}8/254 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.15 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Laci, you are literally one of my favorite people on YouTube. I love you so much. And I feel sorry for the people who don't understand what you are trying to say in this video, that \textbf{sexism} effects everyone, and that feminism DOES NOT equal \textbf{misandry}. I feel sorry for the people who can't get that through their thick skulls. I used to get bullied all the time in high school for being "feminine". For being short, weak, shy, and not into sports at all. For showing all of my emotions in public. For breaking down and crying in front of my class because I was going through a difficult time or for being overly embarrassed. For liking a show with magical and colorful ponies in it (My Little Pony), even though it has great and thought provoking stories, and great and deep characters. I didn't care if they were colorful ponies, they could've been badly drawn cartoon characters and I still would've loved it. And it wasn't just guys that teased and bullied me for these things, but girls too. I was told constantly that I would never get a girlfriend because I wasn't "manly" enough. I wasn't talk or strong enough. Even adults said things like this to me. My teachers told me to get my head out of the books and start lifting weights if I wanted to get a girlfriend. And for a while, I believed these people, because I have yet to kiss a girl, let alone be in a relationship with one. Because when I get rejected by a girl when I ask her out, while I respect her decision to say no to me, I still end up breaking down and crying. And when I did, news about me crying would spread like wildfire, and I would be labeled a "wimp", a "\textbf{pussy}", "overemotional", "overdramatic", a "crybaby", and a lot of other hurtful terms. This is the kind of \textbf{sexism} Laci is talking about. It is a real thing, and it doesn't just affect women, it affects men too. So please, don't be mean to someone just because he doesn't fit into a specific role that's been drilled into your head.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Two things stuck out to me. The implications that masculinity can lead to \textbf{homophobia} and trans-phobia. I read both links, the \textbf{homophobia} didn't seem to site any sources or give statistics, and the hate crimes against trans-phobic didn't give much information (the report isn't capable of being downloaded).As to whole video in general, I am somewhat dissatisfied that what would be considered masculine traits are the only main focus of this video relating to \textbf{sexism}. It's true that they can be a detriment if exaggerated too much, but it could be said for feminine traits as well.Being able to express emotions is certainly beneficial, but it can also get in the way of more critical thinking. Same with crying, it's a natural thing for the body to do, but at the same time, given the situation you are in it may be best to "suck it up" for the time being and carry on. As for physically intensive jobs, it's a really a matter of "someone's got to do it". I can't say I have ever been pressured into it, but I know it would serve people better to use my innate strengths to aid them. Which ties into being the protector, most people don't want their hand held all the time, that I can concede, but if I feel like it would be helpful, I'll do the best I can to assist them. Now as to the "playful jabs" bit, that I can attest to. While some guys might think it's just a simple joke, it can really feel ostracizing to the receiver if it's excessive.That being said, I think a lot of it may tied into how \textbf{old} they are, mainly concerning how mature they can be. I have been on the butt's end of plenty \textbf{homosexual} implications in my middle school years, which led to a kind of epiphany on how poorly real \textbf{homosexual} people must have been treated. So a silver lining can be found in one form or another.

They can hold the same values as them, be equally as smart, be interested in the same things, understand them, but God forbid a man dares to wear make-up. He's automatically socially dead. And that's the pressure those people feel. A pressure of being accepted only under the condition that they don't act upon some feelings they have. And that's how they're pressured into not doing it.It was a bit of a exaggeration, but still, if someone shows emotions, like crying in front of couple of friends, if it's a girl everyone will be sorry for her and if it's a guy almost always at least one person will make fun of him for being a "\textbf{pussy}" (another reference to it being bad to be like a girl). Of course, there's a lot of groups of friends where this wouldn't happen and where reaction would be equal, but I think there's more of those who think men have to be those badass feelless things and prove that they're so powerful compared to others for not facing their feelings. In my eyes, the one who deals with feelings properly in due time is powerful. They don't have to cry, I rarely cry myself as a girl, but they shouldn't ignore their feelings either, they should feel free to talk about them and cry if they feel the urge to.And of course, you can choose to be "masculine man."

I do cry, sometimes when I'm really stressed out I just take it out, out of the blue, seemingly with no reason, but it happened like three times in my life. I don't cry to movies/comics/anime/manga/games/books/whatever with exception of One PIece, which I have a soft spot for. And now you'll proceed to tell me that I'm not a girl because of all of that, because I don't fit what you think about girls? Last time I checked I had a vagina and I identify myself as female in regards to \textbf{gender}.As for being called a \textbf{pussy}, I saw it. I initially thought \textbf{nothing} of it, but when you think about it, where did the term originate from? Antifeminists always complain that "fem" is in the title. Well, as you know that fem initially originated from "feminine," you know that \textbf{pussy} originated from vagina and comparing someone to girls. But I see you know a lot of sociology and linguistics as well, so much, to be precise, that you're able to analyze origins of phrases really in-depth. But of course, I must just be "overdoing it" because I'm a girl?As for being masculine, I did say some parts of it aren't particularly healthy, but it's your choice. Not letting your emotions out isn't healthy. Giving away jackets around isn't healthy. Some sports are quite dangerous, as well as some \textbf{crazy} dares (I'm a dare person, tho, I'm not judging anybody, I'm just saying it can be dangerous).Some aspects of being overly feminine are unhealthy as well. Being overly dependent or constantly demanding to be treated as some fragile little flower doesn't do good to your confidence and maturity in relationships (I don't mean romantic relationships, relationships in general). Being overly sensitive and emotional can cloud your judgment and have you make bad decisions.The \textbf{thin} is, all of that is just what we figured goes with definitions of a man and a \textbf{woman}. To be honest, I think \textbf{gender} has little relevance to your personality. I'm a huge MBTI-addict, it's a psychology theory where you have 16 types of people based on extroversion, introversion, do they perceive or judge things, do they use intuition or sensing for perception and thinking or feeling for decisions. Girls might be ever so slightly more likely to be the types who use sensing and feeling, and that might be the cause for stereotypes to arise. I'm intuitive thinking and thus very annoyed at all the perception people have of girls.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Crazy, Gender, Nothing, Thin, Woman, pussy & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Gender - General, Nationality - Chinese, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments, Physical Identity - Physical Features & \cellcolor{green!5}8/467 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.713 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@marv34001 Well, if you actually really never happened to be pressured into your \textbf{gender} role, then that's awesome. I have been, personally, but I guess it might depend on how developed society you live in is. I have had people come at me for not acting "feminine" in some ways (not wearing make-up, not watching movies like Twilight, not drooling over actors/singers, not laughing at others for their looks, not wanting to spend hours looking up random people's fb profiles so they could gossip about them, not putting ridiculous Photoshop actions on photos). I was an outsider, unattractive, uninteresting, unintelligent even because I didn't do stuff other girls did. People seem to be getting more tolerant with \textbf{age}, but I've learned it's more the matter of learning not to express their intolerance.As for openness, I suppose you might be right. I'm quite an open person myself, but that's because I don't feel very vulnerable even if someone knows me to the bone. Unless I care about you, you are hardly going to hurt me, and if I care about you I can usually trust you with my feelings to a degree. But I suppose I'm fairly... okay? I'm a bit lazy and tend to be quite stressed out when I don't manage my deadlines, but that's about all you can play on. I've dealt with my past, I'm still dealing with some fears, but I doubt anyone could exploit them. Now that I think about it, it's probably just the matter of being extroverted or introverted. But it's about 50:50 on that one, so a lot of people need others for their introspection more or less.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Gender & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/277 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.722 \\  \hline

And if I'm the opposite, then I'm not a girl? I, personally, never expressed to you that I disliked sports, was easily offended, cried a lot or anything. You assumed that based on my \textbf{gender}.And that's what I was referring to about perception of women, what you described us to be previously.As for testosterone, which is actually a valid argument, yes, it's normal for guys to have a higher need to assert dominance and to be slightly more aggressive thus more prone to playing sports and cheer for sport teams in order not to become violent in a negative way. And that's about it, that's what I give you. It doesn't make you better at sports. Maybe you have more potential, you are genetically stronger, but that doesn't mean you'll work to develop to your full potential. You might not be better in a dominant position, or a specific \textbf{woman} might not be comfortable with it. It boils down to figuring what works for each one of us, and each one of us should be given a chance to be whatever they want to be. Including masculine men and feminine women. And if you've, personally, been given that chance, I haven't, I had to fight for it, and I don't want everyone to have to fight for it in every generation.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@marv34001 Depends from what perspective you look at free will. What we do know is that we are a product of genetics and the environment we are brought in. Personality forms within the relationship of your genetics (DNA Code) and what you are taught first by your parents and then by your immediate environment. As you expand your environment you shape yourself more and more (based on your environment, but there is only so much you can experience and learn in the world, which is why people tend to stay stagnant within their believes and way of thinking- it's like forming a bubble. And what is presented to you within the environment you are raised in is what becomes your basis of who you are. And the environment which is society/culture at a large point of view has been created to fit a certain norm. The norm itself is very interesting as it reflects our minds collectively as we move through time. And usually we tend to cycle which is why history repeats itself in one way or another. NOW- breaking the cycle (changing the basis of who you have become) is what I would call free will- which is building an awareness of how and why things exists as they do and how they were created on the first place. It is questioning yourself, your patterns, your believes, your behavior, your reactions, your very personality design and starting to see things from a practical perspective rather than a "programmed" one. It is accepting self responsibility for collectively creating a society/culture/environment that promotes inequality in all kinds of ways and for the very least accepting inequality to be a norm. It is learning, re-educating ourselves that we are able to create a society/culture/environment that has the foundation of equality by removing competition/survival/stereotypes/inferiority/superiority, \textbf{gender} roles...and starting to see how we can be practical and supportive of each other. In the particular case of \textbf{gender}, it is to embrace the feminine and masculine as an expression of ourselves from a physical perspective as well as \textbf{mental} and starting to assist one another instead of fighting against each other. Do you realize how this would change the dynamic of relationships/sex? Anyhow, this is a broad perspective and there are many more dimensions that can be explored within this topic. But here is a question for you- When I was in Japan back in 2010 there was a cart on the train designated specifically for women in the morning hours of traveling because the trains got too crowded. And there was a protest from men as to why did women get a whole cart to themselves. The men in the protest saw this as inequality towards them. Now my question to you is why do you think- men did not get a cart to themselves and women did? Is that presenting inequality towards men? I know the answer, but I would like to hear your thoughts on this. :)\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender, Mental & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}3/495 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.606 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Antoaneta Grodskiy Man what a response. Free Will is the ability to choose your actions. Now I'm not saying society does not have a role in how we use that will. There are what would be trends, especially in \textbf{gender}. For example females wearing makeup. It is mostly used by women, it is mostly sold by women to other women, and from there its a snowball effect. Now like said before when a trend or habit becomes so popular it becomes a norm. Like a man wearing pants. And when people break norms that a very very large majority of the population does then people react oddly. But these people cannot oppress others legally, and no one has to be a part of norms. And not to mention there are not any norms that come with \textbf{gender} other than clothing. Because these days we know that there are different personalities and versions for each of the genders. Damn before reading your comment I watched a news story about a female fire fighter, it didn't matter that she was a particularly masculine at all, it didn't even matter that she was female. And because of this we have achieved equality, unless you are speaking of the \textbf{L\textbf{G\textbf{BT}}} community. Now for your story it depends, are the women in a greater danger then men in the situation? Will the men get there pesonal train if they're in a similar situation? And if the answers is yes then maybe the problem is great enoug that particularly women need protection from threat,  just like a \textbf{black} person would need protection from the kkk do his or her \textbf{race}. If the answer is no and the threat is not great, these women are not in constant danger then yes they're getting special treatment for \textbf{nothing} and this is an inequality among the genders.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Gender, LGBT, Nothing, Race & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General, Sexual Identity - General, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality, Sexual Identity - Transexuality & \cellcolor{green!27}8/308 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.597 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@marv34001 Yes, the women got a cart to themselves because they were being sexually harassed  by men in the crowded train- like being felt on and touched by men (without permission) who thought it was appropriate that somehow sitting close to a \textbf{woman} gives a them a right to sneak in a touch making women uncomfortable. It must have become a big issue if the cart was created as to solve the problem from a certain perspective. Now if men were the ones getting touched and harassed by women I would agree they would need their own cart, but since it is more \textbf{common} that men sexually harass women it is the other way around. And then the other way to look at this is would a man feel harassed if a \textbf{woman} was touching him without permission, or would they say "it is my lucky day"? How is a \textbf{woman} viewed for sexually harassing a man? Is it \textbf{sexual} harassment if the man is "OK" with it? Why is that women are the ones uncomfortable for being touched without permission? Why are more women objectified than men? Why do we objectify on the first place men or women? Why did the men protest to when the women got a cart? Is it because they would not be able to touch women, or is it really that they felt discriminated against? Those are some of the questions I would ask to explore this. Then the problem goes deeper because you would have to ask yourself why do we have more men than women that explicitly show \textbf{sexual} desire and would act upon it on public places? Was that conditioned by the media? Imposed by \textbf{gender} roles (that the men scores when he has \textbf{sex} with many women and the \textbf{woman} has to have the walk of shame)? That maybe throughout history women were considered baby makers and their opinion did not count? Why is it that we have more prostitutes than gigalos (lol I think that is how you spell it)? So looking at how \textbf{sex} was portrayed towards men and women through history would give some answers. And then again why have special carts for anyone if we would just target the issue at it's very core- teaching sexuality and respect to both genders, how to have a healthy \textbf{sexual} life, how to treat each other, handle our \textbf{sexual} desires in a healthy way and change how history has presented \textbf{sex} and \textbf{gender} in culture.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Common, Gender, Sex, Sexual, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}14/416 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.365 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Antoaneta Grodskiy To be honest I've heard about that problem in japan. And this always seemed to be my solution in my head because \textbf{nobody} is harmed in anyway. But as a teen I can honestly say I wouldn't mind if I was being ya know. This is beause men are more sexualy aggressive than women. I don't think this is because of anything society does because \textbf{nothing} I have seen promotes or encourages \textbf{sexual} aggressiveness, I have however seen things going against it. And I'm not saying we don't encourage \textbf{sex} because that would be foolish. Now if a women sexualy harrasses a man it's still \textbf{sexual} harrasment which is wrong, but if it is welcomed and is not offending the other person,  same goes for man and women. But in my opinion it shouldn't be done in the first place. As for objectafacation its not a problem for men and women. It harms no body and exploiting sexuality to sell things or promote does not mean there is some huge problem. Personally when I buy underwear I don't like seeing the guy with a huge erection on the cover. But I know its meant to catch my attention. Now as for treating somebody as an object thats wrong but thinking about someone as \textbf{sexual} attractive, which is in a way objectifying is fine and reasonable because you don't actually know that person. Sorta reminds me of female and male celebrities. And being publicly \textbf{sexual}, appropriately or inappropriately is seen as bad in my eyes and I'm pretty sure the eyes of most people because being \textbf{sexual} is supposed to be private. So a man doing this in public is definitely wrong socially and lawfully.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small It is also sexist to insinuate that somehow it is improper or inappropriate for a man (or \textbf{woman} for that matter) to desire to be an alpha, to be the one with the answers, the be the bread winner, to be the protector, to participate in social pecking orders (jabs for "dominance" as you put it, I'd call building of commradery amongst friends), etc etc.  It is also sexist to say that it is about shaming, belittling, and devaluing the feminine (it is about doing these things to EITHER masculine or feminine).Look.  I am a HUGE supporter of equal rights and empowerment of both sexes/genders.  I am immensely glad that women's rights were (mostly) worked out before my generation.  I am heartened to see the desire of males to embrace the feminine is being accepted by society more and more every day.  I am, however, dismayed that the topics of \textbf{sexism} and feminism still seem to center around implicit (and to an extent explicit) disparaging of the masculine and playing the victim as the sole source of empowerment for the feminine.  All this does is label, divide, and create new problems.  I genuinely tire of this because it hearkens to the same 3 male stereotypes under the auspice of lifting up women (and in videos like this, men).  These stereotypes are the doofus  incompetent (Jack Griswald from National Lampoon), the alpha (Liam Neeson in Taken), and the \textbf{effeminate} (see every \textbf{Q\textbf{ueer}} Eye For The Straight Guy type reference).  It is getting better.  More and more people are approaching this from a "and let men be who they want, too" perspective.  The problem is that this perspective is willfully disparaging of quite a few traits which come naturally to the male \textbf{gender}, both from a psychological source and a biological source.  In short, as you pointed to at the end of your video, we need to embrace both the masculine and the feminine.  People need to be free to live as they choose.  But this can not be achieved so long as a movement disparages or delineates a difference between groups, be it by intent, neglect, or accident.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Effeminate, Gender, Queer, Sexism, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General, Sexual Identity - General, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality & \cellcolor{green!5}6/359 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.671 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small 1:49 - 1:53 - Custody. I do find it very interesting that you state this issue as one feminists are trying to help with, and link to an article that blames any form of bias in the forms on "the patriarchal notion that men are not meant to be caregivers and that women are not mean to breadwinners". Now, if we go back and look at history, you will find that in places such as England, the father always gained custody of any child in the case of a divorce. If you continue on this trend you will find that it was a feminist, Caroline Norton, who began the campaign for women to have the right to custody. This is how we got such acts as the Tender Years Doctrine, and Custody of Infants Act of 1839. The Tender act merely switched man for \textbf{woman} in the case of children 0-4, meaning that instead of the man getting custody, the \textbf{woman} was awarded custody. Now, with all that being said, blaming "the \textbf{patriarchy}" and "patriarchal notions" for an issue instead of the actual facts is being dishonest. It was not men that decided that women should gain custody of children aged 0-4, it was a \textbf{woman}, a feminist. Not the \textbf{patriarchy}, not any form of belief from a man, but an idea put forth by a female feminist.  Also, since a \textbf{patriarchy} is a social organization in which the father is the supreme authority of the family, it makes \textbf{zero} logical sense to say that a \textbf{patriarchy} would value a mother over a father in cases of child custody.2:49 - 2:57 - Power, dominance, and aggression, the traits that get men to the top of society, which is ironically something you and other feminists have complained about time and time again in the form of "not enough women politicians and CEOs".Dominance means to be in control, without dominance you would have no leaders, no CEOs, no bosses, no authority. The opposite of dominance is submission, not respect, you can be dominant and still be respectful to others they are not mutually exclusive nor are they opposites. Lack of power would result in very similar terms as a lack of dominance, lack of leaders, lack of order. Being in power means you have authority, command or control of others, such as a government, or even a police force. What prevents murderers from killing the entire country with no end in sight? Laws from the government, and the power given to police to arrest and possibly even kill the murderer before the murderer wipes out 100's, 1000's of people. Without a centre of power, people would have freedom in the purest form, which means that while a person is free to dance on the streets naked, it also means that a person is able to kill without any source of repercussion. As long as you have some type of law, or someone imposing their will upon another person, whether it be to not kill or to not go out after 6 PM, you will have someone in power. Power is not a purely negative trait.Aggressive, competitive or boldly assertive, is not the same as violent and again is not the opposite of non-violence. Violence is the abuse of power, or using physical force to damage others, which is not the same as being aggressive as stated above, the opposite of aggressive is passive. On the small scale it helps in sports do everything you could possibly do to win the game, it creates entertainment and a need to better yourself to do better than the other team in cases where you lose. Being aggressive can help you develop your skills, to aim higher, to better yourself in whatever area you choose. On the larger scale, it is feudal barons drew up the Magna Carta, confronting the king of England, and putting limits on his powers. This form of aggression is what led to constitutional law, it advanced society beyond the law of a tyrant, into a new realm of thought. You say at the end of your video you want people to be a "full dynamic human" while demonizing traits of humanity that you think should be replaced by other traits. Power, dominance, and aggression, are not sick or negative traits. They are traits that can be used in a positive or negative manner like many other traits that humans contain. If you want to teach people not to value power, dominance or aggression, then you should note all of the positive side that you will lose out on, as well as the negative side, not just one, but both sides.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Patriarchy, Woman, Zero & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}8/782 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.023 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I do find it interesting, though this is a big "MRA" baby of "Fathers don't get custody" And this is where I disagree with MRA... because statistically of the fathers that WANT custody and fight for custody vs women that WANT custody and fight for custody.. it's about even who gets custody when both parents are "fit" to parent...Where the statistic gets skewed is that most men choose not to fight for custody... That's a fact.. I don't agree with it, but most men choose not to fight.. In reality where I refuse to call myself a feminist is the baggage that comes along with the "feminist" label. I can believe in equality while I don't have to call myself a feminist... and the great thing about that is no one assumes what I believe based on a label.That said, I agree with a lot of what you have said...  and While the ideal is great in what Laci says... You don't need feminism to believe that way. Just like you don't need a Church to believe in God.. you don't need the Bible to help you believe in God either...You have "Equality"... the main goal of almost everyone.. the vast majority believes in equality and that both genders should be equal and the same opportunities as the other...

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Laci, this is one of your most offensive videos.  I had high hopes for it when I saw the title, thinking you would finally address some male issues.... but then it became immediately clear that this is only the feminist view of men's issues.  These aren't really the major issues that a lot of men face, not what I faced, this is just what feminists want to believe because it fits in with THEIR narrative, their agenda. Rather than actually listen to men, feminism will tell us that, 1:08 ""\textbf{sexism} about shaming, belittling, and devaluing the feminine.  Notice how many of the pressures boys face come down to defining themselves against women.".  NO!!!  That's not true, that's just the load that you've bought in to Laci!!!  I did absolutely notice how you took the topic of \textbf{sexism} against men and twisted things to be against women because that is the feminist narrative....... which I find quite sexist.And that is what is so frustrating about you and videos.  That you don't see the obvious.  You make these videos and you think you're speaking truth.  This isn't truth, this is just your biased take on things.  You believe that women are victims, and that masculinity is toxic, and against women.  This is very sexist.  Even when you think you're being anti sexist, it's like you're even more sexist.Sure, maybe SOME men are damaged by some of the issues raised, but those aren't the issues I faced, personally, nor are they the issues that a lot of men faced.  I will tell you that a major issue I faced is being devalued for being a man.... and I feel that most of that devaluation was done by feminist thought!  I feel that feminists are telling boys that it's actually not ok to be masculine, men are taught to repress their masculinity.  That to be a man is to be overbearing and a jerk.Listen Laci, how about instead of making a video about how men are victims, and how too much masculinity is damaging, why don't you make a video that is actually PRO MASCULINE!!!  Yes, talk about how masculinity can be a POSITIVE force in the world.  What is it that you APPRECIATE about men, or masculine qualities.  With feminism, it's always about what people are doing wrong, and how masculinity is toxic, and how femininity is attacked.  Feminism made me feel ashamed of my own existence.  To feel that to be attracted to a \textbf{woman} means you're objectifying her, and you should be sorry, and that you're practically committing a small crime by bothering women slightly. This is my experience.  But of course, in your feminist class they'll teach you that men are being damaged by the expectation to "be tough" or whatever.  When are you going to address the potential damage that feminism causes?  Yeah, I guess some people might be damaged by the expectation to be overly "tough".  But you know what, a lot of people might be damaged by NOT being encouraged to be tough.  Sometimes "being tough" encourages one to build character.  Feminism never talks about that.  Feminism assumes that "masculine" traits are damaging.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Sexism, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/529 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.567 \\  \hline

Thus you showed me that you're not just a troll or a narrow minded jerk, good. But then again you didn't get what I tried to say here.Ok, if we were talking about domestic violence, that is when one regularly abuses verbally, emotionally or even physically one's spouse, right? Then it is safe to say one is bullying one's spouse. Bullies don't prey on people they consider as equals in any level, be this concept of inequality in their heads or social standards. That is why you see \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} people getting bullied, \textbf{fat} people, \textbf{skinny}, shy, from minor religion, from a different \textbf{race}... They prey on people they consider "weak". So when a man hits his wife as regularly as we can define as domestic violence, he does not do that because he thinks "we are equal, she can handle it", all he thinks is "She is MY wife and should do as I say, so I'm gonna show her who is boss". That is why we can find domestic violence from women towards their husbands and even in \textbf{homosexual} relationships (though those are not as \textbf{common}). It is not only a matter of \textbf{gender}, it is a matter of dominance, but our patriarchal society has been teaching men that they should try and be dominant. Thank God, \textbf{sexism} and other kinds of prejudice are being slowly erased from our society and more and more people are starting to realise that too. I hope I've made myself clear.

You're saying that men are pressured to be masculine. This is not true. "To push down fear, and pain"This is a survival instinct, established for protection during intercourse, but I'm sure that you know all about that one, huh? "To never cry, or be vulnerable"You're saying that men don't cry? what is this sophistry? honestly? I mean, show some respect for god's sake. Stop trying to change every single person into some Utopian fantasy land where they are all feminine. Yes, I agree that some men would love to show emotions, while the other men choose not to (without the pressure from society telling them to hide their emotions). It's a logical conclusion that most men come down to. It's a position where you're not continuously talking because you know that you could possibly offend someone else. It's better to be friends than enemies. There are also some women who also come down to that conclusion, so I'm not saying that it's just men, I should say that it's a masculine trait. Masculinity is not a crime. It's not some kind of social pressure, so stop saying that masculinity is caused by this imaginary being that you call society. "Pressure to be into sports, or to have manly hobbies"What? I honestly don't feel any kind of pressure from society to be into sports, I view sports as a strategy based design which have two main factors that go into playing which are: offense, and defense. So it's not because they're brutally fighting each other, it's because of the kind of intelligence it takes to turn a game into a chess match. Manly hobbies? I suppose that you're trying to figure out a way to say that being supportive of manly things is a bad thing. but go on..."To prove yourself using violence or manipulation to solve problems"This isn't just men. I CANT BELIEVE YOU, YOU FUCKING CUNT. It takes a lot for me to go off like that. I seriously am enraged, and that's not because I'm masculine. It's because right now I'm seeing the complete obliteration of cognitive reasoning in your brain. This isn't an issue that is caused because of pressures, or \textbf{sexual} nature. It's human. It's a human response. You can't get further from that. If you were to look at chimps, it's usually the mother that's more violent. "To prove your manhood by having lots of \textbf{sex}."Did someone cheat on you Laci? is that why you're so up in arms against masculinity? because through cognitive reasoning I can come to the conclusion that you've encountered a guy that caused you a lot of pain. I'm not going to go much further into the psychology of this, but if you keep on attacking someone because of their \textbf{gender}, because you were attacked by someone of that \textbf{gender}, then your arguments are unwarranted. There's no real pressure on men to have a lot of \textbf{sex}. Men just use that to give themselves a boost. I usually ignore that. There's more pressure on men to get a job than to have \textbf{sex}, and I don't think that you realize that yourself Laci. If you honestly claim that you're for equality, then show it. "\textbf{Sex} objects"Then stop treating men as wallet objects."To make harmless jabs at each other,"Yeah, they are harmless, and they don't establish a dominance. getting emotional over something that someone else said is quite literally retarded. It's only something that someone with an IQ lower that about 80 would go for. I mean, honestly? what's the point in getting mad over something that someone else said. all that does is waste people's time, and diminish cognitive reasoning. "Pressure to be the protector in the relationship, never the protected,"Are you serious? Okay, but here's the thing, you're saying that the ones who are the protectors are wrong. It's called wording your arguments to where your view is highlighted as greater than another's. Creating a dichotomy between men and protectors is sophistry. A better argument is: Not all men should be the protectors in the relationship because not all men are the same. what you succeeded in doing there is creating a hateful argument towards masculinity. Saying that women should be the protectors, and that men should be the protected. It's not an argument where there's some kind of mysterious cloud overhead that interprets the argument how you want it to be interpreted as. but go on Laci, I'm listening."To be the breadwinner, the handyman, the money manager,"So you're saying that men shouldn't be those, and that they should be at home, raising the children instead of being those things? Again, this is an argument aimed at establishing a dominant role for women. This is a gesture to say that men shouldn't be the breadwinner, the handyman, or the money manager, because those are just social pressures. I mean, do you even listen to yourself talk? i guess that you do since you edited this video. "To pursue physically demanding, dangerous, and even violent jobs,"Okay, so here's the thing: men don't pursue those jobs. They fall into them. You're standing there, talking about economics on a video aimed towards promoting feminism. That's terribly (Situation) ironic if you ask me. I mean, you honestly think that there aren't women in those fields? My mother was the breadwinner, and she beat me as a kid, so there you have it, I was a kid that wasn't able to defend myself against someone who was 80 larger than me. Do you know that feeling? Do you know the helpless feeling of being trapped underneath a bed frame while your mother swung a plastic bat at you because it wouldn't leave marks, but it would psychologically change you? If you think you have problems, thank you for bringing them up, but here's something that I want you to ask yourself, "Was my dad an alcoholic?" or "Did my mother beat me as a child?" or "Was I raped by a neighbor boy?" before you talk to me about emotions. Of course, this is \textbf{nothing}, because it's just personal stuff. It holds no value in an argument, but since you love to bring in people that you know, then by all means, show me the people that you know, but don't expect it to hold weight in an argument. I've grown up in poverty, so don't be so fucking \textbf{blind} to the obvious truth. going on..."Pressure to be the leader, and to always have the answers,"Here's how this one goes, no one has all of the answers. There isn't a single person alive who knows everything there is to know about everything. So there's no real pressure there. I've seen women who pressure themselves more than men into leadership roles, IE hilary clinton, who is heavily pressured into that position by the radical left. These are not attributes of a \textbf{sex}, they are personality traits of individuals. So stop with the political agenda that would use violence, since the state is the legitimate institution that holds a monopoly on violence in a given area, to get your way. Isn't that something that men do? isn't that what you said? declaring it evil, even though you're intending to use the state as a tool to rule over men? This entire double think that feminists are spreading is entirely a disservice to humanity. You're already free, so why do you want to become warlords, and war mongers? because other feminists whispered something bad about you? "Oh let's get an emotional response out of her like we always do, that slut," these things are terrible words for intellectual reasoning and morality. "It's about shaming, belittling, and devaluing the feminine,"Because apparently you have to be able to complain about work instead of working. That's what you're saying. "Of course I don't like it, but I have to do it if I want to eat." If you understood that, then you would understand why people choose to hide their emotions, because if they were to get all emotional at the workplace, then there would be a tidal wave of irresponsible children starting riots in the factories to try and get their workplace better equipment so they don't have to worry about getting hurt. That's not where unions come from, but it's a part of it. (If you want to see what unions do, look at detroit)  \textbf{Sexism} against men is also about shaming, belittling, and devaluing the masculine, as you've done so far within the time allotted in this video, but go on and talk about how you're apparently being oppressed by some kind of male dominated institution that exists within reality, (Which institution is used wrong by feminists all the time because of some ignorance on the part of a well known proponent for feminism) I don't have too much time to spare, so I'm going to move on..."Notice how many of the pressures that boys face comes down to defining themselves as against women; I'm a man, because I'm not emotional, like women; I'm not physically small, like women; I know how to throw a ball, or even a punch, unlike women,"I'd like to see where you came up with this entire argument. this holds no grounds. Maybe in your hollywood movie screen, but I seriously doubt that this holds too much weight in an actual argument. I'm going to say this once, never do I compare myself to others, because I know what I want to learn, and I know what I want to do in life. Through philosophy is the only way to change the world. It doesn't change through violence, although the NAZI's pretty sure did like using a lot of violence to eradicate an entire system of beliefs in their country, they didn't eradicate individuals. Individuals are created when people are able to come down to a greater understanding of the world around them rather than spouting non-sense. "Pretending" to know what you're talking about is something that I've seen a lot of people try to do all of the time. "The expectation that they not be like girls,"I can talk in my head voice, but does that mean that I do? A lot of men talk in their head voices that make them sound girly, or have people question their sexuality, but if you're comfortable being the person that you want to be, then what is the point of the entire movement? Oh, yeah, that's right, to use an institution, that has a monopoly on violence, against men to prove a point. I'm trying to prove a point by dissecting  all of your arguments. I honestly can say that throughout this I have come to a clearer understanding on what the actual nature of feminism is. I've refuted ideas, and made a lot of them illegitimate, and I have so far won a lot of cases. There are no real expectations placed on human beings except for those placed on themselves. The expectations come from within the individual, not from outside. What you need to do, Laci, is take this from a 20 year \textbf{old} college student, learn how to argue. Stop regurgitating information that you found on some feminist sight, and figure out a way of not being a bigot."These \textbf{gender} specific pressures are a side effect of \textbf{sexism},"Just because you say that doesn't mean that it's true. "One way to be a man; one way that we impose on boys in a million subtle ways all throughout their lives, and the effects of that are serious, from men who have been taught to suppress their emotions for so long that they can't even physically cry anymore, to men who are left emotionally stunted in their relationships,"This isn't just men. You can't just say that this is ONLY men. This is how you are wording this. You stupid BIGOT. YOU'RE MAKING ME GO OUT OF MY WAY TO REFUTE THESE IDEAS, AND IT'S MAKING ME LOOK DOWN ON YOU IN A MILLION DIFFERENT WAYS. I CRITICIZE TO COME TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING, BUT WHEN YOU'RE SO FULL OF YOURSELF THAT YOU CAN'T SEE THE FLAWS IN YOUR ARGUMENTS THAT YOU SUDDENLY ARE A RELIGIOUS NUT JOB IN THE MOVEMENT THAT YOU'RE A PART OF. I have to get that out of my system from time to time because of how much bias you have in your videos. I mean, you serious can't make a coherent, cohesive argument, and you're not really making a case. These ideas that you're trying to get out, are based off of personal emotions, and personal bias against those that you are trying to make a case against. So honestly, you're just trying to start shit, you attention whore. "Caring fathers who can't get custody because 'nurturing' is a girl thing,"Wow, you actually brought it up in one of your videos. thank god, but do people really view nurturing as a girl thing? or is it because women make up false claims in order to get custody of the children, while white knights swoop in, and take the children away. The entire premise that you're basing this off of is quite literally one sided, and is again, bias. the logical fallacies that you are using to portray it being the feminine qualities that cause men to not get custody of their kids is completely a unilateral argument that doesn't take into consideration other aspects of the societal problems that humans face day to day. Your rant on gays:These are all ideas that are in your head."Dominance, power, and aggression"Necessary tools for survival, but bad for intellectual well being. Good for economy, bad for reputation. So, as you can possibly see the trend I'm making here. I don't believe that aggression is necessary in human interactions, but when you talk about the economy, risks should be taken. The natural order of a free market would naturally cause a risky action to either be rewarded, or the opposite, rather than being rewarded, or rewarded with tax money. but go on.The wrapping up of your video I agree with, but you seriously have to get a better grasp of your arguments. Laci, You have great ideas, but you shouldn't frame them as if it's one \textbf{sex} that is bad. Both are equally bad against each other. once you realize the instability that the movements of egalitarianism have when they're both opposing each other while trying to create equality for the sexes, then you can come to an understanding that it's much like a left vs. left feel to it. Of course, I'm a right winged anarchist, but here's the thing: I believe that everyone has the right to live their life equally. Everyone has the ability to create a world that they want to live in. If you want to stop having heated arguments, then you should start behaving that an adult instead of a child. Ghandi sat in front of tanks, and was shot, but he never used violence. That is where I am at. We should never use violence as a means to an end. we are humans. It means that we are meant to endure. We survive like all of the other animals in the world. I don't think that any kind of violence would solve any form of conflict because hatred begets more hatred. I never agreed to live in this world at this time, but I also enjoy the time that I'm having. I think that every single last person has the ability to do so. Stop asking for help. You're supposed to be able to help yourselves. Stop taking advantage of altruism, and just take care of other people by yourself. If you want to take care of other people, you should do it, and make it your choice to do so, but while you're doing it, do not feed off of the guilt of others, for doing so takes advantage of your fellow being\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Blind, Gender, Nothing, Old, Sex, Sexism, Sexual & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s, Age - Youngsters, Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}16/2719 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.588 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I'm really happy about this video.  I've respected your voice on \textbf{gender} equality for a long time, and I'm not surprised that you're talking about the \textbf{sexism} men face.It's great because this part of the issue is under-examined and under-discussed.  Because many of the iniquities women face are so egregious, even at times manifested as institutionalized violence, it's easy to ignore the \textbf{gender} bias put on men and the real damage it causes in society.Thank you for talking about this here.Could you maybe do a video about male reproductive rights?  You usually do pretty good research and I think that unlike a lot of so called "men's rights activists", you could actually get people discussing it and finding solutions.My view is this.  For most of human history, no reproductive rights for women.  That was abominable.  Lots of struggle and the latter half of the 20th century later and women have reliable birth control that is entirely within their control and covered by insurance, legal protection for their right to terminate pregnancy, and multiple options for giving a child up to the care of others if they choose to see the pregnancy to term, but aren't ready for motherhood.  Men....not so much.  Condoms sure...but not as reliable...and I've encountered at least as many women who hate them as men.  Abortion...well there's no way to give a man choice in that situation without grossly violating the \textbf{woman}'s rights, so I don't see a solution there.  Walking away...this is the solvable legal issue.  Under the law, a \textbf{woman} never has to become a mother.  It doesn't matter what the context was for her pregnancy, she can give the child up.  In my state, she can flat out abandon the child at any hospital within the first week after giving birth, without legal repercussions.  I'm not saying that there isn't a real emotional cost to a \textbf{woman}'s options, but the options actually exist.  A \textbf{woman}'s choices regarding when she wants to become a mother are legally (if not socially) entirely within her control and completely unconnected to her \textbf{sexual} choices.  Men don't have the legal option to walk away.  Their choices are become a father, pay child support, or hide.I think both men and women should explore their sexuality freely and responsibly.  They should use the available forms of protection and get tested.  They should have mature conversations with perspective partners, so that they understand and accept the histories and current status of whoever they sleep with.  That's my opinion...my "what I think people should do".  The law is something different.  The law is \textbf{blind} to a \textbf{woman}'s behavior.  She could meet my suggestion above, or she could have completely unprotected \textbf{sex} with dozens of men every week.  Under the law she has the right to determine her reproductive future regardless.  I think that is right.  In fact I think it needs to be strengthened, since there's obviously a lot of slut shaming and full on campaigns trying to take these protections away.  But, let's examine the legal status of male reproductive rights, or rather the lack thereof.  When a pregnancy occurs, the default for the man is financial responsibility.  If a child is going to be born, the man must go through a fairly lengthy legal process to avoid having to pay child support if he's not ready to be a father, or he has to disappear.  It doesn't matter if he even had \textbf{sex} with the \textbf{woman}.  There was a case in the Pacific Northwest, where a \textbf{woman} injected herself with her ex-husband's sperm against his objections.  When she conceived, she successfully sued him for child support.  If she had slept with an entire bar, and conceived, she would have had multiple options to walk away, but this man was legally bound to sperm he had frozen during their marriage, despite no longer being married and not having \textbf{sex} with her or giving his permission for her to use his sperm.  That's not equality is it?To provide context.  I'm married with a daughter, and my wife and I want to have at least one more child.  I'm someone who is really comfortable with and revels in non-traditional lifestyles, while actually wanting a fairly traditional life for myself.  I chose marriage and a child.  If I can ever make enough money that my wife doesn't have to work, then we'll do that, because that what she wants and I'm comfortable with that choice (though I'm comfortable with her working and respect her career, she's impressive at what she does).  Those are our choices.  I chose my life with her and role as a father, and I'd choose it again.  I...CHOSE.  I think all my fellow citizens regardless of the nature of their gametes should have the same choice.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Blind, Gender, Sex, Sexism, Sexual, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}11/801 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.373 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small This has to be one of my favourite videos to date. It touches on something important to me, and a very good friend of mine.He was sexually assaulted by a girl, who had cornered him when he was drunk at a party and dragged him to a bedroom despite his protests (of course no one helped him, because apparently, guys getting raped is 'funny'?). He managed to get away from her but not before she'd felt him up, stuck her tongue in his mouth, her hand down his pants.When he tried to talk about it, or find some help, there was no support. The fact that he was single, and she was attractive, somehow cancelled out this assault in people's minds. He was expected to have \textbf{sex} with her, because men are the fuckers, women are the fuckees. The fact he didn't want to didn't seem to matter. It was not his role in society to be the victim, which brings on a whole other type of victim shaming.Every time we break down one nonsensical social stereotype it benefits everyone. My friend should not have his masculinity, his self worth, and his safety dependant on his being willing to fuck everything in sight and be aggressive or dominating. He is a kind and loyal person, who's now found himself a steady girlfriend, but it's still sickening to know how far \textbf{sexism} affects everyone I care about.Everyone has a right to safety, and the right to choose how they measure their self worth.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Sex, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/256 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.781 \\  \hline

As a matter of fact, \textbf{lesbian} feminism, \textbf{gender} critical, and anti-porn feminists are often much more well informed than most liberal feminists that have occupied Tumblr and the such. Feminism is definitely a movement for empowering women as women are socially and historically subjugated. While some men identify as feminists, there are valid reasons why \textbf{gender} critical feminists exclude men and don't need allies, ofc. What sets my alarm off is that you attack the most positive comment in this thread while completely ignoring many other comments that are blatant lies.

What Laci is trying to show is that feminists care about men as well."Most of the words she said I actually agree with, and for the most part I think that she is moving the conversation forward for men, much further forward than it is in most of the culture.However, there are two things bug me about what she said.The first is that many of the words she said, are not backed up by actions be feminists. For example she said that among other things, men and women should be free to strong and protectors, or to be weak and protected.It is extremely rare for feminists to support any policy, that is targeted towards men, that protects and supports them when they are weak and need protection.For the most part, feminists claim an almost universal female monopoly on being weak and needing protection. I don't remember ever hearing of a feminist policy which covers an area where men need more protection than women.Such as being a victim of violence. If Laci's argument were backed up by feminist action, then feminists would be protesting the Violence Against Women's act, stating that men are more likely to be victims of violence than women are, and that men actually need more protection against violence than women do.This kind of thing is completely opposite to the way that most feminists actually see the world.Also Laci framed \textbf{sexism} men face, as some lesser side product of \textbf{sexism} that women face. Because the one thing that men can not be is women. But this ignores the biological fact that compared to women, men have virtuatually no reproductive value and virtually no \textbf{sexual} power. In terms of our biological programming, a man can't afford to need to protection a \textbf{woman} is granted, because it is essentially irrelevant if he disappears. An individual man has virtually no value in terms of making children. For the most part, he only has value if he brings value by DOING something valuable towards raising the children - offering protection, resources etc.In other words, biologically, as long as a \textbf{woman} can have children she fundamentally has value, a man only has value if he DOES something or CONTRIBUTES something in order to make up for his lack of value.Far from transcending this, feminism is neck deep in the biological programming it claims to transcend.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Sexism, Sexual, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}5/417 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.199 \\  \hline

However she drugs him tied him up wait until he wakes up then cuts on his penis sticks it in a blender and turns it on. If you reverse the roles in a man mutilated \textbf{woman} this way that man would have been killed in the streets undoubtedly by somebody. Yet because it was a man it was made a joke on national television not just by the view and those feminazis but by women in general. The rule of thumb should be if you switched roles and it doesn't make sense then it doesn't make sense. Men and women get together in Toronto in order to discuss issues that affect men. These were very pertinent and well deserving of discussion issues.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I've noticed this as well and it's always bugged me. This idea that boys and men can't be emotional, or nurturing, or physically smaller... that they have to have certain personalities and certain body types, in fear of being "\textbf{effeminate}" and therefore, "like girls and women". It's just ridiculous! Women do not have a default personality or body type, so why would men? We are all different, we each have our own mix of feminine and masculine traits (because we all have our own mix of estrogen and testosterone hormones), so \textbf{gender} stereotypes are not only ridiculous, they are also harmful.I had to watch my little brother grow up being called a "\textbf{pussy}" by his friends anytime he would get emotional and cry. Being called a "wimp" because he was smaller and weaker than the other boys. An idea that although my father never spoke aloud, was an attitude he upheld. And it greatly affected my brother's self worth... he began to BELIEVE those words, believe he was \textbf{nothing} but a weakling and a "girl" because he wasn't like the other boys. It was ridiculous and cruel. There is \textbf{nothing} wrong with being masculine, but there ARE different levels of masculinity. To drag people, boys and men, through the mud for not fitting a certain male stereotype is just as wrong as doing the same to women for not fitting female stereotypes.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Effeminate, Gender, Nothing, pussy & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Gender - General, Nationality - Chinese, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality & \cellcolor{green!27}5/233 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.146 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Well, I think you fail to see how nature has taken it's course. For an example, you say men are usually the protectors. Can you guess why? Nature (not society) has made men to be usually stronger than women. Nature has made men usually taller than women. You say it as if "society just hates for men to be feminine" and that isn't exactly true. Let's face it, I'm stronger and taller than you, therefore if someone had to fight or defend, it would be me. It makes logical sense for me to be the protector. Physically, I'm better capable for combat. Suck it up. Men and women are not the same. It's true. The same could be said for women that want to participate in combat in the military. I'm not stating my stance on that, but I will say that it's no one's fault that most average women can't do one fucking pull up. The requirements even reflect that. Sure, there's plenty of \textbf{obese} and overweight men that can't do them either, but the average man can probably do at least one or two. It's not men's fault, women's fault, or society's fault.

Well, not true, your case was the exact opposite, and neither she nor anyone should get away with murder because of a stereotype. But you can also see that this case is just one part of what happens in the legal system right? Real life example, a friend of mine was raped recently, they used a day rape drug on her, and when she managed to get to the hospital with her mum to get checked they didn't want to do the rape test on her "because she was a teenage mum and since she was not a virgin anymore, well what was the point?" so the legal system SAYS she should be treated medically but culturally my friend was ridiculed and embarrassed, after having been a victim to \textbf{sexual} assault nonetheless. So in some realms women have the upper hand and in some others we are very much screwed. I am really sorry for what happened to you, in was unjust. But mate we are on the same boat, \textbf{sexism} is crap BOTH WAYS  and I can say it confidently, no feminist rooted for the \textbf{woman} that attacked you, or for whoever laughed at you, any self respecting feminist should stand up by your side and say, "that is unacceptable".

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Laszlo Vajdawe have been having a nice chat, and I see you still talking about "men are better at stressful situations..." " women blame all their problems on men..." Dude, THAT is just not true, there are women that are extremely effective under pressure and men that make really bad decisions under pressure and the other way around too. Yes men went to the moon and Gandhi created peace, there is also bar fights and Wall Streets scandals. There are women that manage to be mums without loosing their minds and also women that do and kill their children. Both genders do it all and to box ourselves into this stereotypes is just not fair. Also, there are numerous feminist here that have patiently explained how we do not blame men for all the misery in the world.  Example ME: "After writing all this I also want to say that I don't mean that men are evil at all, but it is hard to convey tone in writing and I really hope it has not come across that way. There is no fault or merit on whatever \textbf{sex} you happen to be born in, its like \textbf{nationality}, I can see that it would be pretty annoying if I was a normal bloke hearing constantly that I was the cause of so much misery. I totally get that it is not ALL men that are misoginistic, I get it so much that i find it silly to say it out loud, it is sooo naturaly obvious, but maybe it should be said more, cuz it is stupid to allienate you guys from the cause of human rights and justice. I get that this is a system  we inherited as is, but we can put our humanity forward and accept that there are some injustices put upon us (both men and women) and that is the whole point, lets get rid of ALL the injustices. I dunno if I said it to you in this convo or another convo on this topic but I care more about our awareness and actions now and moving forward than to point blame. I am sorry if you feel that that is what feminist do all the time, and i can see how we might come across like that, but seriously man stay with me here, all we want is justice, not to screw guys over for historical injustices we know you didn't commit yourself.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@o O My guess is that feminist would say a \textbf{woman} should be able to be a \textbf{sex} worker if she decided this freely (which is the tricky part for most \textbf{sex} workers entered this business not as a first option, and the amount of addiction problems that \textbf{sex} workers suffer is very disproportionate suggesting that they seek coping mechanisms, I lived in Amsterdam and researched on this topic, not an easy one, I applaud Sweden's way to deal with the issue, I think they are onto something there) But that is my guess only. However, could it be that maybe the so called "feminists" that seek to attack men are more popular on media because of the impact factor, they attract more attention and might look numerous although they are not and are not necessarily the ones driving the movement? The extremes of paradigms get tons space in the media and more attention, it doesn't mean they are a majority and it doesnt mean that they ones that got us here. The Laci Green youtube channel is not really the place to find them, is it?

Yes, some men are TERRIBLE under pressure, some women are very good under pressure. This is obvious. And if I said women blame all their problems on men, I actually meant feminists, and by feminists I mean extreme feminists.The fact remains though, if a group of men on a talk show talked about how awesome it was that a cheating \textbf{woman} got stabbed in the vagina, the country would react totally differently than the view talking about how awesome it was that a guy got his dick chopped off for the same reason.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/119 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.84 \\  \hline

I feel like we go in circles when we are actually agree. The women you refer to (seeking revenge, wanting special privileges, laughing about the poor guy that was attacked)  are not feminists, they are called misadrists (if they stop wanting equal rights and carried on wanting more than men, they are no longer feminist and they really hurt the cause by making the mistake of identifying themselves as such, they are no longer feminist by definition even)  Also, my point also stands about generalizations man, it hurts us all in the long run, we need to be accurate when we speak because language also shapes our environment. Where you might hear an innocent remark such as "men handle stress better", lil boys get a sense of superiority that very well may be false, and lil girls hear that they are not as good as. this goes both ways, You see my point? this should be the rule of thumb\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/195 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.026 \\  \hline

And I disagree with this recent remark of a popular feminist you quoted. Why? because although it is true, in a relevant sense, that men have most of the power in societies, there are plenty of particular cases where that condition does not apply, and these particular cases are just as valuable, E.g. say an \textbf{elderly} man and his female carer who might abuse of him.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Tell you what.  All the ladies that WANT physically weak, emotional, "men" who share their feelings, cry, run from danger and talk at length about their insecurities, please go out and find them I assure you they are out there....  The video here is simply a collection of straw "man" arguments propped up to give the illusion that she knows what men face.  Not all men are "strong" and some of those who aren't probably don't like it.  Who seriously WANTS to be weak?  Some men aren't tall and don't like it, who WANTS to be short?  It has \textbf{nothing} to do with society pressuring me to be strong or tall, it's how I'm wired.  Not to hate being short or weak but to desire to be the best person I can be at everything I do.  There is \textbf{NOTHING} wrong with this.  Feminists take issue with men wanting to be men because it then imposes on them the need to explain why they DON'T want to be "women".  Now, I know I just became the target of every feminist's rage but fire away, I'm a man I CAN take it!  :)   Genetically, men and women are different.  I know that comes as a shocker for most feminists who think that the only difference is in our reproductive organs but it's true.  Mentally, men and women are different.  Denying it is to deny biology.  Perhaps THAT is the underlying problem here.  Many women have become convinced through modern feminism (which in no way reflects traditional 18th, 19th or early 20th century feminism by the way), that men and women are equal in every way.  IT'S A LIE!  Being equal doesn't mean that you will be equal in everything.  Psychology today has this to say about the male vs. female brain.Brain Function:Male "Male brains utilize nearly seven times more gray matter for activity".  They go on to explain that "Gray matter areas of the brain are localized. They are information- and action-processing centers in specific splotches in a specific area of the brain. This can translate to a kind of tunnel vision when they are doing something. Once they are deeply engaged in a task or game, they may not demonstrate much sensitivity to other people or their surroundings."  Ever noticed why some guys get so focused on a game that they tune everything else out?  That's the male brain in action.  It's linear like an ultrafast single core CPU, one task one core focused on the task at hand.  Ever noticed how guys when they are deep on a project HATE to get interrupted?  That's why.  The male brain IS different than the female brain. Female Brain:  "female brains utilize nearly ten times more white matter."  So how does this translate into action for the female brain?  "White matter is the networking grid that connects the brain's gray matter and other processing centers with one another. This profound brain-processing difference is probably one reason you may have noticed that girls tend to more quickly \textbf{transition} between tasks than boys do. The gray-white matter difference may explain why, in adulthood, females are great multi-taskers, while men excel in highly task-focused projects."As a guy I've been forced to adapt to dealing with interactions with women but I still hate it when we are discussing one topic and prior to that topic being brought to resolution the \textbf{woman} I'm talking with will jump topics to something completely unrelated.  Here's a great example.  In the course of writing this I've been interrupted 3 times by my wife to ask me questions that in no way are related to this topic.  Each time I have to disengage my brain from the topic and refocus to another topic.  For women, the \textbf{transition} is no problem.  For men, we generally HATE IT.  The more accustomed to being used in a linear way, the more the male brain hates being interrupted.  Look at history, who are the deep thinkers and changers of history?  Aristotle, Plato, Socrates, Newton, Edison, Nietzsche, Einstein, Gates, Jobs, Buffett, Carnegie, Andrew Smith, Franklin, Jefferson, Mason and on and on.  Some would argue that it's because men suppressed women and that was why.  However, even in the modern era men "deep thinkers" still outnumber women.  It's not sexist to say such a thing, it's fact and it's biology.  However, while women may not be the deep thinkers they are the quick witted thinkers.  Women are super fast with being able to look at unrelated items and form an image.  Makes them very INTUITIVE thinkers.  They can size up a situation quickly and make quick decisions.  That's a great skill if you are a trial lawyer or dealing with crisis management.  Ever wander why when there are multiple crisis going on in a house at once everyone runs to mom?  It's not because of some biology to just go to mom, it's because women can figure out quickly how to get the twins to soccer, when one has to go to dance while another has to be at karate and still pick up the dry cleaning while sewing a button on the dance outfit.  The brains ARE different. I'm sick of people trying to just kick people out of "\textbf{gender} roles" just because they suddenly think it's "sexist".  Our brains are different, our bodies are different, our genes are different.  It's almost like the male and female were created to complement one another perfectly.  That women would be able to fill in the missing pieces of men and vice versa.  Hmmm...  What a novel idea.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender, Nothing, Transition, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Gender - General, Sexual Identity - Transexuality & \cellcolor{green!27}6/932 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.644 \\  \hline

There are many things from evolution that can be polished. and hells yess! because it is indeed desirable that we take reign over many of our "evolutionary impulses" like power, control and dominance. Yes, maybe 5000 years ago a person with autism or a weak fellow would never stand a chance, but today we are in a time where that is not the case, THANKFULLY! We can build the society we want and a society that puts its agency behind \textbf{gender} justice is one I very much support. :)  PS Cooperation and charity are also evolutionary traits, and many other animals share them as well, to put it simply, humans would not have survived without those two either... cheers mate!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Fat, Gender, Sex & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical Features & \cellcolor{green!27}4/247 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.619 \\  \hline

Simple example: in some cultures u cant even propose or even think about dressing a baby boy in pink, that is insane, if you do you are kind of "progressive" or "\textbf{weird}" or "setting your kid up for failure at kinder".... the babies dont come with that in their make up, we put it there. so yes society (patriarchal or matriarchal) has a lot to do with this, but since most societies are run by men the generalization is that society is male driven. \textbf{Gender} roles are very current, maybe not immediately around you, but around the world, \textbf{gender} roles are well and alive, i am surprised that you would say there are no longer current 0.O I cant think of a day that I dont hear, things like "when are you going to have babies", or "so obviously you do the cooking at home" or "well if his job takes him there, you gotta follow"... and I live in a western society...  I can understand if you feel that this video puts all the blame in men behaivior, it certainly focuses on that, but to me what is important is to correct our perceptions (all of us, not just men) and allow people to experiment their \textbf{gender} in whatever way they feel fulfilled\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Fruit, Gender, Weird & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality & \cellcolor{green!27}6/258 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.326 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I've listened to a few ted talks in my life, I don't find them at all informative. The pay gap isn't true, a law was introduced in 1963 preventing wage discrimination against someone for \textbf{sex}, \textbf{race}, religion etc. The reason there is a difference is because it is on aggregate. Meaning it's an accumulation of all working men and working women. More men work than women, and more are in jobs such a CEO and managers, which bumps up the total significantly. In terms of any single \textbf{sex} being in more power than the other, here in Scotland a great deal of our province councils have female MPs as leaders. I would say it's very balanced. I don't speak for the rest of the world though, it may be different elsewhere. As far as I'm aware most developed countries have a mixed \textbf{sex} and mixed \textbf{race} political system, and if not it's not because women are being prevented from reaching these positions, because many have.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Race, Sex & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}5/165 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.03 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Dragon \textbf{Fruit}Did you see the Ted talk though? If you do, I would like to hear if there is anything saveable under your perspective. I think you have a point, yes, in part most men have better pay because thay have been doing it for longer, but this is just IN PART. Not the whole story, MOST countries in the world dont have this law, or have it but it is not enforced. Having a law is not the same as having the people backing it up. I In my country, for example, women have a hard time getting jobs when they are in "the right \textbf{age} for pregnancy" (the choice of no children is still very much taboo and thought of as a selfish unwomanly \textbf{woman}'s deed), most jobs dont give maternity leave (to either parent) even if, by law, that SHOULD be the case, and culturally it is \textbf{common} for the \textbf{woman} to stop working and support his man when they get married (mainly because if you where to choose one of the wages it would have to be his that is better...) Also note that this discriminate against men that feel the pressure of being bread winner and that perhaps would prefer a different arrangement. This and other discrimination practices also affect our overall wage compared to men, and not just wage (fot that is not the only measure of success) but simply our professional opportunities. But feminism is not a Scotland only movement (although great to hear things are better over there, btw I have visited Scotland and I really like it, i digress) it is a global movement, striving for \textbf{gender} justice everywhere. Great that the 1963 law passed in Scotland (hopefully all Commonwealth), that is a really good thing, but that is sooo far from the world's reality, only few women have been able to make it to political positions so far, that is a possibility now, in some places, and it is a sign of progress but certainly not the moment to say ALL is well now.

I think you might have a point, maybe an idea such as "privileges" is no longer accurate (but let us keep in mind that when feminists where fighting for the right to vote the idea of "getting a privilege"  was totally spot on, I am sure you agree) but today perhaps we need to move forward a bit and let go of what once was an accurate word, (because in that time getting those "privileges" meant just getting basic neutral justice) and maybe now there is more understanding and "privileges" is not exactly what we look for, but justice, equality, no discrimination, the idea of privileges might not be as spot on as it was. But man, know that it is a bit over the top to say that the whole ideology is broke (it wasn't broke when working class women literally chained themselves to factory doors demanding the privilege of equal pay) it is exaggerated to say  ALL of feminism is bullshitery, here is why, if you met and believed a group of self proclaimed "feminist" that wanted to chop your testicles well how about now you are meeting me, be fair and listen to the many more other "feminist" like me, right here and now telling you, dude "dont chop them, we don't want that, at all, at-all, we want rights (not privileges) just like everybody else.

Also this topic namely relates to an Americanized male and certainly does not speak for men all over the world. Tho the trend is to be macho in the first place. Not to be rude, but i doubt you're going to go out with some bitch dude that has allot of female characteristics. My point being, as men and women are both people, we both play our own roles and serve certain purposes. You can't be mad that there is not a complete equally of \textbf{gender} because you're important to play your own role in this world, even if you don't feel equal. I only see another human being when i look at someone else regardless of \textbf{gender}.

I can agree with you on how getting treated differently must be crap most of the time, but there are plenty of women that abuse special treatment and take advantage of it. This why we will never change, boys are taught be tough, emotionless and set in there ways. While girls are taught to be smart, emotionally stable, and responsible. A revolution is not sparked through just \textbf{gender} equality, but equality of all people. As \textbf{racism} still exist, and religious wars are still being fought.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Being intelligent is more in favor of masculinity than femininity. It's popular to believe men are smarter than women because most famous inventors seem to be men.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I wholeheartedly disagree. First of all, some of the greatest men in history were scientists (read "nerds"). Secondly, the most "feminine" things a \textbf{woman} can be are kind, sweet, loving, and nurturing; the most "masculine thing a man can be is a true gentleman. Why? because any man trying to be one will have to be able to defend himself and others in this world, and there is NO weakness in that. Being masculine is about being strong enough and brave enough to do what is difficult. Cheering for a football team \& getting drunk are not difficult things. Same goes for women who are brave enough to be kind, sweet, \& loving, rather than weakly falling into the status quo of modern feminism, which is "I'm a big bad b**ch, look at me everybody!".

In other words "if it affects men its not a problem we need to worry about because women have it worse". And I agree that women do have it worse.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small You're making an egregious error. You're confusing traditionalism with \textbf{sexism}. Traditionalism is what drives \textbf{gender} roles, not some inherent bias against one \textbf{sex} or the other.  It's traditionalism that says men are to work the plantation until they drop dead, or die in wars, while women stay back and are protected as much as society can because of scarce and valuable resource of the womb. Its not sexist, it was at one time simply pragmatic.The idea that men have had all the power throughout history is simply a lie.  A very, very, VERY tiny fraction of men have had power. A vast, vast majority have had far less power then women and were expected to die on the farm land or the battlefield to provide resources to children and to the state.It is not equality feminism seeks, but this power of the elite. To break the glass ceiling and grab the goodies at the top. While at the same time they stand on and ignore the glass floor beneath them.  Totally ignoring the billions of men slaving away at dirty, hard, soul-quenching and dangerous jobs so they (and all of society) can have ..well anything.  They cry "\textbf{sexism}" while fully supporting both traditionalism and elitism.  Instead of trying to make a more equal society top to bottom, they just want to join the elite.When feminists complain with equal fervor about the number of female trash collectors that they do about the number of female CEO's, only then I'll believe it's about equality and not power.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender, Sex, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}4/258 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.55 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@SemiLesbo It depends on how you choose to look at it, you're own personal experiences with it, and what is said in your circles. But just like any label, you can't call ALL feminist "selfish women who all out for themselves," because that's just not true. Are there a lot of females who DO do that? Oh yeah tons.... but it doesn't mean the term should be changed from it's original origin. It's people trying to explain what feminism truly is, and how it is meant to help all sexes, that is going to help reclaim the power of the term.The main reason it's called feminism is because the word FEMININE is being used to describe it..... which lets be honest, is the reason people don't like it. Because people still don't seem to understand what feminine really means. They still see feminism, and they automatically think of \textbf{woman}. That leads to, "ugh, \textbf{woman} and they're stupid problems.".. which is so far away from what it actually is. What I think true feminists want to see change.... is to one day, see people use the word feminism correctly, without discomfort, hate or irritation. Because it isn't a bad word. Being feminine or using the word feminine isn't bad. It should be encouraged. It should be something everyone should be allowed to feel AS WELL AS masculinity. Trust me, i've been with you in the past that... "hey, maybe we should just change the term so more people are open to it." But the more I think about it, the more important it seems to not only keep the term, but understand why it's important to use. Feminism isn't a \textbf{woman}'s movement.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Adrianna Rose My apologies if I misunderstood your personal stance. It seemed as if you were (trying to make that point) when you said "The point being made was.... many people look down on men for being feminine, and girls are looked down on for not embracing their feminine qualities. THAT needs to stop. Period. There's no deeper meaning than that." This kind of line echoes through feminist discussions, often in lockstep with attacking traditionalism. I defend traditionalism, because it is NOT defined (to me) by demeaning, sexist, obnoxious behavior. To me, traditionalism is the old-fashioned happy family, with a wife and mother who is beloved and cherished by her husband and her children, a hard-working husband who provides for and protects his family, and children who grow up knowing how to behave respectfully and kindly to everyone. I have always wanted that kind of life, but nowadays it seems that this modern incarnation of feminism wants to make that impossible by telling men that it's evil to want that, and telling women that any man who would want that is actually a rapist, a bully, and someone to be avoided at all costs. I am not a bully, nor a rapist, but I am doomed to be treated as if I were. That's what I mean about it being equally wrong to discourage people who want to fill traditional roles. I believe there are women out there who would love to have that life as well, but as long as they are fed the feminist party-line, they will never even consider trying it. They are often shamed by their friends if they ever let it slip that they think it would be nice to live that way. I will never have the life I want precisely because everyone wants to THINK that "people like me" don't want others to have the life they want. If I value a \textbf{woman} with feminine qualities, somehow that means that I hate women who don't exhibit such qualities. If I choose to pride myself on my masculinity, somehow that means I hate men who aren't so masculine. Feminism itself is trying to do to people like me exactly what it accuses us of doing to others, regardless of the fact that I don't. I realize that there have always been men who abused their stations in life, and that many of them were powerful men - but I am not them. I don't think it's right that all traditionalist men should be seen as monsters. Most were not.

I think if someone like you, who knows what they want, and allows others to choose whatever lifestyle they want, and you're not guilting other people into living your lifestyle, then theres \textbf{nothing} wrong with it.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@OnTheOutside LookingIn But feminists don't look down on masculinity… \textbf{sexism} looks at these general traits, but it is not specifically about having one of these traits. Let me spell it out, plain and simple to avoid rambling and being confusing:"Dude, what the fuck? That's so girly!""Or why did you cut your hair short? You look like a guy…""You can't do that, only girls play with dolls""Girls can't play football; it's a man's sport!""Man-up; men don't cry.""You should really wear make-up — it's what girls do, after all"And so on, and so forth — and, of course, none are exactly "feel good" accusations; all of them are things I've either heard said to men/boys in my life, or (on some of the ones directed towards girls) have been said to me.\textbf{Sexism} is, in layman's terms (and this is incredibly oversimplified) to use somebody's \textbf{gender} as a means to control them, to say what they can or can't do, and to define them. Therefore using the traits of the opposite \textbf{gender} to apply  to somebody is (to most people) viewed as insulting. The point Laci's trying to come to here is that it shouldn't be insulting — if a dude wants to wear a skirt, then that's \textbf{nobody} else's business. If a \textbf{chick} wants to strut around with a shaved head, that's \textbf{nobody} else's business. If a guy is upset and wants to bawl his eyes out to feel better, he shouldn't be insulted and hated on for being "weak" or "girly", and if a girl wants to take charge of a situation then she shouldn't be insulted and hated on for being "bossy" when she's doing the exact same thing as a male would in her position.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Chick, Gender, Nobody, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}7/294 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.381 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small And, having actually read through it all now (and seen that my point was made, wups), I want to say that it's never too late! I've heard of 60 year olds getting married and living the rest of their lives happily! I also want to say that the reason there's a lot of negative connotation around the traditionalist household is because historically it's kind of the cause of the first feminist movement. If you look back at Victorian England, for example, the \textbf{woman}'s job was to take care of the husband and kids. She wasn't allowed to vote and, when she got married, she stopped existing as an independent person.That's right. Under law, wives were an extension of their husbands. Legally and in any other official way, at least. They lost all right to their personal property (it became her husband's, because after all "she is just another part of him!", and he could do anything with it at any time without permission), they never had the right to vote, and if a \textbf{woman} tried to go up on the stand in court against her husband for rape, assault, abuse, whatever, she'd be a laughing stock — he could do whatever he wants to her because, legally, she was his "thing". It wasn't "rape" because it was his "God-given right as a husband" to have \textbf{sex} with his wife, whether she wanted it or not. But GODS FORBID any man did anything with another man… but that's an entirely different issue.History lesson over, in present day society (because of what the traditional feminist movement did) I think the traditional household is totally awesome!

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@fnog9 That's a very true statement, "notice how a lot of issues boys face are about defining themselves against women."... when she's saying that, she is referring to how boys are looked down on for having traits that are known for being "womanly traits". Things like being emotional, for crying, or being sensitive. Guys will say things to their friends like, "quit being a girl and stop crying. Be a man," which is completely wrong to say to ANYONE. She is trying to encourage men to be and feel what they want, without being persecuted, or called "less of a man" because he feels deep emotions. Because men and women should be allowed to feel the same exact emotions.The question we're left with is, what is wrong with a man being feminine or having feminine traits? And why are men allowed to bash other men for having feminine traits? This, in my theory, is not because men hate women.... but because they want a straight line separated down the middle.... you are MAN, you are \textbf{WOMAN}. STAY.... which is wrong to do. Many hate crimes and insane violent acts have happened in accordance with this theory that "a man should be a man, not a \textbf{woman}." The reason this can be construed as "hate for women" is because, women throughout history have been seen as the "weaker \textbf{sex}", therefore if you are a man lowering yourself to the standards of a \textbf{woman}, it's seen as weak and disgusting and "anti-man"..... which, sadly has resulted in more hate crimes, violence and murders. All this was born from the idea that many (not all) people still have today... that women are weaker, and men should not act like women. The point that Laci is trying to make, is that we are all equal.... free to feel all emotions. Men and women a like should feel OK to express feminine type qualities. And \textbf{nobody} should be bashing anyone for having feminine qualities because...... what is so wrong with being feminine? Where you get that she is JUST talking about women in this video is beyond me. It makes me think that you didn't even bother to watch the whole thing. The video is labeled "Does \textbf{Sexism} Hurt Men?".... and it absolutely DOES hurt men. The video is pretty much ABOUT men and supporting them... so..... maybe think about re-watching.It's the "hatred of the feminine, where it's come from, and why"... that she is focusing on. Not "All men hate women". She's not addressing all men. But she is aware of the history of how society raises boys, and says "this is the kind of thing that should stop, because Hey! Boys are welcome to express themselves in the same way that we do if they want to!".... show me where she says the statement "ALL MEN HATE WOMEN" blatantly, and i'd be on your side COMPLETELY. But nowhere, not this video or any of her other videos that I've seen, has she ever stated the hatred ALL men have for women.Are there men that do hate women?..absolutely. Are there women that hate men?..absolutely. She's coming from the standpoint of understanding why that is, where it's come from, who's been affected by it and what things we can do to help change that. If just TALKING about the obvious of what people have done in the past, somehow makes you think she's a man hater...... there's no hope in talking to you.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Really? "Hate crimes"? Tell me, if one masculine male hits another masculine male on the head with a baseball bat, how is that less of a crime than if he hits an \textbf{effeminate} male on the head with that same baseball bat? Secondly, how is it "\textbf{Sexism}" to despise the feminine, but NOT \textbf{sexism} to despise the masculine? Thirdly: Why is it sexist to hate those who don't fit traditional \textbf{gender} roles, but o.k. to hate those who do? While we're at it, is it o.k. to discriminate against white people? Christians? Who set these rules anyway? By the way; Laci DOES call out "The \textbf{Patriarchy}" in many of her rants, implying that all the hate in the world comes from some secret all male power that controls everything. That's typical man-hating feminist rhetoric, implying that all men are in on it. They also like to use phrases like "Check your privilege", implying that all men are "privileged", which is complete B.S. - MOST men are NOT privileged. They work hard their entire lives only to die penniless. They suffer at the hands of governments, and even have laws passed SPECIFICALLY against them, and are shamed for even daring to have a \textbf{sex} drive, one of the most basic requirements for the survival of the human species. You sound like someone who has a few brain cells, so do yourself a favor: Try looking into the life of an average heterosexual male, and tell me where YOU find the "privilege" in it. I've been one for 42 years, and in that time I've had everything I worked for taken from me, not because I committed some crime, but because I am a man who society says doesn't deserve any protection under the law. It was given to my former wife on the grounds that she is a \textbf{woman}. The fact that she violated the sanctity of our marriage by sleeping around had exactly 0 bearing on it. She was even permitted to decide exactly how often and when I would be allowed to see my son. Privilege? Where? What Privilege? Whiterex said ""Did you imply at one point that \textbf{sexism} is when one ONLY degrades the feminine? So, "\textbf{sexism}" is only possible against women? Oh, the irony.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@fnog9 Haha no, I did not say YOU hated anyone at all. I kept who I was addressing the "hate topic" to very open, because it's not angled towards any one person in particular. What I was speaking of, none of it, is a personal attack on you. I don't know you or what you're part is in any of the stuff I was talking about. So none of it was addressed at you, unless I said YOU very specifically. The hatred topic was brought up in a "historical fact" kind of way... not directed at you or any one person.Secondly, are you referring to violence against trans-genders? Because that's what you linked too.Here, I am not only addressing what Laci has said or you have said. I am also including my own thoughts into the topic. So no, I am not just replying to Laci's comments or yours. I'm explaining to you something that, I see you've greatly misinterpreted in her video.... and I was attempting to clear some of it up for you with more information. The "feminine" and "women" topic I brought up was my own thought, not Laci's.Also, never once did I say in my statement that there is a WIDESPREAD hate of women. Not once. Because I don't believe there is. \textbf{Nothing} in what I said would mean that either. You may want to re-read. She DID say in the video that women can be victims. She also went on to say that Men are victims of the same things as well. Literally, she said that right after the comment you chose to pick out. If you keep watching, you'd hear that. Again... WATCH the video. None of what she said ONLY focused on women, so I don't know where you're getting that at all or why you keep bringing it up as if that's something anyone is arguing. She literally said men are victims as well. Please, I think you really need to re-watch the video. And LISTEN.It almost seems like people in these forums just start getting ticked off by buzz-words, and then start putting ideas into the speakers mouths based on those buzz words... All the sudden, people start turning her/them into the completely opposite of who they are, and where they are coming from. Honestly, I think what we have here is a bunch of people who just don't like Laci, therefore they're not even going to really listen to what she's saying. They'll just wait for buzz words and attack. If you've quoted her, it's out of context and incomplete.  Because literally, the arguments you're bringing up make no sense, and have no context in the video that she made. Trust me, if you were right...

Let's just hope that she sees this as well and acknowledges this soon. I doubt she's as close-minded as you think.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@OnTheOutside LookingIn Sorry, I didn't see your reply, but I'd LOVE to address everything you said:First of all, in your reference to a masculine man hitting another masculine man, vs. a masculine man hitting an \textbf{effeminate} man... no difference whatsoever. Equally as wrong. I'm not sure what I would have said to make you think that I would think otherwise. But both are crimes, totally. Just because I focused on people dying as a result of "being feminine" doesn't mean I turn a \textbf{blind} eye to other crimes as well. Both horrible. 2. The reason why the majority of people see that \textbf{sexism} despised the feminine more than the masculine... is because... well, when is the last time you saw a man being bashed for being masculine in the same way men are bashed for being feminine? If you look at society, it's actually quite the opposite. The more masculine a man is, the more praise he seems to get for it. (Not that there's anything wrong with that of course) But I can't personally think of one example where a man get's bashed for being too masculine.... Not saying that it has never happened, but definitely not in the same way that men are shamed for being feminine. I'm sure, if that was the case, and being masculine was just as prominent of an issue in society as being feminine, it would definitely be talked about. But I can't think of the last time a man got killed for being too masculine. You can stereotype the word "masculine", and put it on people who don't agree, or are not comfortable with it, and that I can see as sexist. \textbf{Sexism} can be an issue for both.... I just see the direction it has on feminine and much bigger, and scarier problem BECAUSE of what it has produced in our society. 3. I personally have NO ISSUE WITH PEOPLE WHO LOVE TRADITIONALISM. If any "said feminist" says there is something wrong with wanting to stick to tradition, they are so VERY wrong. The only stance I have on it is..... stick to traditionalism if you so please. Just don't expect everyone to be that too, because YOU think it's right. It's right for you, and that's wonderful. But I have known many traditionalist that have a billion and a half statistics and reasons for why EVERYONE should be a traditionalist, and if they're not they're bad people. It's just as bad for anyone to tell a traditionalist that they're wrong for wanting a more \textbf{old} fashioned idea. This is just as bad as forcing you're religion on someone. I'm sorry that people have made that claim that if you want a traditional family, you're evil. I am definitely not one of those people, and I think that is so very wrong to say to anyone.4. The reason that I just don't buy into the idea that Laci is a man hater, is because she has many men in her life.. that she loves, and speaks of all the time. In not just this video, but in a bunch of others as well. However, I do think she speaks in generals a lot which I think can make her very easily misunderstood. 5. VERY IMPORTANT. However again... I do not believe that men are more privileged at all. I think that phrase is a little "\textbf{old} fashioned" in this day and \textbf{age}. It might have been back in the day, but it certainly isn't a problem now. At leased not as much. So I totally agree with you. I just had a chat with my boyfriend this week about how he just saw two women promoted in his company, above two other men who are TOTALLY better for the job and have way more experience and have worked for the company longer..... and these women got hired because, according to the boss... they're hot. (which you can argue, is sexist) And one is married to someone in the department. TOTALLY unfair, and in no way promotes this idea that men have more privileges than women. If anything, I think over time the feminist movement has changed things in order that now, more than ever, women DO have just as much opportunity as men do. Do I think that this can still happen and that they're are some places that still make a point to pay women less? Sure. But there are just as many places that are unfair to men too. So again, you won't be getting that argument from me, because I agree with you.In closing, I'm so sorry that things that have happened in your life have treated you the way they did. You're 100 correct, things need to change, and both sexes need to be treated equally. This means, men need to be given privileges that women already have as well.  We need to stop looking into our pasts, and starting looking towards the future, and studying our present. To answer your final question, no I don't necessarily think that \textbf{sexism} only applies to the feminine.... however, like i said before, I don't see men being bashed for being masculine. Which is why I think one is discussed more than the other. However, i'd love to have a discussion with someone about how men are persecuted for being too masculine, if this really should be looked at equally.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Blind, Effeminate, Old, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality & \cellcolor{green!5}8/903 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.886 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@fnog9 First of all, I have no interest in lying to you. I don't understand what the point would be, or where we'd go in this conversation if I was just spewing out false information. So if I say it, I mean it. Doubting my explanation is just further proof to me that I'm probably wasting my time, because you already have your own truth in your head. To address your statement:Laci herself, did not differentiate between "being looked down on as feminine vs being a \textbf{woman}".... I DID. Because it's just the truth. I was making that explanation to show you HOW she was meaning the statement... because she also did not, anywhere in the video... explain that \textbf{sexism} only hurts women. Quite the opposite actually. And food for thought:Why would she think that \textbf{sexism} only hurts women, and then go on to make a video about MEN and what they go through? One word is a noun. The other is an adjective. Clearly, by definition, feminine and women are defined as too different things. Also, in saying that \textbf{sexism} is against women, IS a part of the issue. That is truth. But nowhere in the video did she say that it ONLY affects women. Her exact words are "It's about shaming, belittling, and de-valuing the FEMININE." She goes on to explain that a lot of the pressures boys face comes down to defining themselves against women. That is true. Nowhere does she say that all men are against women. That's a completely different statement, and NOT what she said. She's basically saying that boys are raised to define themselves as the OPPOSITE of women, to NOT be women. And this is what she is saying is wrong and should change..... because ALL men and women should feel free to be as feminine or non-feminine as they want. The point is, boys shouldn't be told that they can't be feminine. People shouldn't raise their kids, or even tell others that if you man, you can't act like a "\textbf{woman}". YES THEY CAN. And the reason a lot of people say these things is because they personally believe, that is is a belittling act to see a man acting like "a \textbf{woman}" or having feminine traits. It's because, really \textbf{old} fashioned values have taught people that a \textbf{woman} is weaker. So "be a strong man! Don't be a weak \textbf{woman}!" is the message they're sending. THIS IS THE POINT OF THE VIDEO, AND LACI'S ENDING MESSAGE. The fact that men do still define themselves against "women" is not only true, but incredibly wrong. She is correct in that statement. And people need to understand quicker that if a man is more feminine, he's not being a \textbf{woman}. He just has feminine qualities, and that doesn't make him any lesser of a man.I still don't see how I'm wrong at all in my first statement, and re-reading my first explanation to you is STILL correct as well as my original comment. She uses the words "against women" to explain how a lot of men have been trained to think. They've been trained to be unlike women, the opposite of women, against women. You are only proving my point in that your are just waiting for "buzz words" and attack, before even understanding the context in how they're being used.I think at this point, I have overly explained and overly addressed what you wanted discussed.

I was called "\textbf{G\textbf{ay}}" for doing so (Though I never taught of that word as a negative, but they tried using it as an insult.. probably made them more mad that I didn't care)..The point is.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@th3n3wk1dd I understand what you're saying, and I think it's actually great that this kind of stuff didn't bother you or wasn't a big part of your life when you were a child. I'll say one thing though, and that is.... there are a lot of men and women that DO go through this stuff on the daily, and it HAS been a huge part of their lives, even if that doesn't include you personally. I think the movement is more for those people who need a voice, and for those who have been greatly affected by sexists acts. Because as much as feminism has helped change the way people see the world, there are still people out there that believe that "men should act like men" and "women should act like women". I definitely agree with you on the other point however, that the less certain things are talked about so loudly, the more of an action they become. I find that a lot of what feminist do is just talk, talk, talk... and don't DO enough. Which is why a lot of them are defined as "complain-y". People need to stop complaining so much about what they don't like, and start doing something about it.... without being angry. Anger has never solved anything.I do agree also that the word "feminism" has lost its popularity (if it ever had it), which.... I think is unfortunate, because they're are A LOT of great people out there who are feminists. They are people who love and want to bring goodness into the world by spreading the correct message of feminism. If anything, I think it's worth having a voice in feminism just to help support what they're trying to do... because it's what a lot of people want, whether they call themselves feminists or not. However, just because something isn't popular anymore... isn't a reason to drop it. There are a lot of things in this world that are "less popular" or "widely ignored". The crowd that follows "said thing", and how small or large it is.. doesn't take away the value of that "said thing". I'm with you. I personally haven't felt that I've been burnt too bad by \textbf{sexism} in my past. BUT I speak up... because I know it happens. It happens to my friends, my family, people I love.

BUT YOU SAID SHE DID!!!!  She didn't, and you're wrong for trying to say she did, and that she meant to, because she didn't.  She means exactly what she said.  Laci specifically makes her case that people are against the feminine, AND against women. 1:06  You can't even get off your high horse to admit the reality of what is being said.... by her, or yourself.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/180 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.556 \\  \hline

I will look at an issue and take a stance on it when I am well versed in whatever the issue is.I won't take a "feminist" stance nor will I take a "MRA" stance.. I will take my stance.You cannot do good if you say "Feminism" and people turn off.As a kid, I was lucky to have had great parents who are super conservative (stay at home mom - Dad work-a-holic) but at the same time loved us no matter what we chose to do and even had the sit down of asking if I really was \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} because I was so artsy fartsy.. and wanted to let me know that they loved me anyway.. So.. for that I am blessed.I just don't think feminists know what they mean when they say and "preach" things like the "\textbf{Patriarchy}" or "Teach Men Not To Rape" "Men need to stop abusing"... and how sexist those things are..

Plus, I can think of insults directed at women (bitch) and men (\textbf{pussy}) where the premise is that you are not being overly nice or overly tough. Plus, as an aside to everyone saying how feminism demonizes men, Malcolm X, probably the second most famous 1960s civil rights leader, said how \textbf{black} men should arm themselves and be prepared to kill white people and also said that white people were devils.

That's not true with feminism as you can clearly see who it favors and when you get videos like Laci's and Emma Watson... women are not the only ones being "oppressed"... so the name is a misnomer and because of that you get heforshe.org only asking men to not be violent but not women... and feminist.org naming their domestic violence page "911 for women"... and it's the very first page you pull up when you Google "Feminism" and not these "hole in the wall" websites that have like 3 followers and trying to prove that as a way of showing equality... That's the difference.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gay, Gender & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General, Sexual Identity - General, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality & \cellcolor{green!5}5/271 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.845 \\  \hline

Sometimes, however, it is a legitimate crticism of feminism.  And while you claim that Laci does not indict all men, her exact wording in this video is "there is one way to be a man".... referring to the way that society raises men.  That's completely false and presumptuous, and it would seem to oppose what you are saying.  Laci insists that men are raised to be one way, and in the same video is insisting that many of the pressures boys face is to be opposed to women, and against the feminine.  To me, there is only one other possible way to give a more inclusive indictment, and that is to outright come out and literally say, "all men are bad".  Of course she isn't going to do that, but the language she uses is as close and clear as one can possibly get to doing just that.  You are \textbf{blind} to the \textbf{sexism} in Laci Green and in feminism.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Blind, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}2/314 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.637 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@th3n3wk1dd\@Adrianna RoseAdrianna wrote in her first comment of the thread, "Feminine" is not defined as "women". Feminine describes a quality.. not a person. So when she says that "\textbf{sexism} is when one only degrades the feminine" it's meant to describe how people look down on "being feminine" not "being a \textbf{woman}" Those are two separate things.' I pointed out to Adrianna that this is incorrect.  Adrianna argues that Laci makes a differentiation between society looking down on feminine and women.  This is not true.  Laci says at around 1:06 '\textbf{sexism}… is about shaming, belittling, and DEVALUING THE FEMININE.  Notice how many of the pressures boys face come down to defining themselves against WOMEN.'  Laci does in fact, make the case that \textbf{sexism} is about looking down on being feminine, as well as women.  Rather than admit she mistaken in assuming that Laci made a differentiation between feminine and women, Adrianna went on a never ending rant about how what Laci said is correct.  So before I discuss whether or not Laci is correct, or presumptuous as hell in her words, I simply wanted an acknowledgment that Adrianna's initial argument was not in fact, what Laci was arguing.  Adrianna was arguing that Laci meant something she didn't. In a comment that was a response to me, Adrianna went on to talk about society's hatred of the feminine.  When I pointed out to her that I never used the word hatred in my comments, her response to me was that she has no idea who I am or what I am talking about.  So, I felt dissed, like I was talking to a robot or something.  Like how can you have a conversation with someone if you ignore what they say?  When I took the time to point out that she was mistaken, her response was to go off on a tangent and then tell me she doesn't know what I'm talking about. This might seem like a small thing to you…. but that's exactly why it bothers me so much.  Because before I even begin to discuss all the things, and larger contexts here, I feel that some people can't even admit the SLIGHTEST bit of error.  I find that incredibly weak and counterproductive.  I'm not even talking about error on the level of her feminist reasoning…. But to simply admit that her initial interpretation of Laci was incorrect. And then, I ask not for an admission of error, but simply to admit that she changed her tune within the discussion.  She could have done so without acknowledging that her original post is invalid because it is incorrect.  All I wanted was for her to admit that she changed her mind about the nature of her argument.  THAT'S ALL!!!!!  And she says she will not because for her to do that would mean that she would have to admit she was wrong about something.  HA!!!  How \textbf{lame} is that?  You will not admit any flaw at all, even when it's there to be seen, because you cannot stand the thought that you could be wrong in any way.  COME ON!!!!!!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Lame, Sexism, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}4/521 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.768 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The way I see it, dude, sexualization itself isn't a problem. :)  As \textbf{sexual} beings, we've got to admit that seeing the \textbf{sex} of our interest being portrayed in seductive, sexy manners IS pleasing. The issues, however, are that a) women are sexualized much much more than men and b) the majority of a vast proportion of societies perceive women adopting manners of dress that are portrayed as sexy as being less worthy of rights and respect afforded to women who 'cover up' and dress more conservatively.So I guess Ellen sexualizing men per se shouldn't be the problem. If she portrays them as less valuable or dignified simply because they're sexually attractive, though- then we have a problem. Does she? i ask because I haven't watched the show in a long while :)Catering to stereotypical ideals, on the hand, is never a good idea if you want to create a society where young boys and girls can simply be what they are rather than be told what they're told to be :/As for male circumcision, as a feminist, I can tell you very frankly that I'm outraged by it. There are many feminists I know who are too; who prefer to uphold the bodily autonomy of male children over the pathetic 'If it's religious, it's okay' excuse. It's an uphill battle denouncing this vile crime, though- much of the opposition I've met is from men themselves, circumcised and not :/\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Sex, Sexual & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/243 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.823 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Both arguments have validity here; I personally have seen those episodes of Ellen, and thought it was curiously hypocritical of her, or if not, it is an ironic commentary.

It often happens when the girls are almost teens, if not already pubescent, and may involve the removal of labia and the clitoris without pain relief or anaesthesia. It removes the majority of tissue that creates pleasure during \textbf{sex}. The clitoris contains as many nerve endings as the head of a penis, so a female circumcision could be comparable to being an 11 year \textbf{old} boy having the head of the penis slowly sliced off.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender, Old, Sex, Sexual, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}5/275 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.818 \\  \hline

So basically, you think it's o.k. for everyone to do whatever they want to, so long as it fits your idea of right. She blames \textbf{sexism} against males (which she defines as males who don't fit the traditional role, e.g. \textbf{effeminate} men) on what she sees as a patriarchal society (ruled by men, presumably of the masculine variety). So it's o.k. for men to be \textbf{effeminate}, but it's not o.k. for them to be masculine; EVEN IF THAT IS WHAT THEY WANT TO BE! Meanwhile, women will bear the blame for none of it, except for the weak-willed feminine women, who are merely enablers of the evil masculinity. They should all be strong masculine women.Understand this: Traditional roles have been around for so long because they work. Men know what is expected of them and so do women, and they all know what to expect of each other. Everyone doesn't fit those roles, but so what? Does that mean we throw the roles away and just let chaos reign? Let every child grow up not knowing what to expect of anyone? Do you really think that will make the world a better place?If you want to be whatever you want whenever you want and bear no guilt, then be it away from everyone else - because as a member of a society, WHAT YOU DO \& WHAT YOU DON"T DO AFFECTS OTHERS! How you act in public influences others; some it may anger, others it may inspire, but in the end, you change the lives of others merely by being around them. When you take up a cause without understanding it, you may end up changing the world in ways that will be a detriment to you down the road. Individuals are alone. Societies are not individuals, they are communities. Everyone in them is a part of something, not just a solo act. Yes, it CAN hurt to let people "be who they are" in a society. What if who they are is a rapist? or a murderer? or a thief? or a child molester? How would you like to have someone quote that phrase to you while you were being victimized?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small No, it's not about hating guys, so long as those guys are feminized. Men who do, of their own free will, fit the traditional male role, ARE targets, as are women who (also of their own free will) fit the traditional female role. The entire movement is based on the idea that traditional men are privileged and traditional women are victimized. It is, by design, a movement to put women in what feminists see as the traditionally male privileged role, while moving men to what they perceive as the "victim" role of traditional women. They celebrate women who act out masculine traits and men who display femininity, but they despise those who don't. As they perpetrate this myth, they avoid taking the responsibilities of the traditional male role, wanting only the privileges - and all the while shedding the responsibilities of the traditional female role, leaving those responsibilities squarely at the feet of men. If they get their way, they will be untouchable - no matter the crimes they commit, no matter the evil they do - and men will bear the burden of it all. It isn't about equality. Women already have every right men do and a few special privileges men don't. What it is about is taking everything and contributing \textbf{nothing}. If you are a feminist, tell me; Is it because you can't vote? or hold a public job? or get an education? What exactly do you think you have been deprived of? What is it that you think men have that you haven't taken from them yet? Wake up. It is YOU who is being naïve about feminism.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small This is not the reality of Feminism. This is just spin. In reality, Feminism is about belittling men; about destroying relationships. Many people, men AND women have had rewarding lives in traditional roles, but Feminists promote the idea that being a traditional mother \& housewife is weak, and that it's belittling to women. The "real men" you mock know that raising children \& keeping a home are things to be respected and honored. Feminists always point to rapists and abusers as if they were representative of all traditional men, but a real man would never behave that way towards ANY \textbf{woman}. How would you feel if you were always represented by the very worst examples of your \textbf{gender}? Men used to have honor and dignity, we were taught that we were to fight to PROTECT women (all of them, not just our wife or girlfriend), that we were to work hard to provide for our wives and our children, and that we were to love them like they were the greatest treasure we would ever know. Now we are mocked, ostracized, and hated for those values, thanks to modern Feminism. Meanwhile, women are taught to be hateful towards us, to belittle us, and to blame us for everything. Marriage is dying. Values are gone. There are very few households where children have both male and female influences anymore, and people are growing colder, more detached, and more self-absorbed every day. Way to go. By the way, for those who say Laci is defending men here, you're wrong; She is using examples of non-traditional men to show how all men with traditional values are pure evil and to be despised, and women with traditional values are just ruining life for feminists. Laci, if you truly believe you are right in your thinking, then I challenge you to show me the statistics that say life has gotten better for everyone with the rise of modern feminism.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small That is a very good question and I understand why it's confusing. Here's my overly simplified explanation. All human beings have traits that are masculine and feminine (or labeled so by society) Many men are not being allowed to embrace their "feminine side" of themselves because it's is considered "weak". Women are deemed as "weak" because they are suppose to not have any "masculine" traits and be all "feminine". This brings out all sorts of \textbf{gender} inequality and hatred on both sexes, LGTB and transgenders alike. The Feminist movement is about allowing both sexes to embrace the fact that it is not weak to be "feminine" and that it's ok for us to be human of both traits. This means we should be embracing equality for both genders so we can experience being human in all it's traits without judgment. Idealistic, I know, but it's worth striving for and improving our humanity in the right direction (or a least a solid step in it). He4She is a movement that invites men to do just that.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/175 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.571 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Of course feminism is specifically for women, but not exclusively for women. Feminism is about addressing the power dynamics of \textbf{gender}, in which women typically are deprived of power and men typically have excessive power. Therefore \textbf{sexism} affects women and men both, as oppressed and oppressor. The two go together: you can't have one group from whom power is removed without having another group to whom power is given. This system of unequal power distorts and damages relationships between all men and women. By focusing on women, feminism naturally also affects men. In short, by redressing the imbalance of power, feminism achieves the goal of equality for all.This also explains why egalitarianism combined with antifeminism is wrong: it refuses to recognize that the power dynamics of \textbf{gender} harm women first and most directly. This kind of egalitarianism is like the advocates of \textbf{Jim C\textbf{row}} who claimed to support the idea of "separate but equal" for the races. We now all know this was a lie. These people did not support equality; they were just rationalizing inequality.

I have directly spoken to girls who told me that the only reason they wouldn't consider was because of my height, which is personally frustrating.

Don't take me wrong, I like to see my man cry, be hurt and show it, I don't want a cold stone, but I will not be in a relationship with someone who cries more than I do. I don't think men and women should be equal in some things, because we weren't created equal nor were we created to complete the same roles and I think our inequality is beautiful, it's what makes me a \textbf{woman} and him a man. Yes, I can do majority of things he can, not everything and that's okay, but sometimes it's nice to have a feeling of being protected, of feeling safe in your man's arms, for him to be strong, it's not \textbf{sexism}, it's the way we were made and stop trying to twist it around. Nature is 'sexist'.then. We should teach our boys to fulfill their masculine roles, not terrorize them, but encourage it, it is in their genes, just like in mine is to be more tender, have softer skin, higher voice, be more nurturing. Call me sexist, I call it nature. If I have a baby boy one day, from me he'll learn that it's okay to cry, it's okay to be vulnerable, to need protection, and that \textbf{woman}'s hug can offer comfort, but from his dad he'll learn to be strong, to take care of his \textbf{woman} when she needs him to, to provide for his family and protect it, and from both of us he'll learn what it means to be a real man, both strong and vulnerable, ready to face a world that can be a cruel place.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Sexism, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/330 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.909 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small That's feminism for ya. Hilarious in their lack of understanding of their double standards:When a man showing traditionally feminine traits is hated on, the feminist understaning of such a situation is that it's based on loathing of female traits. That traditionally feminine traits are considered less than masculine. \textbf{Misogyny} is the answer (let me hear you say it.. OOOOFFF COOOOUURSE!)At the same time a \textbf{woman} hated on for showing traditionally masculine traits, is a victim of \textbf{misogyny} and a narrow understanding of what she's supposed to be. It's all about people being mean to her. ...but it's not an example of masculine traits being seen as less or bad. Eventhough the exact same thing is going on!?The double standard, the proof of how little these ideas are thought through before served to an eager feminist audience, is so amazingly clear. I simply don't get why so many believe the hype and march on thinking they are in the right. If you have to set up different rules for the same behavior, based on whether it happens to a man or a \textbf{woman}, you should realize you're wrong. Logic dictates it.Traditionally a great part of dividing people into \textbf{gender} groups, have been based on that they are opposite to the other \textbf{gender}, and traditionally lots of backwards bigots have had a hard time accepting those who overstepped the invisible lines between the two genders, and allowed themselves to borrow from what was traditionally understood as belonning to the other \textbf{sex}. There's is \textbf{nothing} new in this, no revolutionary thoughts on my part. it's boring history, simple facts. Why Laci and feminists in generel thinks they can get away with making up different rules for when the same shit happens to two different sexes, is beyond me. it certainly goes against this whole equality idea they're pronmoting.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender, Misogyny, Nothing, Sex, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}8/309 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.589 \\  \hline

If you're watching children by yourself, both sexes are going to be looked at oddly. There's the whole trope of single women stealing children, remember. Although, women do get away with luring underage boys, because society teaches boys between 12-17 that when they have \textbf{sex}, they're lucky and in control (which is incredibly hurtful to male rape victims). This doesn't stem from feminism, this stems from \textbf{old} gender/societal norms. 4. I've seen surveys indicating more than half of women like facial hair. Look them up for yourself.

And even then, only tiny sub groups within feminism even deal with anything male related, like Laci only has a few of these male focused videos, and if you look at the major feminists, just how many even deal with male problems? I can't support something that doesn't support me, and more especially, I think it's blatantly being dishonest to say something is about both men's and women's rights when its actions clearly dictate otherwise. This is why I am an egalitarianism.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Melthornal I'm kind of at a loss for words here.. I'm not denying that some women do believe and say these things (as you obviously have experience). Unfortunately, sometimes I find myself thinking some of those exact things, but then I quickly remind myself that they are not true. They should not be universalized and they are destructive ideologies that have been ingrained in me since I was a little girl. "Don't go outside by yourself at night", "don't talk to strange men" (whatever that means), "don't dress in a way that will tempt a man into becoming a neanderthal". All of these things have taught me as a \textbf{woman}, to fear a MAN. I hate this so much! Though that's not to say that those kinds of men don't exist either. I think the issue is that we are so friggen bent on these stereotypes and labels to define who we are and who we should associate ourselves with. Not all men are rapists, and not all women think men are rapists. Do you ever speak up to these women? How about trying to inform them that their beliefs are harmful whilst also acknowledging that these fear-mongering discourses that ALL men are rapists is just a social construction and has no truth?

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Adrianna Rose You're trying to say not all feminists are like the bad ones, but from my experience and many others we know that most feminists are like the bad ones. They believe in false stats, they think there's a wage gap, they think there is a \textbf{patriarchy} that favors men over women and gives them an advantage. But if that were the case then why are 90 of the homeless men, why are women getting into college more than men, why do men commit suicide and are victims of homicide at a rate of 4 times greater than women? Women also spend 80 of all the disposable income in the US, so even if men are out working and making more they end up giving their money to women.Laci is not one of the good feminists at all. She made a video policing how everyone should be having \textbf{sex}. She specifically said each time a man has \textbf{sex} with a \textbf{woman} he needs to get a verbal enthusiastic yes from her, or else it's rape. She also said if a \textbf{woman} drank and her BAC is .08 or above and a man has \textbf{sex} with her, that is also rape, even if the man is also above .08. You can be held liable by law if you drive when you're above .08 and be responsible, so why can't you have \textbf{sex} above .08? \textbf{Black} out drunk is another story, because at that BAC level you wouldn't even be able to start the ignition and back out the driveway. Plus it's funny how she never brings up \textbf{sex} between two lesbians or two gays and if one of them is above .08 it's rape, she only applies that rule to straight men because feminism taught her to hate straight male behavior and protect \textbf{homosexual} behavior. She also doesn't apply that enthusiastic yes rule to two lesbians or two gays, she seriously has a problem with straight men and wants them to be thrown in jail for 15 years for bullshit reasons that she wouldn't apply to homosexuals.And when the Elliot Roger shooting happened she blamed his behavior on entitled masculinity, like there is no such thing as an entitled female. So just because there are a few good feminists that truly believe in equal rights and don't believe in all the bad propaganda feminists concocted about men, that doesn't negate that the majority still do. What if someone wanted to call themselves a \textbf{Nazi}, because some nazis were good and believed in equal rights?Men who are feminists are either \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} men who think feminism is going to make \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} marriage legal, or straight men that think by calling themselves a feminist it will make it easy for them to get laid.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@2Much4TheseBitches I really don't have anything to say about the first part. I don't have any stats. I just have my own beliefs on things, and don't compare myself to what other "feminists" have done. I'm not here saying that I have any thoughts on unfair wages... cause I don't. Or college, or homelessness or suicide or anything you mentioned. I'm not a \textbf{woman} screaming out that I think things are unfair for me.... cause I don't believe they are. So... address what I'm talking about.... not what some other person is arguing. Are you confusing me with someone else? Cause I didn't say any of that stuff. LIFE ISN'T UNFAIR FOR ME AS A \textbf{WOMAN}... got it? Let's move on.However... on your points for why Laci is a "bad feminist":1. Do you honestly think it IS ok for any two people to have \textbf{sex}, without someone giving consent first? If someone wants to have \textbf{sex} with another person... YES, you absolutely need consent first before you do it.. otherwise it IS rape. Are you having \textbf{sex} with people without them saying it's ok first? Because if you are... that is the DEFINITION of rape.. if you didn't know. So she is correct on saying that. The same would apply to a girl that has \textbf{sex} with a guy who didn't give her consent. It's all still rape. She is correct in her statement. 2. Having \textbf{sex} after drinking, still requires consent. She brings up this point because there ARE a lot of people out there that DO take advantage of people because they are drunk and cannot make clear choices. Straight, \textbf{G\textbf{ay}} or whatever you want to call it. All groups do it. If you're having \textbf{sex} with anyone... who did not give you consent first, it is rape. And it is easier to do if you've been drinking. She did not mean that if you have \textbf{sex} with someone who is drunk, it's rape. NO. I heard her video myself, so I know what you're referring to. It's about consent, and making sure to not take advantage of someone who is under the influence. She is correct in saying that.3. Never once have I gotten the impression that Laci hates men. She has a partner, who's a man.... she has \textbf{sex}. She TALKS about \textbf{sex}... with men. She has men in her family that she loves. She speaks up for both sexes when it comes to the issues of \textbf{sexism}, and how it should be defended... to help BOTH men and women. Where you get that she hates all men and wants them to be punished (or jailed in your case)... I have no idea.If you're referring to men that DO rape... meaning.... forcing someone to have \textbf{sex} with them, when the other party hasn't given consent...  SHE'S RIGHT! People that do that or have done that, SHOULD be punished, be that a man OR a \textbf{woman}! If you don't put yourself in that category, and your not guilty of ever being accused of putting someone in that position, congratulations... you have \textbf{NOTHING} to worry about. She isn't talking about you or to you, so why are you getting so upset by it? Unless you think rapists should go unpunished... I have no idea why it would be something you felt you needed to defend.If Laci wants to talk about her own experiences or others experiences with rape... or knows people that HAVE been raped, she SHOULD talk about it, and it should be discussed. Where you get that she is addressing ALL MEN as she talks about it... again.. NO idea how you'd get that idea. 4. She never brought up the fact that women can act entitled when talking about the subject of Elliot Roger because... why would she? When she's talking about him? That doesn't mean she doesn't believe that women don't do that. So calm down.5. The idea that you would compare Feminism to Nazi's.... is just... well ridiculous and a little over the top. Take a second and breathe. Plenty of women are on your side and don't hate you. It sounds like you're just really angry.6. Finally, your final thoughts on men that are feminist is probably the most closed minded thing you've said. I personally have many male friends who call themselves feminists who are not \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} (not all of them) and are not famous people.... They're normal, cool guy who just believe in the right to be who they want to be without the pressures of "male rules". So, sorry to burst your bubble on that one. It sounds like you need new friends. Or... maybe that's just what YOU would do to get laid. It doesn't speak for all males though. I sincerely hope you find some peace in understand what some people are trying to do, and it's not all about "women's rights" and "deserving something" and "i'm so victimized" blah blah blah. That's just noise. As long as there are people speaking up for the rights of both sexes, that noise won't win they're selfish and self centered ideas.

Any investigation and cross examinations and questioning the accuser is what feminists call "victim blaming" They want to give women legal power to imprison any man they want by pointing a finger and filing a police report. Real rapists should be punished, but you can still get consent without both participants verbally saying yes every step of the way, there's such thing as nonverbal consent.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Feminism is not about \textbf{gender}, so don't women-men me. \textbf{Gender} roles is the main source of \textbf{sexism}.1. Cis-hetero-men also have to be included in the solution to the problem. They are the main source of the problem - rape, \textbf{sexual} assault, murder.2. If you don't fight for the problem, you are part of the problem.3. There are also women, \textbf{g\textbf{ay}}, \textbf{transgender} people who are sexist. \textbf{Sexism} is a social problem, not a "man" problem. That's why it's not an excuse to be sexist because "women are also sexist". It's not because people are assholes that you too have to be one. Stop following the rules and stick up for what's right. Defending \textbf{sexism} is just like defending \textbf{racism}. It's \textbf{dumb}, and you'll look \textbf{dumb} in the future when you understand the problem. So stop defending yourself and start thinking about it. It's not your fault that you have sexist points of view. You've been raised in a sexist society, we all have. All the feminist had, and still have to study and understand what's going on. We've all been sexists, for we've all followed the rules. But if you put yourself in the shoes of those who suffer from \textbf{sexism} the most, women's shoes, you'll understand why feminism is so important for everyone, and why it's called feminism and not freedom. Everyone carries a burden, but they carry most of it. Don't use \textbf{sexism} as an excuse for \textbf{sexism}. Just because there's still people out there that didn't learn the truth that you can stay \textbf{dumb} and defend with them the indefensible idea that women should continue to be treated as worst than men.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I think that is a legit question and as a girl I too get annoyed when women shut men out. Don't get me wrong, I think there are a lot of politicians still stuck in the 20th century that act as if they know better about women's health, and they don't, and sadly they are mostly men. One could also argue that no one knows or understands anybody because they aren't everybody. These issues are true but it shouldn't mean we can't try to somewhat understand the facts about each other. Perhaps the reason why men don't experience \textbf{sexism} on a conscience level is because they are more privileged and praised then women, in many areas anyway, so less men consciously realize the \textbf{sexism} on their own \textbf{sex}. Why would you know something is wrong if society as a whole acts like it's right and normal? I personally don't see a whole lot of men loosing child custody either...but I know it happens and it's sad. I know a lot of men who had bad things happen to them and they rather express anger or bottle it up instead of allowing themselves to be vulnerable or even ask for help. Some solders told me once that one of the reasons why he loved being in the military was because you can express love for your fellow brothers (and/or sisters) and not be judged. One of the biggest reasons why solders go back to military life is because they want to be there for their boys. Not only that, but now women must treat every "cat call" and male encounter (esp after dark) as a potential rapist, which is not fair to men at all, but that's how we live. I don't like seeing this and I for one want to change it (or at least bring it one step closer to something better). I think we as a human \textbf{race} in the 21st century can do better and should demand better. Just my thought even though I have a vagina I also have a heart and mind like any other human being.

If every men I know is a pig, I would think that men shouldn't have the right to say shit about what I'm experiencing. The second point in that situation is that a lot of men try to say what women should do in their feminist movements, and say that they should do A or B and defend A or B (such as : why don't you defend men's right to custody?)That lead women to start denying men in the discussion.

You think men intrinsically hate women? How would that come about naturally?If you're against alimony (and likely child support), why are not actively pushing for equal wages  and paid wages during parental leave so that women don't have to be financially dependent on men? Chivalry, alimony... These stem for a system where women were not allowed to hold jobs, and where dating was inappropriate.

I was working towards a job as an engineer which would have meant even more money and gotten me off of the deck which can be extremely treacherous. I have seen 2 women on deck while working out there. one quit within the first week and the other was INDEED privileged and was kind of a buzzkill being that we always had to watch what we said.Got off topic there, but the reason I made so much is that I was in a dangerous field as a deckhad (an entry level position)  the \textbf{chick} I knew on the boat ended up being alright and at all a fan of feminism and we had the wage discussion. Low and behold we talk about our paychecks.... they are exactly the same.In an industry that you would think of as being VERY misogynistic she made the same as I as well as getting the engineering job that I'd been taking classes for.  (Didn't really have a problem with that) The reason I say we cant be fathers AND the boss is because we are constantly working. Trying to make better for our families, yes, hell I didn't even have time to spend my own money when I was out there. My lady did.That's not a bad thing, she works too.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Amadeus Diamond \@Adam Mantium Ok, maybe I know what you mean. It's true, there is some kind of renegation in part of cis-female feminists, that somewhat denies men in feminism. And I understand how harmful that can be.But I disagree from them, and I'm free to disagree. I consider myself feminist, and I don't negate nor deny men nor any \textbf{gender} in feminism. Feminism is not only the "fight" to defend women right,s in my point of view. Feminism is growing to become a fight against all "femine" repression, would that be homossexuality (that's considere feminine), bissexualisty, transgenders, and female rights. The rights of being feminine and femaleish are as juridically and socially denied as much as being a \textbf{woman}.But being a \textbf{woman} it's still SO MUCH WORST. How many men are raped compared to women? How much do we have to deal with \textbf{sexual} assaults, catcalling, being belittle for just being born with a vagina? This fight, against this problems, are from women, and they deny men, because men has always biased the fight towards THEIR rights and freedoms. I disagree that men cannot fight for feminism. I just agree with some of the feminist that most men (and women) are not qualified to embrace the fight, because of bias.The problem with this type of feminism is that they don't address the REAL issue, which is MEN being chauvinist; cis-hetero-men are the main rapist and the main harm to women. They HAVE to be inserted in the fight. And here I come again saying that there are several types of feminism, and they all, in general, fight against equal rights for everyone. My main theory is that most(missing data) women inserted in feminism sometimes make confusion between fighting for feminism and supporting sexist victims. I'm still unsure about this subject, and I really appreciate your critiques and commentaries, they are making me think. I hope I'm making you think as well.What I think that men should do is call themselves feminists, like I do, and ignore the fact the "women feminist" don't believe in men feminist; I am, I fight, and don't care what they think. They too afraid of having their main "enemy" (man, as said before, is the most proponent of sexist actions and the main cause of rape, and social sexist rules) inside the movement against freedom. They (who think like that) are wrong, and I am to prove them otherwise.You have to think that feminism is still growing and getting shape. It's not ONE SINGLE movement or theory, but a live political movement, with several branches (e.g. radfems, libfems) that have different proposal of solving the problem. I'm part of one that believe that feminism is not only about females, but the whole society.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@types10000 You are right and I did use some fallacies in that statement. I was angry. My point was to state that just because you have an opinion doesn't make you an expert, which was the persons' (I don't even know who anymore) statement. That person stated: "If there are men who disagree with the topic of mens issues(...)". Just because there are people who disagree with Climate Change (Global Warming) doesn't change the fact that the Climate is changing, or not changing. An opinion doesn't shape reality. To understand reality, you need to study, and not opinate.So, genetic predisposition, macro social and micro social environments play big roles on our behavior. There are evolutionary substrates, in some extent, to our sexist society, but it's by far distant from our social influences. Social rules are created by people, for people, and if you see throughout history, we have a lot of different approaches to ruling; there are indigenous societies that are matriarchal, for an example. So, our \textbf{sex} bias has some influence, but that doesn't justify sexist rules; social rules are created by dominant groups, and are made so dominant groups stay dominant. If ever, maybe female pregnancy could have influenced male dominance (females get vulnerable when pregnant, after all, and need social protection) which could have lead to a division between sexes, which by the end can result in a social inequality and therefore \textbf{patriarchy}. But that's not the end of every society and every form of civilization; we have seen throughout history several ways to solve social ruling (some of them survived more than others, you can agree on that).Those are the some of Evolutionary Psychology theories on the subject. What I studied in my thesis was different types of masculinity and of male expression, and how those men are. My conclusion is that there are several patterns of masculinity, and not only the dominant one ("The Father"), that play and serve different spots in society, even though the ~Dominant Male~ is the one that gets the spotlight because of \textbf{patriarchy}, and because \textbf{Patriarchy} is in check, this other ways of being "masculine" are getting more attention.My study was still small and not very deep, for at that point I had'nt still get in touch with the studies of \textbf{transgender} and \textbf{q\textbf{ueer}} and the feminist culture, so I would do it differently if I could.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Patriarchy, Queer, Sex, Transgender & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General, Sexual Identity - General, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality, Sexual Identity - Transexuality & \cellcolor{green!27}7/400 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.75 \\  \hline

Please, join the conversation- I welcome men to the conversation on feminism.  As long as it's a conversation- not a yelling match.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/251 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.398 \\  \hline

If you weren't aware there are plenty of Americans who voted for someone that wasn't Hillary Clinton– maybe due to misogny or preference in another candidate. Even if all feminists voted for Clinton, majority would still win, and if this majority is against her  prefer another candidate then there's \textbf{nothing} we can do. Most feminists are against certain \textbf{gender} roles, and that's what the focus would be on– to teach people that women can be politicians or run for president. (Also, if there was a \textbf{woman} and a man running for president, I would pick the candidate I thought best fit for the job. If it happens to be the man, then so be it. At that point it's not about \textbf{gender}, it's about who's going to lead the country.)Not sure I understand your next two paragraphs. Many feminists are against the labeling of "man's culture" and "women's culture" in the first place. You're mistaken. Masculinity isn't considered "toxic" in our view. What we think is toxic is \textbf{gender} roles that say "men must be masculine", which then leads to inequality for men who aren't considered masculine and ends up creating a mess when other men try to be masculine and can occasionally think that being masculine can mean treating people who are feminine unequal or disrespectfully. That's when we cross the line. You may be thinking about the \textbf{patriarchy}.When were feminists against transgenders? It's equality of the sexes.

But it's not how other parts of the civilized world work.And secondly if you say that "men having to be masculine" is toxic, then "women having to be feminine is toxic" aswell, which is all in all, a useless position to take.Because whatever \textbf{gender} traits you choose to adhere too, was \textbf{nothing} to do with how toxic you are.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender, Nothing, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/150 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.0 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Ok... Bare with the story-time here... So at the start of this video, Laci mentions men making jibes at each other to maintain social dominance. I have no doubt that this [Edit:] *CAN be the case. However, in Australia it is quite \textbf{common} to do this, but not to maintain dominance. The ability to be open and vulnerable to these jibes, and be able to accept and laugh about them with others is seen to be an admirable trait. Sure this can have negative implications, but for myself it has made me a stronger and more secure adult. I would argue that for a substantial number of Australians, this helps too.I also have a legitimate question I would like answered; preferably from someone working/studying in the field.\textbf{Gender}-roles can be sexist, but are not ALL necessarily sexist in nature. Is this a true statement? (Is it even a fair statement to assume?)As people, we have different intellects, different interests, different capabilities, as well as different genders and different sexualities (the latter two having no direct implication on the former). Some arguments I've read in this (massive) cluster of replies to the OP seem to be revolving around Feminism, and \textbf{gender} equality. Some of the arguments from both sides confuse the dickens outa me, and some (from both sides) just hurt my brain and make me angry....as individuals, is it not possible to not only accept that \textbf{gender} equality can only go so far because of the biological differences inherent with being a human being, but to acknowledge that it is so and utilise these differences (all differences imaginable; not just those revolving around \textbf{gender}) to humanities advantage?Once again, if someone working or studying in a relevant field could educate and enlighten me, that would me much appreciated.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Falcon500xw Well, I have not officially studied or done field work related to this particular issue but I think I can contribute resourcefully to your question and would be delighted if someone more knowledgable corrected me or if I got feed back from you, yourself.I think the take away from the fight against \textbf{gender} roles (which I am not in favor of, myself) is that people should be able to act however or participate in whatever jobs or activities they like (so long as no one is being hurt against their will) without fear of ridicule or violence. Basically, we shouldn't shame or judge people based on who they are or what they like or want to do. I don't see any reason that roles which are gendered shouldn't exist so long as the above doesn't happen and no one is intentionally excluded. While I think that barriers DO exist to women in certain fields that don't need to be there and if were removed from our society you'd likely see more women in those fields, I essentially see \textbf{nothing} wrong in a certain career choice being over- or undersaturated with a certain \textbf{gender} based on the innate characteristics of that \textbf{gender}. However, when I really think about it, I can not think of any case were having an active, existing \textbf{gender} role does not create the problems that I previously said I wished to avoid. Likewise, I am highly skeptical as to the degree to which characteristics are innate to a \textbf{gender} or to which they might naturally cause an individual job or career choice to be over- or undersaturated in a specific \textbf{gender}. When I think of this I consider hunter-gatherer type societies (which tend to be more egalitarian). Usually when we think of this we think of it in terms of "men are hunters, women are gatherers", however, when we look at modern accounts of contemporary hunter-gatherer societies we find that, while some jobs are done by a certain \textbf{gender} more often, at any one point both genders actively participate in every necessary activity. I would recommend using "The Forrest People" and the Mbuti tribe as a reference for this.If you can think of a \textbf{gender} role that could exist without causing the problems I said I wanted to avoid above I would be skeptical but interested in talking it out with you.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}9/398 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.261 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small + Sean Sultan one \textbf{gender} role (or possibly more aptly said: \textbf{gender} stereotype) is that women tend to have greater attention to detail. Because of this, a large Aerospace company specialising in Titanium machining has a larger proportion of female machinists at one of their facilities. However the exact number, I'm not aware of (something in the region of 70:30, female:male).\textbf{Gender} roles to not (at least in my understanding) preclude anyone from acting however or participate in whatever jobs or activities they like. They merely make doing this difficult in certain cases.But, I would argue that anyone ridiculing someone because of their choices not aligned with typical \textbf{gender}-roles is most likely a sexist asshole, and not singularly pro-\textbf{gender} roles.Basically Sean, I am staunchly against being a sexist dick (regardless of what \textbf{gender} the aggressor is). However, I am also incredibly against the anti-\textbf{gender} roles freight train.By utilising certain \textbf{gender} roles (for instance: to be "the man of the house"), COMBINED WITH a personality conducive to the scenario (in this case: being a good leader). It should not be looked upon as some knuckle-dragging \textbf{ape} domineering his helpless partner.Furthermore, I would suggest that there are many other \textbf{gender}-roles that could be carried out by Ideal people. Generalising as to whether EVERYONE should be allowed to carry out \textbf{gender} roles or NO ONE should is the same space of argument that leads to \textbf{sexism}, \textbf{racism}, and just being a downright asshole."That guy is \textbf{black}, he must be a thug.""That girl is Asian, she must be good at mathematics.""Women can't drive."...All examples of being an asshole, and all coming about from unjust generalisations.Societies that (self-) regulate how people interact with one and other on a personal level, even when it works for the individuals, need to back the fuck down.

American Psychologist      "Intelligence: New findings and theoretical developments". American PsychologistNow, these are all still held as true by the bulk of the scientific community, and can be proven during testing. (Side note:  Pretty much the entirety of scientific community mocks feminists, because they keep attacking the \textbf{sexual} dimorphism page in wikipedia, changing validated research.  As if humans are the only species that exist that don't exhibit \textbf{gender} based difference.)The irony comes in the form of standardized testing.  Over the past twenty years or so, there has been a large increase of written math questions, and comprehensive science questions on standardized tests.The effect of this is such:  Math, science, history, and language all require large amounts of reading comprehension and language skills.  This makes the entirety of a standardized test skewed in a females favor, as they perform better with language.  Which results in the current standardized tests showing females are ahead of men in every subject.You'll notice a trend over the last 20 years or so as well, that females are performing better on these tests in general.Meanwhile, fluid g IQ tests show no difference at all, except in mathematics and language.  Which supports the original standing observation, that males are more logical, and females are more communicative. There are more physical limitation than \textbf{mental} limitations. As while one \textbf{sex} may be less apt to be able at doing something, it does not make it unable to do it, or slower than all of the other \textbf{gender} given the scope of a job.What is prohibitive, however, is natural strength.  You will not see many women in physical labor jobs, as most of them are completely unable to do them.There are many jobs where men are required to life 100+ pounds, over and over.  (And yes, OSHA doesn't like it, but it happens and it probably won't change anytime soon)This has a tendency to work against male favor however, as they are culturally expected to take these jobs, to fulfill a communities needs.  Whereas, females tend to occupy the majority of office jobs (which tend to pay better).\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender, Mental, Sex, Sexual & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}6/427 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.405 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Professional, It sounds like you are suggesting that it's ok for people to not learn to read or have basic reading comprehension skills. Whether or not women have an aptitude for reading or not is irrelevant as literacy is a necessity for education and for daily life in western culture. If anything, all you have done is point out how tragic the illiteracy rate is and how important it is to stress this in early learning, rather than showing how the education system is skewed against men.The left brain-right brain dichotomy has recently seen a lot of scientific scrutiny and skepticism. There is real evidence piling up against the idea that individuals use one side of their brain more than another or that there is any significant divide and against the idea that certain hemispheres are associated with certain cognitive tasks such as math and science or language and arts. NPR has a great article on this with links to the original literature:  [LINK]  The real truth is likely more along the lines that each person's brain has a different way of doing a task but everyone has the same capability to do those tasks.In regards to physical strength, while it's true that men naturally tend to have more muscle mass and upper body strength there aren't really a whole lot of jobs that require quite that much lifting. As a firefighter I found that it is just as important to have good endurance as well as strength and plenty of women have more than enough of both. I think the real issue is that society expects women to not be bulky and discourages women from attaining the physical strength they are capable of. In high school I saw a lot of women who had no confidence in their physical abilities and thus didn't even try in gym class and became all noodlie and soft. Conversely, when I took weights training there, I saw women who could easily keep up with the men in terms of endurance training and muscle conditioning. So, while I recognize that there is a tangible difference in strength between men and women I don't think it's that significant for most labor jobs (which, like firefighting, only require that you are able to perform a pack test and that you can lift up to 75lbs) and that the real issue is confidence related to social conditioning.I also don't really see companies favoring women for office jobs over men that much. If you can find me some figures I'd be interested, but my initial intuition is that most office jobs are occupied by men and men are more likely to get promotions and raises in office type settings. And as a person who is part of the science community I don't see a lot of mocking of feminists so much as embracing. Most of my professors and many of my peers were feminists themselves and often stressed the importance of women in science and the \textbf{gender} gap in geology.In all fairness, however, I do recognize that there are some cognitive tasks that one \textbf{sex} does better than the other. While it is not true that men are more logical or rational than women we are able to visualize three dimensional space better and thus have an advantage in navigational skills. Women aren't naturally more communicative but they do have an advantage when it comes to language, both verbal and body. Despite this, I have known women who are better at navigation with much better directional intuition than myself who has studied map interpretation and spent a lot of time developing directional intuition as part of my job and career goals, and men have been very influential in the field of linguistics and are often just as capable as women when it comes to interpreting and translating other languages.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender, Sex & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/645 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.31 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Professional, maybe I should have been clearer when I said I was a firefighter. I fought wildland fires, the requirements are different. Since we have to \textbf{hike} long distances and work long hours and aren't expected to carry people around (we would call in structural firefighters in instances where homes or buildings were under threat) we are more concerned with endurance. Sorry for the confusion. I suppose I should also explain that it's probably the most misogynistic environment I've ever been in and that might have skewed my opinion.I'm sorry that I seemed to have touched a nerve with my comment about reading and I did not mean to imply that you actually had this point of view. The fact is that when you say that having standardized written tests (which I've taken and seemed pretty understandable to me) disadvantages men because men can't read as well as women it sounds like you're saying that it's understandable and normal for men to not have basic reading comprehension (to me, anyway). Upon hearing this information I would likely stress teaching reading comprehension at young ages rather than complain that the system is skewed against men. I have issues with the education system and standardized tests, myself, but it's not the fact that they are in a language or that they are written. I don't think that you would complain that a test at the end of a class constantly and consistently works off of ideas built upon in the beginning of the class even though some people may not have as good a grasp on those ideas as others.Who the fuck is "we"? And isn't your accusation of ad populum applicable to your argument as well? I didn't state that the "evidence" was popular just that it defied the science that you were citing and suggested that it might be a little dated. You are the one who was saying that there was a scientific consensus (which, by the way, source?).When I said soft and noodlie I was referring to a lack of muscle mass not the texture of their skin. Or wait, were you being intentionally obtuse? Oh, you dog! You got me!The men in your high school must have been enormous, I've never been able to bench anywhere near that. I had a friend who was a line man and he said he could squat something like that (600lbs seems like a lot but also kind of right?), but I don't know anyone who could really bench quite that much. For the most part we were benching around 150-200lbs and the ladies about 140-175lbs.When I was thinking of an office job I was thinking of things more along the lines of an accountant, a lawyer, administration, investment broker, computing, computer programing, IT, jobs you find in movies or tv shows named things like "the office" or "Office Space". That include secretaries but also a lot of other types of jobs, some of which tend to be male dominated. To paint secretarial jobs or dental hygienists as characteristic of the majority of office jobs is not really honest.If you are in medicine I would also expect you to know that just because two or more tasks are associated with one region of the brain does not mean that that part of the brain is solely responsible for that task. The article I cited from npr talked about how there is no left-right division of the brain in humans of any \textbf{sex} and there is no left-right association with certain tasks. In fact, the 'evidence' shows that, "like other complex skills, the ability to understand what we read or what someone is saying to us requires both hemispheres, working together and separately." -  Dr. Kara D. Federmeier professor of psychology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Thus no one is disadvantaged by standardized tests being written in a language understood by the recipient. Likewise, just because women have a statistical advantage on learning language does not mean that they are predisposed to talk or communicate (i.e. communicative). And just because a man can visualize three dimensional space does not mean that they are more rational (especially since logic is traditionally associated with the left hemisphere).So...no, I wasn't negating anything that I said but if you had actually read my references you'd know that.I'm glad that we can agree that both men and women can learn to do tasks that are statistically easier for the other \textbf{gender}, however, my point was that \textbf{gender} stereotypes create an attitude that a person shouldn't or can't try just because of \textbf{gender}. I think it is far more powerful to say that these are things anyone can do and that it is important to learn from each other.I find it odd that you accuse me of being rude in a comment I have difficulty finding areas where you AREN'T rude. Two wrongs, my friendMy experience of how professionals in the medical field compared to scientists in the rest of the physical sciences are educated and work is that they are vastly different. While I recognize that medical professionals contribute to literature, have their own conventions and there are certain careers that involve research I would not exactly say they are as involved as many chemists, physicists, or indeed geologists in science in terms of contribution, reading and application of literature, interacting with scientists in other fields, or in lab and field research. In geology we are constantly reading literature and interacting with professionals and academics.

Or wait, were you being intentionally obtuse? Oh, you dog! You got me!"And my response, which you are ignoring, is that testosterone is what is used to make muscle mass.  Men have more bulk testosterone, more women have bulk estrogen.But thanks for taking a serious topic, and making childish play of ignoring the exact response that counter-indicated your statements.  Childish."The men in your high school must have been enormous, I've never been able to bench anywhere near that."Marcus and Travis both broke 400 pounds. Both before their \textbf{senior} year.  Raytown South High School should still have their records on file, call them up."I had a friend who was a line man and he said he could squat something like that (600lbs seems like a lot but also kind of right?),"600 is an awfully dangerous amount to squat, due to the range of motion required by your lower back.However, men can bench press over 1,000 pounds if they train every day.  The world record is over 1,100 pounds.Likewise, if you take the lower back out of the equation, a male can leg press over a ton.  The world record being MULTIPLE presses of over 2300 pounds." but I don't know anyone who could really bench quite that much. For the most part we were benching around 150-200lbs and the ladies about 140-175lbs."I myself bench 260.  But yes, the majority of us are rather unhealthy fools that don't exercise daily."When I was thinking of an office job I was thinking of things more along the lines of an accountant, a lawyer, administration, investment broker, computing, computer programing, IT, jobs you find in tv shows named things like "the office" or "Office Space". That include secretaries but also a lot of other types of jobs, some of which tend to be male dominated. To paint secretarial jobs or dental hygienists as characteristic of the majority of office jobs is not really honest."Regardless of what you personally quantify as an office job, the statistics are non-biased."If you are in medicine I would also expect you to know that just because two or more tasks are associated with one region of the brain does not mean that that part of the brain is solely responsible for that task."WHICH IS WHY I NAMED THE THREE PARTS OF THE BRAIN, THAT ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TASK.  NOT ONE.Do not assume to lecture me child.  I do not tell you how to run around the forest putting out fires, do NOT lecture me on anatomy or the brain."The article I cited from npr talked about how there is no left-right division of the brain in humans of any \textbf{sex} and there is no left-right association with certain tasks."Yes, a biased radio show with a biased report appealing to the current trend for popular opinion."In fact, the 'evidence' shows that, "like other complex skills, the ability to understand what we read or what someone is saying to us requires both hemispheres, working together and separately." -  Dr. Kara D. Federmeier professor of psychology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign."And did you read that study?Hemispheric Differences in Memory and Language is the name of that study.  Again, don't assume to lecture me on a study that pulls her 6 figures of profit a year from feminist sources."Thus no one is disadvantaged by standardized tests being written in a language understood by the recipient."So a single biased, privately funded report, is enough to negate decades of research that indicates otherwise.  Interesting."Likewise, just because women have a statistical advantage on learning language does not mean that they are predisposed to talk or communicate (i.e. communicative)."Which is why female children are apt to speak first, and learn language first, when exposed to equal amounts of education on the matter, at equal ages.  Funny, every study ever done on the topic disagrees with you."And just because a man can visualize three dimensional space does not mean that they are more rational (especially since logic is traditionally associated with the left hemisphere)."And now you make yet another assumption that visualization has \textbf{nothing} to do with logical thought, when it has everything to do with mechanical ability.Einstein himself credited his own \textbf{mental} process to the THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS he did, which was simply a way of him saying, that he VISUALIZED how things worked in his head.Juvenile to make such assumptions based on research papers you, yourself, haven't even read.  Just going off of a NPR episode."So...no, I wasn't negating anything that I said but if you had actually read my references you'd know that."Yes child.  I've read the research itself.  I don't just listen to radio shows and gallop around like I know everything about a topic.Did you know you put out fires by throwing yourself onto them?  I figured you ought to know that, as a firefighter.  When you confront a fire, you toss yourself on it, and it goes away."I'm glad that we can agree that both men and women can learn to do tasks that are statistically easier for the other \textbf{gender}, "It doesn't seem so when you say.""disadvantages men because men can't read as well as women it sounds like you're saying that it's understandable and normal for men to not have basic reading comprehension""Just a few moments before you say that.  Seems to me like you don't understand the implications of what I am saying at all, but rather jumping to harsh conclusions."however, my point was that \textbf{gender} stereotypes create an attitude that a person shouldn't or can't try just because of \textbf{gender}."This goes back to nature vs nurture arguments, which would turn this discussion into something that it is not..Some kids that are beaten, will have a tendency to beat their children.Others will vow to never be like their parents, and wouldn't hurt a fly.Truth of the matter is, people that have it in them to triumph over difficulties excel.  Those who do not, falter.Regardless of how much you make life easier for those of us that back down under pressure, they will always have a tendency to back down under pressure.  They will not be babied their whole life, so is sheltering them from the harshness of the real world a solution?The real world is a competitive place.Perhaps instead of cowing to weakness, we should teach our children to be strong while under duress."I think it is far more powerful to say that these are things anyone can do and that it is important to learn from each other."And I think its better not to lie to children.  To teach them that life is hard, and they will not excel at everything. But knowing that, they should find the thing that they WANT to do, and excel at it.If you WANT to be a weight trainer as a \textbf{woman}?  DO IT.But we shouldn't rely on SOCIETY to tell these children such a thing.  That girls SHOULD be strong at math, because you get yourself into the very same problem your wishing to rid the world of.The major failing of the school system these days is not the core skills of math, science, history and language.The major failing of schools is that they don't give children a legitimate view on their future.We push kids through the school system, then they hit college, and still have no clue where they belong in the world.My sister, for instance, is a SPED teacher that has talked about how some elementary kids are taught Calculus.We're talking Calculus, to 7,8,9 year \textbf{old} children.  Do you seriously think \textbf{gender} plays a role in that?  No.  It does not.  Especially not in an environment that is 86 female. (teachers)"My experience of how professionals in the medical field compared to scientists in the rest of the physical sciences are educated and work is that they are vastly different. While I recognize that medical professionals contribute to literature, have their own conventions and there are certain careers that involve research I would not exactly say they are as involved as many chemists, physicists, or indeed geologists in terms of active participation in science in terms of contribution, reading and application of literature, interacting with scientists in other fields, or in lab and field research."You just said that geologists know more about the science in general, which includes that of a human body, more-so than those in medical professions.  That is conceited as hell.  Esp. from someone I can tell has never picked up a medical journal or a PDR."In geology we are constantly reading literature and interacting with professionals and academics."So do medical professionals.  So does any professional."Geology tends to be more hands on and contains more older students and post-bachs than other majors and my experience is that this gives even us younger and less experienced students more exposure to the professional and scientific community."Your train of logic is flawed.  Your taking medical science, and speaking about it as if its science as a whole.This is a comparison fallacy."If this is not your experience than I would be interested in hearing about it but right now I feel like you're being an arrogant jerk about this.""Meanwhile your being an absolute arrogant jerk.  Saying that because you deal with science, you know more about all sciences.Sorry, but you sound conceited as hell.You form opinions based on not just a singular study.  But one that was hosted on a liberal radio show, that is known for having bias towards feminist viewpoints. (the same group that FUNDED that study.)That is like believing a study, funded by the tobacco companies, about how healthy cigarettes are.Sorry, but your the one being arrogant here.I don't go to your work and tell you how to fight fires, you shouldn't assume to correct me over research that you don't even understand.Especially after purposefully ignoring the proof I have given.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Dumb, Gender, Mental, Nothing, Old, Senior, Sex, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Age - Youngsters, Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}11/2008 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.548 \\  \hline

Man have problems, due to their \textbf{gender}. Great. They are free, and have \textbf{nothing} in their way to fight for their rights. Women have problems too. But their problems is not defended by men, their problems is not even viewed as problems by the majority of society. 1 every 6 women will be raped during their life time, and still, even though everyone above say that men have problems too, it seems quite unclear why women suffer so much, and little has been done, throughout the history, to solve this type of problems. WAIT A MINUTE. Remember than MAN are the one's who majorly rape women. I wonder, why is that this problem hasn't been addressed with full potential.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small While I appreciate the intent, what you described was very much an outsiders view of what being a man is like. You were closest with the bit about "harmless jabs to assert dominance." \textbf{Sexism} doesn't hurt men because it expects certain tastes as much as it hurts them in the contradictions of manhood. For example, men "must" be into \textbf{sex}, but every expression of male sexuality is scorned. Men must be good providers but not materialistic. Men "must" and "must not" exhibit dominance or leadership.This bleeds into assumptions we make about men. Everything a man does is with agency -even as a child. Therefore a man in need of help has proved himself unworthy of it. A man who cries is unworthy of comfort. Mistakes are punished rather than corrected.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Ultimately, its an effect of phonemic language, predicated on Binary opposition rather than integration, spectral dynamism, holism, etc. Obviously this goes back a ways... (just 40-65kya or so), but the either/or binary thinking is certainly massively overemphasized in the contemporary culture, and thus habituated at an unconscious level. Earlier forms of language (speaking Pan-human here, not culturally specific), were predicated on what is being called "range semantics" - i'll let Wim van Binsbergen (Anthropologist Emeritus, Univ. Leiden) explain: Binsbergen states; 'It is as if the *Borean (reconstructed pan-human linguistic substratum) words (or, to be more precise, the vowel-unspecified word cluster with the same consonantal structure) had a meaning that is not calibrated at one specific point in the semantic range between ‘wet' and ‘dry', but that indicates the entire range, leaving it to context to determine which position on this range is meant. Such ‘range semantics', as a general characteristic of *Borean, reveals a mode of thought that is very different from the triadic mode often found in the literate Eurasian civilisations from the Bronze \textbf{Age} on, and even (because of the fluid range semantics which implies an absence of firm juxtaposition) from the dyadic, binary oppositions which Lévi-Strauss thought (apparently erroneously) to be a human universal and even the very basis of human  culture.'…Thus in *Borean, a particular lexical root may indicate not so much either ‘wet' or ‘dry', ‘penis' or ‘vulva', ‘dark' or ‘light', but any specific variable value in the ranges ‘degree of wetness  dryness', ‘genital of either genders', ‘degree of lightness  darkness'. Firm, sustained, consistent, absolute logical distinctions would thus appear to be post-*Borean. Their emergence and installation, ultimately to become standard, should in the first place be regarded as a result of intensified use of articulate language (and of the socio-organisational, productive and ritual practices facilitated by, and engendering, articulate language) since the Upper Palaeolithic. It might then be correct to say that the subsequent, increasing dominance of such binary distinctions in human culture was largely brought about by the pivotal role of increasingly precise and technical language in the context of the post-Neolithic package of writing, the state, the money economy, proto-science, and organized religion.'

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Thank you SO MUCH for making this video. I have up until recently taken a step back when it came to \textbf{sexism}, because I've felt like the undivided attention was unequally put on women. It seems like when people hear "It's time to stop crying like a girl – and man up" they only hear the first part; about the \textbf{sexism} towards women. But this places an unfair burden on men as well, as we are taught from an early \textbf{age} always to suppress our emotions and never show weakness. From personal experience this is extremely mentally and emotionally exhausting. So it is very unfair, and tackling feminism from one side only solves half the problem. You can't build a bridge from one side alone.I remember when they were "banning 'bossy'" all the focus was women and their ability to be natural leaders without being a 'ballbuster', and with that to stop putting a negative connotation on being 'bossy'. Well, what ever happened to boys in that debate? You can't tell a young boy to "stop crying like a girl" and "man up (and take charge)" and then expect them to grow up thinking that the \textbf{gender} roles are equal. The attention need to be given to boys/men as well.We can teach a girl to be proud of her \textbf{gender}, as she should be, but then stop teaching boys the opposite. I am a feminist (\textbf{gender} equalist) and it makes me furious when women say "Well men have treated us like s*** for so long that now its our turn". What does that really do? How is that supposed to help? That's not feminism to me, that's \textbf{sexism} towards men. So let's actually join hands and fight together, instead of sending mixed signals to young boys and girls.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Gender, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}7/300 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.333 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I really like this video but I think that your analysis is somewhat flawed. It seems to me that the \textbf{gender} roles present in our society that define "Masculine" and "Feminine" originate from taking the defining features of males and females as present in a sexually dimorphic species like ours and then pushing them to their extremes. For example, the idea that a man should be strong comes from the fact that men are physiologically stronger than \textbf{woman}, and so that trait is amplified to create a \textbf{gender} norm. And equally the idea that a \textbf{woman} should be nurturing comes from the fact that women are physiologically more emotional and caring, so that characteristic is again pushed to its extremes to create a \textbf{gender} role.And for every \textbf{gender} role there is an equal and opposite \textbf{gender} role too. Eg. Man - Tough, \textbf{Woman} - Weak, Man - Aggressive, \textbf{Woman} - nurturing. The list goes on and they are all equally baseless but seem to stem from ancient power dynamics between men and women due to our \textbf{sexual} dimorphism and our very human need to be the best at whatever we do or whatever we choose to define ourselves by.So I would tend to believe that \textbf{sexism} does not come from the idea that men have to be everything not \textbf{woman}, but because men and women have to be everything not \textbf{woman} and man respectively.Obviously there is no doubt that women have come out on the bottom of this power dynamic historically but now that we, in the western world, have progressed to a point where rights are genderless, both men and women are facing an incomparable level of pressure as the \textbf{gender} roles are dissolved and we struggle to redefine ourselves as humans.All in all my point is that I don't believe this is a case of society vs women as much as it is a case of society vs social expectations. The fight for individuation is a long and difficult one for everyone.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender, Sexism, Sexual, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}14/338 & \cellcolor{green!5}4.142 \\  \hline

If I ever cried in front of others it would only make things worse as the jeering started about how I was a crybaby and how boys aren't supposed to cry.And many of the jeering kids learned that "men don't show emotions" from their parents or the movies they watch. My own father, whenever I'd get upset and start crying, would stand there and yell "Stop crying!" at me like it was something I could just stop.Fact is, we grow up and start realizing that it's \textbf{dumb} to judge others, but those early life experiences don't go away.

I for one have never been put down or ridiculed for showing emotion or pain or equated to being "girly." Though I have seen it used, so there is a point to the argument. However, there is other forms of \textbf{sexism} besides being feminine in nature for guys. For one, I can't take my daughter to the park and play without getting the "pervert" stare for being a guy in the area of kids, caring for a child No joke, I was once called a pedophile for pushing my little girl on the swing. I can't walk down the same street as \textbf{woman} without hearing "stalker" remarks or having accusations of "creeping" under hushed breaths when I am only walking to work, since I had no car at the time. the \textbf{sexism} faced by men is that we are intrinsically evil and perverse. That if some crime is committed involving a man and a \textbf{woman}, the man is most often blamed and will suffer greater legal action than his female counterpart. There are many forms of \textbf{sexism}, experienced by both sides.Now, I do commend Laci for making the video, even if many view it with jaded lenses, she at least made an effort to open a dialogue. And even though I see the point they are making, I don't think it was her intention to make it "all about women." You have to tackle the issue some how, so why not start there.

But the core of this, the reason behind thee sexist views, comes down to the perception that men and women must stick to their own \textbf{gender} roles. Men face \textbf{sexism} from women and men, and women face \textbf{sexism} from women and men. What feminists try to do, both male and female femisnits, is address all \textbf{sexism} - not just \textbf{sexism} against women by men, but \textbf{sexism} against women from other women (girl hate), and \textbf{sexism} against men by women.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Corinn Heathers"Check your definitions. An "egalitarian" is a person who seeks equality of social standing and status for all people. Egalitarianism is about socioeconomic issues, not about \textbf{gender} issues and does not directly speak about issues such as \textbf{sexism}, \textbf{misogyny}, \textbf{homophobia}, transphobia, \textbf{sex} essentialism, slut-shaming and other issues that are central focuses of feminism."You couldn't be more wrong."Egalitarianism is the position that equality is central to justice. It is a prominent trend in social and political philosophy and has also become relevant in moral philosophy (moral egalitarianism) since the late twentieth century. In social and political philosophy, the main focus of the debate is on two different trends, the Equality-of-What trend and the Why-Equality trend. The authors of the older, first trend focused on the main question, what the goods of distribution are (resources, equality of opportunity for welfare, and so forth) and according to which standard one should distribute the goods. The question, in the late twentieth century is, whether equality is the most or one of the most important part(s) of justice or whether it has no or nearly no importance for the nature of justice at all. Egalitarians believe that justice and equality are closely connected; prioritarians, instead, emphasise that the two concepts are unrelated. This article gives an overview of the main arguments and objections in the Why-Equality debate. These are the by-product objection of equality, the objection of inhumanity, the objection of complexity, the argument of the presumption of equality, and the argument for a pluralistic egalitarianism."-IEP"Egalitarians think, firstly, that unfair life prospects should be equalized. Secondly, that equality is the most or one of the most important irreducible intrinsic or constitutive worth(s) of justice. Thirdly, that welfare should be increased. Fourthly, that justice is comparative. Fifthly, that inequalities are just when otherwise advantages are destroyed in the name of justice. Lastly, that there are certain absolute humanitarian principles like autonomy, freedom or human dignity."-IEP\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender, Homophobia, Misogyny, Sex, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General, Sexual Identity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}5/326 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.534 \\  \hline

However, if you use RAIN's statistics, and assume that there are no duplicate's you could find an even lower number. Using the average life time of a \textbf{woman}, and then multiplying that by the number of reported assaults, you come up with 20 million victims, meaning just 3.3 million rapists, or 2.2 of the population.

But my point is that women are flourishing in the job place these days.And if you want more women to be elected, then get more women to run. I'd be interested in seeing a breakdown of the percentages of how often women lose when they run for office versus how often a man loses. Percentagewise, women are lacking in political offices, because political \textbf{race} for \textbf{race}, less women are running for office than men, not because people don't want to vote for women.For the record, I agree with the points this video made, but I also think there's a lot of fallout from women. If a man cries in a relationship, I'd be willing to bet a large quantity of women will think he's unmanly, and will want to dump him. And plenty of girls bully boys who are smaller than them.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@John Harrison I'm not unsympathetic to circumcision, I'm unsympathetic to the fact that you're trying to grasp at straws and make me look like a bad person because you're mad I'm a feminist, but these are my opinions and \textbf{nothing} I say is anything you can't find factually supported by evidence. YOU live in a bunch of anti-fem propaganda that either a) doesn't relate or matter to feminism or b) has been purposefully twisted and then fed to you but it stilled in lies that you seem to believe is the truth. This video, and my comment, was about my frustration with men not taking their injustice seriously with simultaneously undermining female social injustice. Not circumcision. I'm not in a place to comment on circumcision. I'm not a parent, and I've never seen or read about uncut penises. Not my forte or my interest. Laci knows more about that. There's no significant evidence that suggest a man is losing out on something like mobility or pleasure, or that it is traumatic because it happens on babies UNLIKE female circumcision that happens when females are teens, can cause death from preventing menstruation, and prevents any \textbf{sexual} pleasure from \textbf{sex}. So I don't think they are the same thing. HOWEVER, circumcision is a dying fad, more and more babies are being born uncut, and I don't think a lot of females have any preference whatsoever. Circumcision most likely will not be socially acceptable in the next generation or two, so why are you yelling at me about it?

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I keep seeing comments that are taking what Laci said to the extreme. I think the message we as a society should take away from this video is NOT that all men need to stop being masculine, but rather that they not be afraid to be feminine. The same applies to women, they should not be afraid to be masculine. The overall idea is not to have men and women switch \textbf{gender} roles, but to have more options open to all sexes. No one is saying that men should stop being protective, or that women should stop being nurturing but that we all should be allowed to emulate those things if we want to and have the capability to.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/119 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.84 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Gender roles and normalities cause a lot of societal pressure on women, but this statement by Laci just goes to show you that men feel these pressures as well. \textbf{Gender} is not a \textbf{black} and white topic, and neither are their roles. We are all human and we all should be able to express emotions the way we feel them, pursue hobbies that intrigue us, and love who we love. And whether or not you've consciously felt these pressures in your own life, do not dismiss them as ridiculous and not true, because people have felt them and do feel them everyday. If a boy actually enjoys his drama class, he could be called "\textbf{g\textbf{ay}}" because people use that synonymously with femininity, making the boy in drama club less of a male than say the quarterback on the high school football team. Again, this is just an example for a multifaceted problem in western culture. Not all athletes are stoic and violent, and not every drama kid is \textbf{g\textbf{ay}}. These are just stereotypes we, as a society, put onto those types of actions and interests. \textbf{Sexism} against men is real, however, it is executed with feminine synonyms as though femininity and being a \textbf{woman} is a bad thing. I think that was what Laci's point to this video was, and I agree with her.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Gay, Gender, Sexism, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Gender - General, Sexual Identity - General, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality & \cellcolor{green!27}9/224 & \cellcolor{green!27}4.018 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Laci Green, thank you so very much for all the things you say. The world could learn so much from you. Being "like a women" is so bad that I personally have experienced bullying and discrimination for being feminine. I am a girl, and yet since a young \textbf{age} have been tormented for liking to wear skirts and disliking sports. I can't tell you how many times I have been called as girly girl as an insult. People associate it with being weak. Many girls are pressured into being more "like a man" to succeed and be seen as strong people. The problem is still much worse for men. To have a place in society, and be accepted you have to fit into the tight box that is violence and aggression, power and control. I feel like the world would be a more peaceful place if being sensitive and caring sometimes was accepted more regularly. There would be less violence. People should be able to be who they want to be, how they feel inside, not what society says they should be because of what's in there pants. A human should not be always aggressive, not always passive, but should be both and neither. I have hopes and dreams for the future, and we can all make a difference by never bullying someone for being feminine, boy or girl. Thanks so much to all who care :D\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/237 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.422 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Was there a single stereotype of \textbf{gender} that was not included in this video? These \textbf{gender} specific identifiers are not the result of \textbf{sexism}. They are a result of socialization and human sexuality. It is about finding a \textbf{sexual} partner and advertising yourself as being a potential \textbf{sexual} partner. We have stereotypes that are generalizations made from traditional patterns that are typical in Western European civilization. Some of these can be generalized to include all modern societies. Some are derivative of general physiological dissimilarities of sexes from human biology.We have brains and we can decide that any or all of this social baggage is crap and decide personally not to subscribe to some or perhaps all of it, but that is hard, because we are social animals and the choices we make as individuals have consequences on our socialization with others. If you are a heterosexual male and one of your priorities is to engage in \textbf{sex} with the human females that exist around you, then you have to compromise what you do and how you present yourself to maximize your chances of consensual \textbf{sex}. I guarantee that if you eschew all the "male" markers/identifiers you will find far fewer opportunities for \textbf{sex} with any partner you would want to have \textbf{sex} with.Personally, because I am attracted to smart, intelligent, self-reliant people like you, I present myself as a sincere feminist, a) because I am a sincere humanist and believe in human equality for all without qualification and b) because I know that I will be more attractive to people I want to have \textbf{sex} with with I am not an arrogant, selfish, belligerent sexist-bigot.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender, Sex, Sexism, Sexual & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}10/277 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.61 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small To all the men saying it's human biology that we want men to aspire to be dominant and women to be submissive, that whole argument is bullshit that's been fed to you by society. In hunter gatherer and tribal societies there is almost no \textbf{gender} specialization. For example, men tend to hunt and women tend to gather in hunter gatherer societies, but when the men go on hunting trips they forage to survive, and if a women out gathering sees an animal that they have the equipment to hunt, they will try to kill it. There are no biological reasons for \textbf{gender} roles, \textbf{gender} specialization, or \textbf{sexism}, because they are cultural constructs. As much as \textbf{racism}, \textbf{race}, religion, language, and money.The idea of what's attractive (except for maybe symmetry in the face, that's still up in the air, since it's almost universal) is also a cultural construct. Not every culture paints tall, strong and muscular men as attractive, just like not every culture paints small, \textbf{skinny} women as attractive. And the whole men aren't supposed to show emotion is complete shit. In Japan (until recently) no one was supposed to show emotion in public, least of all people in power, male or female. The same with Eastern European leaders. In many indigenous cultures of the Americas and Africa no one cares if someone shows emotion. Some of them, like the Mbuti (Pygmies), will exaggerate their emotions, or used to, at least.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender, Race, Racism, Sexism, Skinny & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General, Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical Features & \cellcolor{green!5}7/242 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.893 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Having someone acknowledge that the culture of \textbf{misogyny} hurts not only women but men who 1) don't fall in line and act like one of the guys and 2) don't meet the expectations placed upon them means so much to me and makes me want to cry. But I can't, anymore. I would also add that this sort of \textbf{sexism} hurts the cause of feminism because the expectations and stereotypes of men make me initially suspect by the women I befriend and an outcast among certain male groups, including those in positions of authority. I think the fear of being rejected as some kind of traitor by men and turned away as a wolf in sheep's clothing by women prevents a lot of possible friendships.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Misogyny, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/125 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.6 \\  \hline

This whole calamitous battle has been incredibly stressful. I don't want to be angry at other gamers, but I can't help it when my opinions and desires for the hobby have them classifying me as an enemy to be defeated.You're the first person on the "other side" who hasn't made me nervous about voicing my opinions. Well, sure, I don't know you, and if you decided to classify me as the enemy, it wouldn't affect my life much. But you didn't, and that's important. It's possible to disagree on things without hate.It's hard to remain objective about these things when everything is so polarized. Because I don't think Anita Sarkeesian is a horrible person (nah, she's just a mediocre feminist pop culture critic with some good marketing/production skills), because I don't buy the whole "filthy SJW" thing, because I am really upset about what's been happening to women in the industry recently (even if I don't agree with them, and there are many I don't agree with), time and time again if I'm honest, I get pegged as "the enemy."I just want to play games that represent me, and a lot of the backlash that's been mixed in with GG seems to be coming from conservative gamers who don't like the way gaming is heading. I've argued and fought with them, people who use the hashtag, and it's like, okay, fine, you don't want to play a game like Analogue: A Hate Story. That's fine, but why does the existence of a feminist sci-fi visual novel hurt you? If you don't like it, don't play it.In my "ripe \textbf{old} \textbf{age}" of thirty, I've become far less tolerant of my lack of fair representation in gaming. And when I talk about what I want to see happen, people scoff, they don't take me seriously, they wonder why I can't just "get over it" and play games with male protagonists (p.s. I can, I just prefer not to because it harms immersion when I can't identify with the player character), they get angry or defensive when I complain about the female characters I do get being portrayed as ridiculous \textbf{sex} objects.So yeah, wow, it's 1AM and I need to do some writing for nanowrimo before I get too sleepy.

Because the companies who hire us are legally allowed to pay me less than my male counterparts, who do you think they will hire? Me, Of course! I do not want less wages than the men, I want equal pay \& untill there is equal pay then there will be an unfair disadvantage to the men in the interview waiting room.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The endless bullshit argument, that feminism is about, 'equality'. Feminism only works in bringing about equality, in the belief that society is inherently biased towards men and needs making equal. In turn bringing equality of the sexes. Most main stream feminists don't fight for any problems men face in Society and focus solely on Women. A large majority don't even believe men have any problems within Society. If anything, they blame men for the majority of problems, shoot any man down who seeks to talk about his issues and tries to unbalance the, 'playing field', towards women. To be a feminist you would have to believe men face hardly any problems within society compared to women. That is what feminism is. That is what the ideology has always been about and that is the premise it was created around. This on its own, is why a lot of men and women in the Western part of the World, refuse to label themselves as feminists. As a Society, we all have issues, i.e \textbf{gender} stereotypes for a start. Something which does affect both sexes, which very few feminists will talk about from the perspective of both genders(Laci Green has taken it from the perspective of both genders). Some issues affect women more than men, others men more than women. Yet men's issues are rarely spoke about by feminists. If a man tries to voice them, it's, 'Shut up your a man. Listen to us!'. Even if we take feminism by the skewed perspective, that it is generally about fighting for the equality for both sexes, in the belief that we have problems both side of the field; which would be egalitarianism. The actions of mainstream modern feminists contradicts that. Women like Jessica Valenti, Anita Sarkeesian and so forth who take personal opinion which is subjective and turn it into a World view we should all hold. If the men don't hold that view, they're misogynists, they're this negative stereotype or that negative stereotype. It is just becoming ridiculous, being an unpleasant character isn't something feminism is going to solve. If anything it amplifies it. If a guy wants to criticize a \textbf{woman}, or vise versa, based on their appearance or on a stereotype. Telling them it's wrong, won't change that. Educating them on the subject, won't change that. Vilifying a fucking \textbf{gender} like men, won't change that. Unpleasant people, will keep being unpleasant because that is their nature. These are deep seated psychological impulses.At the end of the day, until someone comes along in the mainstream and says look, Society has issues, for both men and women. Let's work together as humans, to solve this. Then we are going to keep seeing constant uproar. Both genders have there downfalls, no ones perfect.

Female child abuse tends to be a result of heavily chauvinistic family behaviour - man hits women to get her to shut kids up.  Women hits kids, kids hit dog, its called a hierarchy of violence and is a hallmark of male supremacist parenting.  The other place where significant levels of child abuse happen is where \textbf{woman} has been abandoned by child's father to do his share of parental work on her own.  This is largely like criticising a football team for their game losses when they only have half the players of the other side.  Am not saying women cant/dont abuse children or men, but I think in a male supremacist society, there are huge issues around women and children's right to equal humanity from men that are not being addressed.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/216 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.463 \\  \hline

It is a shame because she would have made an excellent Civil engineer and would have no doubt would have contributed a lot to the field and society in general.  When i entered the work force after Uni i also saw how easy it was for me to succeed compare to my female counterparts that are just as good and work just as hard as i did.I am a competitive guy but i would rather win fair and square. As such I do want a level playing field so that when i win i know i deserved it and not because my boss thinks that girls are just too emotional, too bossy, over think things and not just do it. Yes this is what my boss told me when i had a drink with him and asked him what clinched it in the end for me over a female colleague of mine.What is really damaging though is the result at least where i live is that males are just coasting as a result and girls working twice as hard because they understand that things are generally not in their favor.  In my niece's class this year the top 20 of her level are all girls.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@MrUtak \@Jasmine Lin  Please read everything I've said below before commenting.I'm pretty sure Egalitarianism started earlier than Feminism. I mean the word itself wasn't made until the late 19th century. Also Feminism is female driven. It is used to find equal ground with men in a political, social, and economic way. Feminism is only used to benefit women, men gain no social benefits from feminism unless they are feminists themselves (I mean in a self-satisfactory way). However when it comes to economic or political issues, women should be apart of it. You both believe that the reason why people don't identify as Feminists is because of extremists, that is not always true, people don't agree or identify, as or with Feminism because the word sounds like it centers around one \textbf{gender}...which it does. Also, I don't see what modern feminists are actually doing. All I see and hear are Feminists complaining about advertisements or entertainment or anything else that isn't a bigger issue. Feminism would get more support if it was aimed at other countries that don't have much equality between man and \textbf{woman}. I can't stress enough how Feminism and Egalitarianism are different. They are not synonymous just because you include struggles of men Jasmine.I want everyone to get civil rights and I especially want women to be more involved in politics (I mean strictly working in government.), more involved with education (Math and Science mostly), and I want women to be in more professional fields (it would help greatly with the economy). But the idea of women wanting to be socially equal to a man puzzles me a bit, because, like I said, modern feminists only complain about things in Pop Culture or Pop Sociology and that is all I've seen come out of modern feminists, I think feminism coming from us, a younger generation, is the reason. When it should just be centered around having normal social equality. I also want to say that there will never be total equality between males and females. No \textbf{gender} wants to be completely equal with each other. Men won't be able to do or have things just as simple as Women do and vice versa. If Feminism is to stick around,more people need to keep addressing global issues instead of tackling trivial issues. I do not identify as a Feminist.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@cjwilson908 Egalitarian values are noble and is inline with our values as a society in general. The problem is the execution. We can all hope and talk and wish for an equal opportunity, equal rights society but no amount of hoping and thinking about it will bring us closer to such society.It requires action. For example the slavery abolition movement, the civil rights movement, the \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} rights movement as well as the feminist movement has been successful mostly because it took action by said groups to make changes or at least bring the attention to the inequality of opportunity their groups face and or gross violation of their basic human rights compare to the rest of society.The declaration of universal human rights was in part our belief as a society that all are equal but as we have seen. Just because we declared it does not mean in reality it will be so as we clearly see now with these movements being the result. As a society we have failed in this regard.  The feminist movement at its core is about having a level playing field for both genders. It is equal opportunity and not equal outcome. The outcome will depend on the individual regardless of weather that person is a male or female. However making sure each got the same opportunity first is key.So if a guy got a pen and a paper then the girl should also get a pen and a paper. The outcome from that is up to the person and how they have used said pen and paper. It is not about taking the paper away from the guy and giving it to the girl if the girl does not have one but rather give the girl a paper as well if the guy already has a paper.As such it is not about taking anything away from guys but rather giving girls what guys where already given. It's about getting what everyone else has already gotten. It is the same theme with all these movements. Freedom like everyone else, basic civil rights like everyone else, basic right to marry like everyone else etc, equal opportunity like everyone else etc. So in effect it does works towards egalitarians value of an equal society by focusing on problems specific groups that are or still facingWe don't live in two separate worlds. What benefits women also benefits men. Predominantly we do marry each other in any case. The economy as you mentioned will also benefit and a good economy benefit all and not just women. It's a simple concept.I do agree though with the fluff things some feminist focus on now days like you mentioned.

I ask specifically about evidence of FEMINIST beating up men because you say by deeds feminist are violent similar to Islamic radicals because of what they say and do so I asked you for evidence of deeds. Where did I generalize?. As a matter of fact it is you. "Men are victims of nearly 3 million physical assaults in the USA". So you are saying that all these men were beaten up by feminist?. Now you \textbf{lump} all these women that abuse their husbands as feminist. What's next? All women are feminist?. You tell people to stay on point but you are the one that is all over the place. Even your counter argument regarding Islam is weak as. There are more than 1.5 billion Muslims in the world. If 1.5 billion Muslims are radicals then God help us all. \@Jean Frechette   Of course not. Men have it hard as well. I know because I am one lol!. Even most feminist here agree as well. They would argue though that women have it harder than men and why their specific focus on women. Where I am from at least I tend to agree with them. Interesting fact is that there are generally more women in Western counties and developed countries.The Global ratio is almost even. Countries like India and China have more boys. I suspect the culture in India and the one child policy in China contributed to this. \@Tessa Schweigart The egalitarian movement suits you best then. The problem I have with the egalitarian moment though is that I believe it is not very effective. Societies nowadays are more complex than ever. As such I do believe we need specific focus groups.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I In reference to the "feminism is just equality" argument. I can accept that feminism is at its core, an egalitarian movement, but I don't get how people can say that it's "about men too" The definition of feminism is not "men and women should be equal" it's advocacy of WOMENS rights. Therefore feminism also presumes that women are disproportionally disadvantaged in society, (a notion I find to be ridiculous). Besides there are numerous principles crucial to feminist theory that I disagree with, how could I be a feminist because of that one thing, that almost everyone believes anyways, reguardless of wether they identify as a feminist. If feminism's sole tenant is "men and women should be equal" then the word "feminist" means \textbf{nothing} because that is NOT a movement.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}1/130 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.769 \\  \hline

However where I am from (Asia/Pacific) women are generally are disproportionately disadvantaged from my observation working in many countries in this region and from personal experience.It seems like a \textbf{common} theme here is that people think that the feminism movement is only local to where they are and it does not apply Globally.In the end as you mentioned it is about women's rights against the backdrop of universal human rights. It is at core a rights issue and this is what feminist need to go back to. It is a movement because a group (a very large one at that) believe that their basic rights for example against discrimination is not being adhere too. Its about focus like for example the \textbf{black} civil rights movement in the US or the \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} rights movement. They are asking for what everyone already has.\@oneclick boedicea I commend you for your efforts and those other feminist that genuinely want a better more equal society for women as well. I do however seriously advice you guys to go back to what feminism is about which is a rights issue for women.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Joe Smith I completely understand what you mean. The point is, in some extent, it's true, women lack the knowledge and comprehension of what's the fight for men.I was talking to a friend of mine, a girl, and she said: "I wished I haven't been raped, or have male friends push into me and sexually abuse me, put their hands on my body as if I was being too difficult".Men's problem is \textbf{nothing} compared to actual \textbf{sexual} harassment. And that's what generally drive women into feminism, because they are supported by a community that understand them and accept them. They finally have voice.That's why feminism has a very important issue concerning women. My main problem with feminism is not about all of the problems you told me; those aren't women's problem, the same reason that we are not protesting against \textbf{sexual} harassment right now. Our problem is our own, and we have to fight for it, and I'm sure feminism will support this fight, for whatever reason related to \textbf{patriarchy}.What I disagree is the WAY most feminist talk to non-feminist. Instead of teaching, listening and exchanging knowledge, teaching the correct way, they rage and punish and make everyone feel embarrassed and pissed off. They are angry because most of them have been harassed, and this way they feel empowered, even though it's bad for the movement, and does not accomplish their ideals. I defend a pedagogical, educational position as a feminist. People need to be patient and teach, like Gracy is trying to do. She's trying to create awareness to taboos, so I excuse her in her mistakes, no one is perfect. Disagreeing is different from hating or being against them. Two movements will only create more trouble, in my point of view.I think the movement should unite, because they fight the same problem, but neither of them actually attack the source of the problem: it's not men, it's not women, it's a patriarchal culture, that's among us, in everyone of us, and it should be fought as a virus, that's invisible, and permeates every modern society, not personified in women or men. Everyone can be target, and it's no one's fault they don't know problems A B or C from their behavior.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Just to make a point, whatever it is DEFINED as is largely irrelevant in the framework of the ongoing debate. Feminism is unfortunately highly susceptible to being hijacked by radical elements who are as guilty of bigotry and suppression of the truth as those who they brand as oppressors. Examples of this have been all to \textbf{common} in the past few years as exemplified by the recent "shirtstorm" incident where (irrespective of the facts presented) a ESA scientist was subjected to significant levels of abuse. Never mind the fact he just helped land a probe on a comet. Meanwhile genuinely significant issues such as women's rights in the Islamic world are conveniently swept under the rug. The noble cause of female suffrage born in the UK has evolved into a brand of militancy characterised by ignorance and radicalism. Anti-feminist rhetoric, at least from the educated critics of feminist theory, tends to be a response not to campaigns for female rights but specifically a response to the militant nature of this new brand of feminism. Categorising all anti-feminist rhetoric as "reactionary drivel" (irrespective of whether it is substantiated criticism) is one of the main failures of modern day feminism-the inability to address criticism with anything more than a dismissive insult (note I'm not accusing ALL feminists of doing this) ensures that I for one, and I hope other members of the educated classes, fail to take it seriously.One further fundamental failing of radical feminism (the aforementioned "militant branch"-not all campaigners for female rights) is the tendency to blame everything on the "\textbf{patriarchy}" and portray the world as male dominated. To an extent this is true, the percentage of males in CEO positions and higher paid professions is often glaring-however the issue is often more complex than that. I won't bother to discuss it in dept there as it requires its own essay and can get quite protracted, but I will mention that it has been subjected to criticism on two grounds. Firstly, notable economists such as Thomas Sowell have argued that it doesn't even exist and secondly can be explained by the fact that the majority of individuals attaining degrees in the sectors of education which lead to the highest paid professions tend to be male. However radical feminism solely focuses on this, issues such as men being over-represented in physical labour and the LOWEST paid and most dangerous (defined as most susceptible to injury or death in the workplace) professions being swept under the rug (note-this only scratches the surface of situations in which females receive preferential treatment). What radical feminism does is single out issues where males do have the upper hand (for whatever reasons) while ignoring genuine male rights issues and refusing to acknowledge that they exist-this is called "cherry picking". The extent of such intellectual dishonesty is breathtaking. If you're a decent person you should be, not a feminist, but a "humanist". Female issues should not be prioritised and neither should male issues-a strong argument could be made for a level playing field where all \textbf{gender} issues receive representation. I have one final problem with the overarching theme of what you've said here and that's the decision to categorise all feminists in one single group regardless of whether they are militant or moderate whether they campaign about trivial bullshit or address genuine issues when they really, really are not one and the same.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Common, Gender, Patriarchy & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}3/567 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.529 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Professional One slight flaw with your argument-I never suggested that women should CONTINUE to campaign for suffrage. The fact that they already have the vote is testimony to that. What I was referring to was the campaign (notice the use of the past tense in my previous posts) to achieve female suffrage which the poster I replied to attempted to suggest wasn't a worthwhile cause. Thankfully the government in office had a little bit more sense than him. Now onto some of your claims:"9.   That is how active they are in the UK.  9 of your military is women.  That is superfair, considering 91 of men are active, and women are the voting majority huh?"No that's fair enough. The problem here is the statement made by the other poster:"a climate where only men can be forced or pressured by those politicians to die for their country?"I'm afraid that's simply not true. The fact females actually serve in the military (albeit in a smaller proportion to men) is testimony to that. Secondly the British Army is a purely volunteer force (as in we don't employ conscription) meaning NO ONE can be forced by the ruling elite to join the armed forces. The fact that it is predominantly a male force has \textbf{nothing} to do with the actions of politicians forcing them into service and everything to do with voluntary application for service. However this is largely irrelevant. Deciding who gets suffrage and who doesn't based purely on who's willing to serve in the armed forces is ludicrous. By a classic strawman extension we could argue that in britain only the 120,000 serving in the ranks should vote! After all they're the only ones "forced" into service with the vast majority of the male population lying idly at home. Bloody scroungers.Now let's consider sanity for a moment, and purely in relation to the argument presented by the other poster. Shouldn't factors such as,say, the fact that legislation introduced by the government having an impact on the lives of women in business, at home, in hospitals etc more important than factors such as serving in the military waging inconsequential foreign wars for shady reasons and withdrawing without achieving any concrete outcome?Now this drivel:"But don't worry, i'm sure you'll continue thinking "outweighs any military argument in my mind" until Greece gets fed up with its debt and pulls a WW2 Germany on the UK.It is kind of a small way to think about things to sit and think "To me that isn't relevant."  When it very much is, you just don't bother to think of it.You have to wonder, did \textbf{Nazi} Germany citizens think "To me that isn't relevant." when \textbf{Nazi}'s were blowing the shit out of neighboring countries?Like oh, that will never effect me, Germany has never been invaded."I rest my case.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nazi, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!27}2/480 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.417 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Flammablerock  I disagree, the analogy is alright, but it's a very flawed argument. Fem is under the false impression that I believe ANY group of people fighting for equal rights want supremacy rather than merely equal rights. \textbf{G\textbf{ay}} rights activism is now to what feminism was in the first half of the 20th century. It's not hard to see why Fem's comparison is simply wrong. I was obviously only talking about feminism, not all rights activists. No one would argue that women or \textbf{black} people had unequal rights at some time in our history, on a legal standpoint. The problem with Fem is she is under the impression (like the vast majority of feminists) that they still don't have equal rights, when on a legal standpoint, they absolutely do. On another standpoint, like societal double standards, there is inequality there for both men and women. That's why feminism doesn't work anymore. It just makes them feel and act like victims trying suck and squeeze every ounce of benefit in their favor, and it works, and they're still not satisfied.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Gay & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Sexual Identity - General, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality & \cellcolor{green!5}3/179 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.676 \\  \hline

The name "\textbf{g\textbf{ay}} rights" doesn't imply that it's about \textbf{homosexual} supremacy, does it?

Whenever someone goes out of their way to be in a group like this, there is likely a large bias on their end. They automatically take sides with a feminist whether or not that feminist is correct.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I get what you're going for but there's a fundamental core issue where you lose me.A lot of male pressures are genuinely good things to aspire towards. Physically fit, capable, socially connected... that's all shit everyone should work towards.Speaking from experience, using violence and intimidation usually falls into the same category as "being an emotional bitch". It's the inability to handle things in a socially respectible and selfless manner. We aren't expected to be unfeeling, just... not completely hostile, irrational \& uncooperative when we're upset. It's a sign of immaturity.The trick is that immaturity is socially percieved as acceptible \& expected of women. Men are the default \& women are on par with children as the designated role of the protected \textbf{sex} with limited power \& obligation beyond obedience. Most of the percieved injustices against men are ultimately extensions of disproporionately laying all the responsibility on them.That's my hang up with most branches of feminism. It doesn't often address that. It tends to gynocentrically focus on the problems of women (like the wage gap, objectification \& \textbf{sexual} violence) as something that needs fixing while dismissing almost all personal responsibility on their part. Not only that, but it usually places most of the blame \& responsibility on men (or society... which by extension of male privilege \& biased representation means men) to fix it.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Laci is using false logic. She says \textbf{sexism} is based solely in the prejudice of feminine traits - even going as far as to categorize trans-gendered people as being subject to \textbf{sexism} based on their feminine traits (which, you know, sort of ignores female to male transgendered people). \textbf{Sexism} is defined as prejudice based on your \textbf{sex}. This typically happens to women, true, but it can also happen to men (and to trans-women and trans-men too!). There is no advantage to limiting this definition to only women (or an attack on just feminine traits - it makes no sense).There is an interesting phenomenon happening here, and it seems like it happens a lot: the oppressed need oppressors to rebel against. Laci Green is actually demonstrating the affects of systemic chauvinism. She assumes that Men hold defacto power over her and her gender/\textbf{sex}, that this in not an arbitrary creation that we, as human beings, are all complicit in creating. She thinks that this creation is only the responsibility of men, which, in my opinion, makes her job easier. She has an oppressor to fight against (all men!). But this is a much more complicated issue and it comes down to how we work as human beings. If you look at history, it seems like it paid well to be a white man. But if you begin to dig into the details, you realized it paid well to be in the top 3 of the white male population!! That male suffrage (where every white male citizen was eligible to vote, only preceded white female suffrage by 10 - 20 years... not to mention the fact that white female suffrage preceded minority suffrage by 30-40 years!!). Laci lists all these masculine traits and doesn't even provide the most interesting statistic of them all: Men are 4 times more likely to die in a violent act than a \textbf{woman}. Think about that for a second. Men - because they're masculine - may not fear walking down a dark street at night, but maybe they should!The oppressor isn't men! It's 3 of men. It's those who we have given power over us (by voting for them or being complicit in a culture that allows a small group of people to rule over us). We play into their power by fighting amongst ourselves, by creating divisions amongst ourselves.

I'll try to explain this as simply and as easily as possible, to help you understand.The reason that I linked you to the articles on violence on transgendered individuals was to show that there is actual research that has been done to support Laci's original point. A theory, as I have already tried to explain, is NOT true fact (as the scientific definition of a fact is not as an absolute truth, but simply as a hypothesis that has gone through rigorous experimentation and observation to remove most doubts; it is simply a theory that has not been shown as false).Basically: Theory --> supported by a vast body of evidence. This is why I linked you to the results; had you taken the time to actually read look into some of them, you may notice that the statistics of violence against transgendered people are rather high. Furthermore, violence against mtf (male to female) transgendered individuals is much higher than the alternate situation (ftm, female to male), and is often perpetuated by men.However, I will give you the benefit of the doubt and propose something for you to argue (so that you can actually create a basis for your next response): If this history of violence is not due to men seeing \textbf{transgender}  women (male to female) as 'lesser', then why does it keep occurring?

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@itsazy If you're not going to even attempt to find an alternative explanation - as in, a reason beyond what Laci has suggested - then I don't see how there is any other reasoning beyond the information that's been given. However, I suppose that I should (once again) try to dull down what I have said so that you can understand.First off, the links to the scholarly articles were meant to show that extensive research has been conducted on the topic of transgendered issues, which was to support the fact that Laci's point is a valid theory (as violence against intersexed individuals is not lacking in relevant literature). Also, I pointed out that - had you read my first, original comment - Laci usually places citations or ways to get more facts on the statements she makes in the 'about' section below the video. However, you immediately ignored that.The point about male to female transgendered individuals relates to Laci's suggestion about how intersexed ftm people are more of a target for harassment and bullying and violence that mtf individuals. This statistic is significant as, again, the association with the feminine leads to a harmful and detrimental reaction from men who attempt to police and enforce masculinity....I should also point out that none of your responses actually propose a counter argument, and so don't seem to be worth my time. I am trying to hold back my condescension, out of politeness, but really, your ability to misinterpret my statements makes me wonder if, perhaps, this sort of discussion would be more fruitful in a few years, given time for you to develop and mature in regards to actually creating a proper response.And, again: if you can't find an alternate explanation, then I really don't see how Laci's point is wrong.PLEASE ACTUALLY FIND AN ACTUAL REASON AS TO WHY \textbf{TRANSGENDER} MTF VIOLENCE IS NOT RELATED TO MASCULINITY, and I will gladly 1) refute your point and 2) acknowledge that you have at least attempted a substantial, worthy argument.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Transgender & \cellcolor{green!27}Sexual Identity - Transexuality & \cellcolor{green!27}1/341 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.293 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Micah MacCallum There's a million and one reasons why people get attacked, though.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@itsazy Saying "there's a million and one reasons why people get attacked" is simply avoiding offering a substantial answer. The fact that (as the links I offered you were meant to show, had you checked out one or two of the studies) mtf intersexed individuals are at a greater risk of being violently harassed or physically bullied/attacked. Which is something that I have already pointed out many times before, had you taken the time to read and consider my previous comments. If mtf transgendered individuals being attacked was an uncommon occurrence, then I would agree that there are many reasons why a person may be attacked, but in this instance, we are specifically talking about MTF PEOPLE. Why is violence against them so much more prevalent, compared to the average individual?-->statistics that Laci cited:  [LINK] -->You can use the link that I'd already given you to scour the available information for more facts about why violence against transgendered individuals is prevalent, and not simply a 'random event.'There is also a connection in the fact that men are often put down for being 'girly' - note that many insults that are used as a degrading term by men relate to being a \textbf{woman}. For example, 'pussy' (slang for the vagina), or 'bitch (a female dog)', or 'fag' (being \textbf{g\textbf{ay}}, which is seen as a feminine trait by those who would use that word). In fact, even phrases like: "Stop playing like a girl" or "Stop acting like a girl" connote women as a certain, negative thing.Unless you can provide an alternative explanation to why violence against people who are \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} or mtf individuals is most often conducted by straight men, then I don't understand how Laci's point can be invalid. I've looked into alternative explanations... I have yet to find one. That's why I was hoping you could actually show some research or info to say how Laci is wrong, rather than just dodging the question with a vague response.And again, Laci already offered an explanation as to why these events occur, and the fact that no alternative reasons exist show that you have yet to actually refute what I have said and what she has said.p.s.

The emphasis is on women being thought to be the lesser by society, which according to Laci explains why f2m trans aren't attacked as much, because they would not be lowering themselves, but instead improving themselves.She thinks women are thought to be the lesser because men are bullied by other men/women for acting like girls, but she completely ignores that the opposite also happens, which kinda negates her conclusion that women are seen as lesser.I'm unsure why you're using examples of cases that were clearly not rape to show that none were rape. Here's one: "Gwen Araujo of Newark, California (died October 2002), an American teenage trans \textbf{woman}, was killed by four men, two of whom she had consensual \textbf{sexual} actions with, who beat and strangled her after discovering she was anatomically male"Why is it considered consensual if you use fraud to get it?\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Sexual, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/172 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.163 \\  \hline

What do you mean by the opposite? As in, when women act manly? But that doesn't negate her argument; it only supports it more. It shows that when people move out of their \textbf{gender} roles, others try to enforce them. However, what's more acceptable: a \textbf{woman} wearing pants, or a guy wearing a dress? The fact is, men's \textbf{gender} roles are a lot more enforced than women's \textbf{gender} roles. I have yet to see a \textbf{woman} get made fun of for wearing men's clothes or acting 'manly', but the instances where boys and men get bullied for being 'feminine' is prevalent. So it doesn't really negate her conclusion when the instances are unequal."I'm unsure why you're using examples of cases that were clearly not rape to show that none were rape."Um, what. Stop trying to twist my words, it's immature. However, this might just be your own personal continuous misinterpretation from a lack of insight, so I'll at least justify why I included them: It shows that NOT ALL VIOLENCE AGAINST TRANS INDIVIDUALS IS DUE TO \textbf{SEXUAL} DECEIT. So your argument that 'all violence against trans people is because of deceit, how suspicious' falls apart when you have the majority of examples showing no sexuality being involved at all. So again, how would you explain those instances?"Here's one: "Gwen Araujo of Newark, California (died October 2002), an American teenage trans \textbf{woman}, was killed by four men, two of whom she had consensual \textbf{sexual} actions with, who beat and strangled her after discovering she was anatomically male"...it's still not rape. All she did was deceive them... but how in the world does your twisted mind support beating and strangling someone to death for lying? Your logic is really frightening...Fraud is not equivalent to rape. I don't even know where this logic is coming from. While it might be disturbing to find that you just got a hand job blow job (since I don't see how it could have been anything else that wouldn't reveal biology without the men realizing) from someone who was anatomically male, do you really think that it's a reason to kill someone? If it is... let's hope that no one ever lies to you. Because, you know.

But her argument fails because according to her logic society hates men too.I'm not sure you even support her argument since you've not actually defended it, or even seem to understand what it is.\@Micah MacCallum "Um, what.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small You at the beginning of the video state that \textbf{sexism} must have a societal and power component, and that is somewhat wrong. That level of \textbf{sexism} is "institutional \textbf{sexism}." \textbf{Sexism} by itself is making a judgement or discrimination based solely on \textbf{gender} or \textbf{sex}. To downgrade that mentality from \textbf{sexism} to just a prejudice is pardoning that action as a prejudice is a minor offense and \textbf{sexism} is a major one. Academia is perpetuating the injustice by insisting that the word "\textbf{sexism}" only applies to women.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I think that acknowledging differences in genders shouldn't be called \textbf{sexism}. Telling a man that he can be who he wants to be is like telling a \textbf{woman} that she can grow a uni-brow or a mustache if she wants. She can grow a mustache, but should she? It's the fact that certain characteristics lower your chances of attracting a person you want. The real argument should be that some people attribute wrong things to masculinity (e.g. emotional suppression or the willingness to engage in a physical altercation). IMO, telling people that they can be whoever they want is like telling them that every road leads to the same destination. What if I want to lay on a couch all day, eat potato chips and browse furry sites? If you really care about somebody, then your responsibility is not to tell them that everything they do is okay, but to encourage them to change bad habits and take actions that will lead them into having more happiness and life satisfaction.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Sexism, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/170 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.176 \\  \hline

Its just that over time society has kinda said "Who cares about the dad, as long as there is a \textbf{woman} the child will turn out fine.". Men don't lose custody battles because they can't be nurturing, men lose custody battles because children are considered the \textbf{woman}'s property until they reach the \textbf{age} adulthood.

Regardless of the fact that boy-toys exist verifying the dehumanization of the male \textbf{gender} as well, there's \textbf{nothing} right with seeing anyone as a \textbf{sex} object. The other pressures mentioned were accurate and fine to the male \textbf{gender} but anyone saying that devaluing a person to a \textbf{sex} object or a notch on a bed post is something any moral person faces. Sure everyone wants to have lots of \textbf{sex}, but the idea that  women want it with just their committed partners and men want to have as much \textbf{sex} as possible is bullshit! People have their own morals, and it's not based on genders, but wether or not they want to do the right thing. I've cheated in relationships, but also learned from what I was doing to people who really cared about me. The fact that I'm a guy isn't an excuse to cause problems in my relationship. Before hand, I thought I could just put that up as a reason for me continue what I was doing, but male or female, \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} or straight, anyone can take on that kind of disregard for people. It's hard to relate to men, but just like how I learned to relate to women, it started with myself and how I would react.

And this feels just like one of those things, "You are a man so you can't join us because this is only for women", and there are a TON of things that I have encountered like that, spaces only for women but never an equivalent only for men.I got a little bit carried away, I always do sorry, but my question was and still is, why is it feminism and not equalism?

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small There are sexist standards which affect men that fall outside your narrative of a feminine derivation of causality.  I don't necessarily disagree with your argument, but it should be classified as an abstraction at the very least.  The male daycare worker is a lost career pursuit not because people associate any man as doing that work as \textbf{woman} and therefore lesser, but because any man who chooses this career also has chosen to work with children and is therefore a pedophiliac rapist or \textbf{sex} offender.  This decision isn't relegating him to some societal contrivance of inferior \textbf{woman} status.  It is a statistically, scientifically, and logically unsubstantiated form of prejudice and lapse in risk assessment justified under the guise of a desire to protect children from a non-existent threat.  A man in an abusive relationship is given no channels through which he can leave safely yet, if he is the abuser, is rightfully scorned an ostracized (and/or hopefully made a recipient of rehabilitation for retroactive prevention).  A \textbf{woman} receives far better channels (though in serious need of improvement) for safety and no recompense is made to the victim nor punishment or action taken against the perpetrator.  Who loses in that scenario?  Well, the abused of course, but it's clearly the man who get's screwed over.  The definition of \textbf{sexism} you gave is textbook, but insufficient.  \textbf{Sexism} is the lapse in reasoning which purports a link between any trait(s) and the X and Y chromosomes which have not been sufficiently demonstrated, either empirically or otherwise, to exist.  That's all.  I'm not wholly convinced that the lens you posit as being the soul arbiter of sexist idiosyncrasies isn't a farce because it seems like you've set an arbitrary perspective from an invalid presupposition.  That being said, if you can justify your reasoning I would gladly change my mind.  I want to hold the opinion that makes the most sense, not think I'm right and miss a flaw in my reasoning.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Sex, Sexism, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}6/327 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.835 \\  \hline

I played basket ball with my friends and I work on cars, metal work, and other "manly" things.

It's kind of like how the Civil Rights Movement focused on the discrimination against \textbf{black} people - thereby creating racial equality. Now you might not agree with the sentiment that women are more oppressed than men in modern-day society.

It's true that we may be slanted toward certain attractions due to the way we adapted through evolution, but human personalities and the way we choose our partners are far more complex than just our base instincts, and to say these things apply to all women most likely means you've drawn an over-simplified and biased conclusion from whatever studies you've supposedly read. Just because evolution may have favored certain traits back when we were knuckle-dragging cavemen, doesn't mean every single individual living now has or favors those traits. In case you didn't notice, human males are no longer required to fight to the death with other males in order to gain the right to breed with a female like some other animal species. Males and females freely choose each other based on individual tastes, which results in varied offspring with various different personality types. Physical prowess and aggression are no longer the single determining factor in whether or not someone breeds, nor even is the ability to provide, as plenty of women have children with dead-beat fathers. Lots of women also stick with their boyfriends/husbands and don't cheat after they lose their job. Life isn't a TV sitcom, it's more complex than that. People are individuals, women don't all want the same things, any more than all men always want the same things. Lots of women have said that that kind of man ISN'T what they want.

Additionally, these negative traits are actually human traits, not \textbf{gender} traits, as any human is capable of being irrational, weak and incompetent regardless of \textbf{gender} or \textbf{sex}.Toxic masculinity, on the other hand, differs in that behaviors destructive to oneself and others are encouraged simply for the sake of maintaining a specific interpretation of masculinity. The "toxic" nature of femininity exists to force the feminine \textbf{gender} to be subservient to the masculine \textbf{gender}. The toxic nature of masculinity exists to destroy all other versions of masculinity that are considered "wrong."So... no, they are not the same and you are committing a fallacy of false equivalence. Neither \textbf{gender} ideal need contain a value judgment; they can both exist simply as descriptors of personality and preference. However, that's not the world we live in.

This particular flavor of the masculine \textbf{gender} paradigm violently suppresses all other forms of masculinity and all forms of empowering femininity.It is a problem because it is destructive, both externally and internally. There isn't an externally destructive form of femininity. I don't even know what that would look like. It's just Not a Thing. There are self-destructive forms of femininity, sure: regressive \textbf{gender} paradigms that reduce anyone with certain qualities deemed "feminine" as lesser beings.Your example makes no sense, unless you believe that all feminine people are women, which is completely untrue as there are plenty of feminine men, masculine women and people who are neither and both. \textbf{Gender} and \textbf{sex} are not the same thing. Women who act in the manner you're speaking of have internalized the same toxic masculinity that creates the men they're trying to "get."Put simply, toxic masculinity demands that boys grow up to be men that act in accordance to its singular view of what masculinity should be. Toxic masculinity also demands girls grow up to desire a man that act in accordance to its singular view of what masculinity should be. It has to, or else girls may grow up into women who desire a different interpretation of masculinity and that runs contrary to its goal of suppressing and eliminating everything that is not exactly like itself.

Yet women can do it to. We all want to protect those we love, yet we don't have to walk around in bear suits all the time to prove it. Though some feel a need to within their dangerous environments so as to maintain an air of dominance and power to keep the jerks at bay.

If a \textbf{woman} is not aware of her perpetual victimhood, we will shame her into admitting it, since ours is the only way to think.7.   We decry \textbf{sexism}, but value paternalism.8.   We advocate for equality and social justice, as long as everyone realizes that we are more important than anyone else.9.   We are fully-actualized, independent human beings who do not ever need to take responsibility for our own actions.10. We are creatures of reason, yet we find disagreement too 'triggering' to deal with. The modern/extreme feminism is vastly unfair to men, while also denigrating the accomplishments of independent, free-thinking women. While I agree that women have yet to reach their full potential in many areas, and while I don't object to reasonable protection, legislation, and support, the demands I hear from these types of feminists are neither reasonable nor rational. In fact, the entire movement seems focused on perpetuating the illusion of great disadvantage so as to profit those women who have poured their life's efforts into an ideology that doesn't hold up to scrutiny. In sum, these are the arguments I hear that these feminists make, and as a human being who strives to live by the light of reason, I cannot possibly accept them.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Sexism, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/379 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.528 \\  \hline

Hard working, being a leader, being stoic, assertiveness, etc etc.  Why would we not try to instil this into men?  The proof is in the pudding.  Put 50 guys in a room with those traits and put 50 guys in room with the opposite of those traits and add up their achievements.  See what you get.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Dumb & \cellcolor{green!27}Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}1/217 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.461 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Inter and Intra-sexual oppression is a continuing issue. Intra, meaning within the same \textbf{sex},  however is a much more difficult issue to change. When talking about women being oppressed by men statistics and such are much easier to gather. However when talking about women oppressing women it is a much harder conflict.For example, there are women out there who believe in spite of everything that they have gained true equality, be it economical or social. These women can use their belief to enforce anti-feminist ideology. I know I often see women on facebook standing against feminism in one way or another.Another example is the belief that women have equality in the work place. This is often backed up with examples of successful women. Often famous such as Hilary Clinton, Margaret Thatcher or Oprah. However what these examples ignore is the continued issues women face. The fact that statistically it is still an anomaly to be a successful \textbf{woman}. The fact that success for the individual does not mean success for the \textbf{Gender}.In the  Intrasexual relationships between males the lad culture is designed to enforce a strict binary norm. It is self replicating and designed in such a way that makes it difficult to combat the negitive effects. Such a culture is oppressive to all, including those who are within it. For while they may not be aware of it it is designed to prevent them from being able to explore themselves. It enforces a binary and if you do not hit that binary exact you are X Y and Z.A contemporary example of something \textbf{witch} continues Intrasexual opression amogst the female \textbf{gender} is the recent song "All about the bass" which implies that \textbf{fat} is a natural state and \textbf{skinny} is not. While it could be viewed as positive it is actually shaming \textbf{skinny} models/women and implying their bodies are wrong. This us and them mentality is often what drives opression. Be it \textbf{Gender}, \textbf{Race}, or other.I personally believe it is the binary that causes it. The Us and Them mentality, two sides of a coin. A lot of the time it can only be overcome by making everyone realise that there is no coin. I like to view it as a a sphere. Everyone lands somewhere on it but it all leads back around.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Redstockings, a radical feminist group founded in the late sixties. They had a nasty streak of man-hating \textbf{g\textbf{ay}}-bashing and it wasn't incidental, it flowed from their basic premises. Here A quote from Carol Hanisch where she explicitly enunciates the \textbf{homophobic} claim that male homosexuality and male separatism are \textbf{misogynist}.  'Men's liberationists always bring up ‘confronting their own feelings about men' by which they mean homosexuality. Male homosexuality is an extension of the reactionary club (meaning both group and weapon). The growth of \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} liberation carries contempt for women to the ultimate: total segregation. The desire of men to ‘explore their homosexuality' really means encouraging the possibility of homosexuality as a reaction against feminist demands.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Rufus Brown You can absolutely identify as a feminist and still fight for all sides (male, female, \textbf{gender} nonconforming, bigender, etc.) through feminism, since feminism promotes the political, economic, and social equality of the sexes. Egalitarianism and feminism are not mutually exclusive, but they are very distinct. Egalitarianism is a political philosophy of how things should be without much grounding in how things are or have been. Feminism is a social theory and movement which acknowledges histories of oppressions which place women (and people seen as "non-men") in the position of second class citizens through \textbf{gender} binaries which negatively impact all genders. Unlike Egalitarianism, feminism acknowledges the intersections between \textbf{sexism} and \textbf{racism}, \textbf{classism}, \textbf{homophobia}, transphobia etc. Also, feminism is a process which is constantly being built and molded in our hands and in our voices.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small In my culture, Holland, it's much more about responsibility. Perhaps to the point that men are expected to be responsible for all aspects of their life, even if they're down on their luck or hurt. Their responsibility, hands off.When it's a \textbf{woman}, that responsibility might be denied them or at the very least, they are instantly offered help or help is imposed upon them. And they're a bitch when they deny help being given.That's what I see is happening, anyway. When I offer help to men, they can react with embarassment. When I offer to help women, they might be impassive. But I never see it the other way around.And both can be hostile (which is culturally considered bitchy when it's a \textbf{woman}) or grateful (which is what you hope they'll be). On the other hand, if the \textbf{woman} is grateful towards a man, this may immediately validate or constitute a flirt.I also do not recognize myself at all in the statement that being emotional is considered feminine. If I get emotional, people consider that threateningly masculine and tell me to calm down, like they're afraid of me.More over, in my culture, there is certainly no 'one version' of being a man. Perhaps that's true in American macho-culture, but in Holland, machos are seen as thugs prone to violence and are people who ought to be avoided. It's more of a subculture here.Finally, I've never heard of \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} men being demonized for being feminine. They are ridiculed for it, but it is their \textbf{sexual} life that is demonized. It's \textbf{nothing} to do with it being 'too much like girls' from what I am able to see here in Holland. We have a bible-belt here too with people believing that being \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} is an abomination, but not because they'd be more feminine, but rather because of what they might want from you or not want from you.It is threatening to heterosexual women, because they are not responsive towards their love and attention ("why are they pretending to be \textbf{g\textbf{ay}}? Every man must want \textbf{sex} with women all the time. They must have an agenda"). It is threatening to heterosexual men, because they think that \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} men are acting more feminine in order to commit "abominable" \textbf{sex} with them.I'm a big fan of you, Laci, but I feel like you're making statements as though they are factual. People in Holland often define their stance on \textbf{gender} issues by what their American idols preach about American culture, without paying attention to what the actual Dutch culture is right now.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gay, Gender, Nothing, Sex, Sexual, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Gender - General, Sexual Identity - General, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality & \cellcolor{green!5}16/434 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.687 \\  \hline

That our society and media these days do say that to be the man every \textbf{woman} wants or everyone looks up to you need to be this or that, this goes the same way for females too.

The truth is \textbf{nothing} is wrong with being any of those things. If you're not some or any of those attributes that's fine too but you can't just sit there and say what should happen with how men grow up especially not being a man yourself, your outside bias is slightly annoying to hear. Of course I felt pressured to be more socially acceptable in certain areas of my life growing up however, my choices on each situation was the sole cause of what defined me as a person. Overcoming the pressure to smoke or drink, do drugs, play certain sports or any of that other crap helped mold me into who I am. Without social choices (even \textbf{gender} specific choices) I wouldn't be who I am today. Now I can't say whether its great or bad but there's \textbf{nothing} about me that I would change to fit anyone else's idea of socially acceptable despite people like you sitting here telling everyone else that what they are doing is wrong because it doesn't meet your definition of socially acceptable. \textbf{Sexism} isn't \textbf{black} and white like you're trying to depict it is in this video, there are always gray areas.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Gender, Nothing, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}5/215 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.326 \\  \hline

Which I find bothersome because it is \textbf{sexism} against men. They are saying "You are a man, therefore you are unfit to be a parent because men are incapable of childcare" That's the mentality in custody court, but somehow it's sexist to girls not men.

I might be better if she didn't bring up the \textbf{sexism} about women at all.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@mrwho995 I see where you're coming from and what you're trying to say, but I'm quite certain that you're wrong.You can't deny that a few of the most \textbf{common} insults used on guys when one wants to wound them are ones that somehow link them to women, or female genitalia. I'm thinking about the use of  "\textbf{pussy}" (also "cunt" and "twat"), "bitch", or just flat-out a "girl" on those who either identify as male or are in any way expected to conform to stereotypically male \textbf{gender} roles, when their behavior somehow doesn't match what is expected from them based on their \textbf{gender} or their \textbf{sex}. Things like "you throw/run like a girl" used as motivation by coaches, "boys don't cry (as an extension, "what are you, a girl?" and its variants)" used to condition kids to repress their emotions, or implying that the person is on their period even if they don't have one when their behavior is "irrational" or, in other words, "bitchy".You know, it's almost as if being likened to a \textbf{woman} was the ultimate insult. Almost as if it was a brand of \textbf{misogyny} that aims to demonize and repress what is considered stereotypically feminine in men.Almost as if what Laci said was completely right.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Common, Gender, Misogyny, Sex, Woman, pussy & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General, Nationality - Chinese, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}7/211 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.318 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@InvincibleRodentBy that token, is calling someone a dick, or dick head, also a very \textbf{common} insult, misandric? Is calling someone an asshole misanthropic? \textbf{Gender} doesn't even come into those insults most of the time. I'm pretty \textbf{gender} neutral when it comes to my insults, personally.When you approach any given situation under the bias of the presupposition of feminism, regardless of its validity, you're going to make all your observations based on this belief. And by doing this, even when you make a video about how men suffer from \textbf{sexism}, it still turns around to be how it's still all about the girls, and it's still all the fault of masculinity/patriarchy/men. It''s an argument that's simply lacking in nuance.Both genders face pressures to not be like the opposite (and of course trans and others in the spectrum have it much worse). Maybe it's more pronounced in males than females, but it's still counterproductive and tiring for any issue men face to be turned around to still be their fault, and still be about women. One of my main problems with feminism is its lacking on nuance and its focus on a restrictive and overbearing narrative that all social commentary must be constructed around.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Common, Gender, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}4/205 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.951 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I think the problem that \@mrwho995 (and myself) see with the video is that rather than address the pressures against men as "the stereotype to be strong and manly", she address it as "the stereotype to be not-womanly".  Essentially Laci is saying that if men didn't belittle \textbf{woman} in the first place, then things like crying or sensitivity wouldn't be considered insulting.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Channing Julien The thing is though, she was pointing out that many of our \textbf{gender} issues stem from comparing ourselves to women, which she is not wrong about.One way prep-talk guys tend to use on other guys to get them through something physical is by calling them a girl or girl terms, Sometimes even girls do it to themselves because the idea of a girl is the idea of weak.We also should just be happy that someone finally wants to open up dialog about the issues the male \textbf{gender} are faced with, the entire Feminism movement has been so highly female \textbf{gender} based that we even made the term Meninism to open out dialog for Male equality.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/119 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.521 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Channing Julien  Yeah the reality is that men are stigmatized for being perceived as not manly, not that they are being perceived as women.  There is some intersection between the two but ultimately they are two entirely different sets of social pressures.  Saying the pressure of \textbf{gender} roles that men experience is just a reflection of \textbf{misogyny} is completely inaccurate, and just reeks of trying reshape reality to fit one's preconceived ideological notions.  I also think that claiming that the persecution trans people face is just an extension of \textbf{misogyny} is transphobic.  Basically they're saying that everything has to be centered around the experiences of cis women.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender, Misogyny & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/107 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.804 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Justice Bennett I never said I held those views. I was responding to remarks made by Laci, where she said "Many of the pressures boys face come down to defining themselves against women". In saying that, she has defined male \textbf{sexism} as relative to female \textbf{sexism}, i.e.. if society wasn't sexist towards \textbf{woman}, remarks like "you throw like a girl" wouldn't be considered insulting. That is my point when I stated how Laci addressed male \textbf{sexism} in such a way as to define it as 'how no to be perceived as feminine', rather than 'how to be perceived as masculine'.And again, I completely agree that \textbf{sexism} towards men and \textbf{woman} are separate social pressure.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small +mrwho995Well, I can certainly see where you're coming from. It's exciting to see the portions of feminism that address male issues (which can sometimes be rare), and I can understand disappointment to see so many women's issues addressed. But the video wasn't titled 'how we specifically discriminate against men in a society' but how \textbf{sexism} negatively impacts those we often dismiss as privileged. There seem to be many commenters complaining that men's issues and women's issues are separate and should be discussed in exclusion. But that's a little ludicrous, don't you think? Feminism is about correcting inequalities between genders. Inequality means that all sides are out of balance, regardless of which \textbf{gender} is 'benefiting' or suffering. This video was about how \textbf{sexism} negatively impacts men, and that includes expectations and discrimination of all sides. The point was that \textbf{misogyny} can have actually have a negative impact on men, who are so commonly perceived as the beneficiaries in that department. Perhaps she could also have cited examples of masculinity represented as an insult when used to describe women, but I think it was left implied because she was trying to emphasize how men are suffering. Either way, it's definitely not about pitting people against each other or blaming one \textbf{gender}. It's about accepting blame as a society (men, women, trans folk and anyone else) who have been accepting these notions for so long, so that the issues can be solved someday.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender, Misogyny, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}5/241 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.075 \\  \hline

And I don't buy the "nature made men stronger" argument as a reason for the current \textbf{gender} gaps in employment. Yeah, the bell curve for men's physical abilities will be slightly higher than that of women's, but how do you apply that theory when very few jobs are so physically demanding anymore? Women are just fine as diplomats, and government officials, and CEOs. And you can't really say that women are the exception when it came to world-changing roles when there are so many of them. Minority is a word that can be used, but there's far too many of them to say that they are an exception. What about Katherine of England? Queen Victoria? Mother Teresa? Florence Nightengale? Susan B. Anthony? Rosa Parks? Dorothy Hodgkin? Margaret Thatcher? Anne Frank? Wangari Maathai? Hatshepsut? Cleopatra? Galla Placidia?

How many more women didn't get credit for what they did? Men didn't make this world on their own.

So I'm not sure what you men-were-superman-and-women-made-the-babies argument you want me to take seriously. The entire point of this video is that evolutionary ability doesn't matter anymore and that both men and women should be able to do whatever the hell they want without having to worry about cultural pressures. We make our culture today. We're not obligated to keep up this inequality because "it used to be that way" or it's always been that way.But even if men are virtually always stronger than women, what kinds of riskier jobs require that extra super strength you mention? Last I checked, a vast majority of manual labor jobs where that extra strength is helpful are actually rather low paying (except MAYBE crab fishing in Alaska). Riskier behavior in a business setting doesn't mean higher pay as consistently as what we see; if it did pay off that frequently, then it wouldn't be very risky. But that still doesn't explain why boys are told to "\textbf{buck} up" and "stop crying" etc. when they are younger. Men are perfectly capable of dancing, nursing, and sewing just like how women are perfectly capable of leading companies, serving in government positions, and engineering. Again, THAT is the entire point of this video. That men ARE capable of these things. They don't have to be hardcore fighters, or macho alpha males. And please, if you want to be taken seriously, let's avoid rebuttals like "GFY" I'm a big girl over here, and I can handle reading the word "fuck."\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Buck, Race & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/331 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.604 \\  \hline

Society exists to help each other out and you're telling people to take care of the problem themselves when they actually can't. When people attack you and beat you for being unmanly, there isn't much you can do about it. You ask for help and then people tell you to suck it up. You express yourself and you get called a \textbf{fag}. You dress and groom yourself in ways that aren't considered manly and people tell you that's not how you're supposed to act. You get called \textbf{weird} for it, you get called other negative names, people constantly try to change who you are. Every single day you experience this relentlessly.

You can't avoid everyone forever, unless you win the lottery and become a hermit. I know I can't. I know most people can't. Why is it that you deny this issue that many people have admitted to experiencing? You should be asking yourself this question. To me, what you've written, basically sounds like "This isn't my problem and I don't want to deal with it and shame on you for telling me about this issue and asking me to help deal with it". The reality is that this is everyone's problem. It's a social issue. It's a real issue. It's an issue that needs everyone to participate in solving. And your excuse to not participate is, and i'm paraphrasing you, "I've never experienced this and no one around me has said they have" and "society has already fixed this issue in a short time". As I have said, just because you haven't experienced it doesn't mean it doesn't exist and that society has fixed this issue.

Unless you have no contact with society, you are probably sexist in some way shape or form, even if you are the most hard-core believer in \textbf{gender} equality, societal norms are powerful things, and there have been powerful studies like the Stanford Prison experiment and the Milgram experiment to show this. Fighting for \textbf{gender} equality is just as much about fighting the \textbf{gender} inequality within as much as it is about fighting the \textbf{gender} inequality outside, in fact all equality movements are just as much about fighting internal inequality as much as external inequality. I think that's why people try and make the distinction between egalitarianism and feminism, not only because identifying as a feminist shows a focus and understanding of the minutia of \textbf{gender} inequality, but also a commitment to identifying how you are sexist, how the \textbf{patriarchy} effects you, and what you do in relation to \textbf{gender}, and an awareness that you are not immune.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender, Patriarchy & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}7/203 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.448 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Borg Warner Was it ever claimed in the video that men never suffer \textbf{sexism} at the hands of women?Actually, Laci gave a few extremely relevant examples of how stereotypical \textbf{gender} roles do frequently harm men - one of the most damaging of all being the way men are often marginalized in the role of caregiver to their own children. In most countries, the assumption that the mother was always the most appropriate "natural nurturer" has led to decades of divorced or separated men being basically excluded from raising their children to the point of it being legally enshrined. Of course, this is being overturned in most places - but I've personally known several men who, having divorced or otherwise left (sometimes really awful) relationships to have lost all contact with their kids because their ex was given full custody by default. One of my uncles, himself a lawyer, divorced his first wife when he discovered she was a "sneaky" alcoholic, among other things. Their younger child was born with Fetal \textbf{Alcohol} Syndrome. Despite this, the Family Court still gave custody to his ex-wife who in turn moved to the other side of the country with her new boyfriend. Obviously, this made seeing his own children each second weekend as ordered impossible, but the Court's decision was upheld on 2 appeals. This was only about 20 years ago.It is still generally assumed in the Legal system where I live that a child will always be "best off" in the care of their biological mother. [Even though it isn't officially the position of the Court, it's hard to undo ingrained cultural bias.] I have a close friend who remains trapped in a miserable marriage "for the sake of his daughter" as he is terrified her mentally unstable mother will somehow gain custody. I've tried to explain that the fact she has extreme Borderline Personality Disorder \& self harms in order to manipulate people would almost certainly weigh heavily against her NOW - but the fear remains.I would call that evidence of the tragic legacy of sexist \textbf{gender} roles.

Even today, men from various cultures wear robes, dress-like shirts, or skirt-like clothes, but \textbf{nobody} sees those clothes as making them less masculine or less of a man. You don't have to look to history to find examples of this type of dress, but looking to history can remind us that dress changes frequently, so why should we care so much.

If you believe speaking up about something is the same as shackling another person, then why is it you think it's okay for some people to speak up (about men's dress choices) but not okay for other people to speak up (about why it's not right to mock other people's dress choices)? Isn't telling someone you don't like what they are wearing the same thing as FORCING that person to change their standards of dress?So, you're right, \textbf{nobody} can FORCE anybody to change their standards and opinions, but we CAN challenge people who bully others for dress choices and remind them how easy it is to be quiet about something which is hurting no one. Depending on how hateful their language is or if they are actually hurting or bullying someone, we can also call them out for that hate speech or harrassment under the law.Just as we can't FORCE anybody to keep their mouths shut and change their stance, you can't FORCE anybody to not respond to comments which are unneccessary, discriminatory, and judgemental of a person's individual expression and identity.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nobody & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!27}1/247 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.405 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small You glazed over (what I think is) the most important part of \textbf{sexual} inequality at the moment, which is where men are expected to see women as objects/goals.

If men weren't 'expected' to be dominant and take the lead, have pressure forced upon them for NOT having \textbf{sex} at any opportunity and bullied for not trying it on with any girl, the extreme cases which include \textbf{sexual} abuse and rape would reduce drastically.I just feel the world of equality is aimed at just telling men what they should and shouldn't do to each other, but the real goal should be to stop men from pressuring other men into \textbf{sexual} encounters.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small It's an issue I try to bring up with most feminists as although obviously there is the chance that making men aware of what is right and wrong can make some realise their problems, it's not always a long term solution.Growing up as a guy is a lot harder than people consider as you are not only forced by peers to ask girls out on dates and such, but you are shunned if you don't. Making a long lasting feeling of having to approach as many women as possible to attempt to get any kind of positive reinforcement.With the growing positivity towards homosexuality, you can see the divide between heterosexual approaches and \textbf{homosexual} approaches towards people they are attracted to. Because the issues I mentioned are heterosexual, you can see that the \textbf{homosexual} community actually has a very small \textbf{sexual} harassment percentage because of the lack of dominance forced into our younger brains towards homosexuality.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Homosexual, Sexual & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General, Sexual Identity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/157 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.911 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@MATTGRAYY A lot of feminists understand that in order to really make a difference we need to change the way we treat and teach both girls and boys. So, again, what you were saying was something that I've long been aware of as a major issue, I just hadn't fully connected the dots to my own emotional struggle yet. So I'm really glad your comment could help me make the leap from understanding to empathizing, as empathy is a core part of my feminism that I try to continue building.That said, your last paragraph was really strange to me. Not only do I feel like the foundation of your argument (that \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} guys don't touch women as much as straight dudes because \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} guys aren't taught to act that way or see women that way) is not so true, but I also find that the initial assumption (that \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} men just aren't as sexist or touchy with women) to not be true either. There actually is a huge problem of \textbf{sexual} harassment in the \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} community (between men and women and men and men-- even women and women, though much less so). The only reasons advances in most public spaces are less \textbf{common} is because of the risk of a violent response since the act of street harassment between men-to-men (or women-to-women) would out the harasser.History might arguably have an impact, though not in the way you proposed. Historically, making sure the other person was on board helped keep queers closeted and safe from public ridicule, or worse. That is, clear consent and mutual trust = survival during those times in which being publicly \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} could be a death sentence. Also, discussions about consent expanded in the \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} community during the AIDS crisis of the 80s.That said, quite a few \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} men still feel like it's acceptable to touch women or comment about their bodies. Why? Because not only do these men still come from a legacy of being able to see women as objects for the male gaze, but also because the femininity that is more embraced in \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} spaces makes some of these men feel like they are a male authority on femaleness. Plus it's not \textbf{sexual} harassment if they aren't actually attracted to you, right? (Wrong.)Women are also guilty of feeling like they can touch \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} guys for basically the same sexist reasons: \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} guys are kinda feminine, right? and that's how you treat a \textbf{woman}, right? (Wrong.) Oh, and it's not \textbf{sexual} if you're not attracted to them, right? (Wrong.)Hope that all makes sense.

They are right that they get ousted, but by their own doing.. most men (whether they like it or not) don't want to fight for custody.. so it's only unfair by the choice that most men make.. not really the system.....The same reason why I argue with Feminists about the "Pay Gap" because here again.. it's by the choices of what most women make that this even exists... so to my point why I bring up the one sided view.Whenever rape, domestic violence and objectification is brought up, It is usually focused on the women and the men are left out of the conversation.
