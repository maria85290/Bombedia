  \cellcolor{green!27}\small i can't find a single positive comment here and it makes me sad, tbh. i'm a female gamer. i think this talk tackles some important issues pretty well. also, guys out there? how would you feel if all but two popular video game protagonists (i'm counting out those whose \textbf{gender} you can choose obviously because they can belong to either of these groups that way) were women? wouldn't you think "the games are good, but it would be real nice if they put some guys in there, too"? because the only two female protagonists i can recall are lara croft and aloy. now you count the male protagonists you can name.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/111 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.901 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small His comment of "when somthing wants  to be considered a art form, it has to be looked at through the prism of politics, \textbf{race} snd \textbf{gender}" is complete tripe and shows he doesn't understand the fundementals of art. Art is about the expression and vsion of the artist themselves with the freedom to create their art the way they want  . This talk shows you don't care about video games as an art form because you want to dictate to the artist what they can or can not make and just because you don't like something it does not make it  wrong and does not mean it needs to be changed. To use this persons logic on other art forms the world would have alot less books, movies and music.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender, Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/130 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.538 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The argument that video games aren't art has been played over and over for various things in the past that today are considered art. People used to think that films weren't art, photography wasn't art. Those \textbf{old} people are the same iteration of those who would resist something as art because that was the thinking then. When they die, video games would be held in high regard as an artform because people consider it as one as it was with films and photography. Take an art class because there are many types of expression in art from the realistic to satirical.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}1/101 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.99 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Poor attempts at humor, cherry picking examples, talking about video games when he clearly has no clue on the premise of gaming, and misrepresenting most arguments are why you are humorless and missed the mark on all your talking points. At several points throughout the video he made points about the discrimination that women face and how they are portrayed while completely (ignorantly) missing the hyperbolic satirical humor that is the stereotypes that EVERY CHARECTER HAS. Trever is a meth smoking \textbf{hillbilly}. Michael is a neurotic manchild who cant control himself. Franklin is a gangster caught between the streets and legitimacy.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Few points here, firstly, if you play Farmsville or Candy Crush, you're not a gamer, period. Playing some chinsey ass mobile device game in a waiting room, doesn't make you a gamer. Gamers play real games, gamers are passionate about real games. You cant say that Granny, sitting out back collecting virtual livestock and pestering her Facebook friends to get plots of virtual land next to her, is a gamer. You cant, because it isn't a video game. Secondly, women who are gamers and play actual games aren't out there throwing a fit because they cant play as a female character in GTA. They play GTA so they can play as the dude on the box, who goes around and does bad things to other virtual beings in that virtual city. It's GTA, it's never been about a female character being the focus, and most likely, never will, ever. Video games with female leads? Laura Croft was featured in a slew of games where she was basically Indiana Jones. KOTOR, you could create a female character to play as. \textbf{Elder} Scrolls, you can play as a female character and slay dragons in Skyrim. As for Zelda, because sweet buttery baby Jesus this pleb needs to be sorted out on her. She doesn't run around as Sheik fighting anyone. She is in disguise and helps Link, the hero, by telling him where to go, giving hints and clues. Maybe if this poorly dressed hipster played video games he'd know a thing or two about them. No idea what basement thrift store he crawled out of but he is best just slithering back into it. \textbf{Nothing} he said is accurate, it's just lies and misrepresentation of data.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Elder, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}2/285 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.702 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Do you even play any games? There are so many games with good female protagonists and just good female characters in general. Majority of gamers that are male are not against Females who play games quite the opposite alot of guys say they want more Female gamers. That study you showed is incorrect it includes casual by the logic of that study my Mum is a gamer because she plays slot machines on facebook. My sister plays mobile games even she says she is not a gamer.This is the problem, majority of gamers (Including actual Female gamers) get annoyed because this is just false information you are trying to spread for your own stupid agenda. I showed this on PSN to a bunch of other Females on my list everyone of them replied something like... Wow is this guy retarded? My favorite was "Thank god we have this white knight to save us from all evil gamers!". See you treat \textbf{Woman} that actually play games like they don't understand and you do even though you obviously don't play games and for some reason you think you have more knowledge of this than actual Females who play games, you don't though you just sound like a arrogant prick.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/208 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.481 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The problem is:1) You didn't do real research, or anyone you used as a reference/example.2) Defending a game critic who put their ideologies and political beliefs into their JOB.3) Saying GTA 5 is sexist because you have an option to kill women even though you can kill literally EVERYONE. Men, women, whites, blacks, hispanics, gays, crossdressers, etc.So why is it a problem when you can kill everyone equally! Well... actually you can't, BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO KILL MANY, MANY, MANY, MEN TO PROGRESS IN THE GAME!Also it's fucking satire on American culture and stereotypes...4) If there was either no female characters or one or two of the playable characters were female I bet you would complain because A: There's no females! WTF YOU CIS WHITE MALE! Or B: This game has female characters that are bad people! You can't do that it's offensive!Also you contradict yourself multiple times! Why does \textbf{gender}, \textbf{race}, or sexuality matter? And if you want true equality, then argue about not having the draft for females, or is that not what  you meant by "equal?" Also your statistic is shit because there IS a difference between gamers like us and people who just play mobile games. Also we aren't stopping women from playing games are getting jobs in gaming, so please stop creating dragons to slay.I mean, I'm a bisexual guy and I don't give two shits who I play as in games, and I don't care if I get "represented" because it doesn't matter!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender, Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/257 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.778 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small This is probably one of the most disingenuous talks I have seen.So there was a petition to get a reviewer fired...?

Look at the vitriol Jim Sterling got when he reviewed Breath of the Wild...And there was a petition to get Caroline fired from GameSpot?A petition that had 69 supporters which constitutes 0.01 of the people who watched the review.... Well call the equality police because that is sure proof of the incredible hatred of women infesting gaming... or... something...And GTA 5 - a game series that has always been satirical in nature using the most exaggerated stereotypes - where you play as 3 criminals of more than questionable morality (one of which is actually a complete \textbf{psycho}), and they are never portrayed as anything but that is proof of.... ahhh.... just a minute... eeehhh... something...Wow, I'm surprised Paul didn't get a major injury from stretching so much...\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender, Psycho & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}2/176 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.136 \\  \hline

Are we also going to talk about when one of the characters is actually sexist, we can laugh because he's insane, and the world of GTAV isn't a representation of the real world, are we going to talk about the scene where to torture an innocent man within an inch of his life, no, because it's fine when it's a man.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/106 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.943 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small People these days... just because I'm a male, and I play video-games, I am Sexist? Does this guy, even do research or is this TED Talk really just biased to please some \textbf{fat} feminists? Also, we gamers, DO discriminate. There are casual gamers, you know, your mom who is Town Hall 3 in Clash Of Clans which she plays on her iPhone 6. There are hardcore gamers, who base their career on gaming itself. They are NOT the same even though they share the word "Gamer" on themselves. See just because we don't have a Female Lead in our game, doesn't make the game sexist. Games, at least most of them, are based on fictional stories. Fiction doesn't care if some \textbf{fat} feminist says that we need a Female Lead. It's the team who created the game who gets to decide if the game needs one or not. If you think that a game should have a Female lead JUST FOR THE SAKE OF IT, you're not a feminist fighting for equality, you're fighting for INEQUALITY and you are scared of being judged.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Fat & \cellcolor{green!27}Physical Identity - Physical Features & \cellcolor{green!27}2/183 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.093 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small you do know carolynn was wrong not because she is a female and you suggesting that gamers are mad because of her feminist ideals is fairly sexist in itself. her review was bad because she put her own beliefs ahead of the games intent which was to show the polar ends of americana throughthe scope of satire. the fact that you can't see that is quite possibly why your humor is so horrid in this video. The 3 men that you say are portrayed in this game as being sexist is completely blinding, these men are not being held up as a high moral figure. if they had one \textbf{woman} as one of these characters you would have still cried sexist because they would have treated her as an immoral person. you can't have it both ways. the reason they were men is because when a man is played as a degenerate in games no one care, but god forbid if it was a female. this is not feminism or equality of the sexes it is you trying to make a flawed point that originated from a flawd review. you need to stop calling out \textbf{sexism} when you can't even see it for when it isn't there.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Sexism, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/207 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.966 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I think GTA would be awesome with some female leads. I don't think those characters should be full of "grace" as the man in the video stated they might be. In fact, the characters in GTA are SUPPOSED to be the most terrible, awful people you have ever heard of. If a female character is to be introduced into such a series, she needs to be just as awful as the other characters, or it would seem out of place. As far as the "boys only club" I completely agree that most males in games completely jump on any chance to bash women that are in the same games as them, just for them being women. In truth, any easy target on the internet is going to get that treatment though. And the only reason I say "easy target" is because females that profess their \textbf{gender} in online games are very rare indeed. I think it would go a really long way if everyone was more honest about who they really are, just to show how much more the gap really has been bridged. Men "boys" shouldn't be bashing females just because they're playing the same game. Nor should females ever feel like they should have to hide their identity to avoid being berated during gaming. I'm just saying I think honesty would help a lot. Make it more clear that women do really play these games and they're not going anywhere just because some people don't like it!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/249 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.402 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I honestly feel like all these Misogyny/Racism/Xenophobic talks always make assumptions and then continue to make more assumptions from there, it just goes down a rabbit hole. A game like GTA V is far too nuanced and has far too much content within itself for it to be broken down within 3 minutes, which is how much he seems to care to dedicating any explanation of the game itself, whether it be details about characters, plot events, game-play mechanics. Does anyone else notice that? To me that is the biggest failure here, as the audience is completely naive to the game and this Paul guy takes advantage of that to express his opinion as if it is fact. It's honestly creepy to me. There is SUCH little attention given to actually detailing the game and there is never a consideration of another point of view. These topics are never put into context properly, instead they always build this simplistic antagonist which in this case an incredibly basic and stubborn gamer that is assumed to be misogynistic meaning that any mention of \textbf{gender} or content in the game that deals with a \textbf{woman} is automatically sexist. The narrative builds in such a binary "us against them" fashion every damn time as a result. If you want an example of this just watch 5:48 where the comment says "putting this \textbf{woman} up to reviewing this game". The guy stops for a moment at \textbf{woman} and says "hmm, interesting". Are you kidding? There is \textbf{nothing} projected about \textbf{gender} anywhere else in the comment so he is just using the pronoun. For heaven's sake he even uses "\textbf{woman}", and not any other female pronoun like "girl, so what is the deal here? It's ironic because I feel like that is sexist.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender, Nothing, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}7/297 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.357 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small is this guy an idiot? as a white male where do i go to complain about all the general harassment i see in gaming every day? im certainly not female... instead of being so disingenuous and claiming a general minority, (if very vocal) population of trolls who harass anyone with ANY identifiable trait, to be the sole problem of females, and an example of \textbf{sexism} in the community, they could be speaking out against acting like an ass in general. but no that doesnt fit their socially profitable issue mongering... \textbf{Sexism} is real, but its not constantly the reason for everything bad in the world. and the place its LEAST the problem, is in gaming... id bet my life on it.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Sexism & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/121 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.653 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Ok, here is the deal. When you are making a fictional story and that story portrays hardened and violent criminals, majority of those are male. And since part of the game is all about that Gangsta lifestyle it tries to show you what a gangster thinks like.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small 2:00 Oh, there are barely any females in the mix of archetypes? Maybe if you didn't yell at developers for being sexist every time they portrayed females in a way you find "derogatory" or "insulting", they would be a bit more willing to introduce female characters.2:34 One Internet search of "47 of gamers are women?" shows that this statistic is being completely skewed by counting smartphone games. If you want to stereotype all gamers to that South park picture in slideshow, then do that. Don't be misleading and include smartphone games in your statistics.2:54 The word girl translates as vulnerable to you? ...I'm just gonna leave it at that.3:06 Dude, your mom isn't a gamer.

Again, welcome to the Internet.8:33 Let's just stop to appreciate that his talk is half way over, and he just got to the actual in-game evidence that GTA V is sexist.8:47 Well, I disagree, so we're automatically coming from different views about feminism. Please continue, though. Maybe your well thought out points will change my opinion.9:00 Wait, the male characters being good yet not female was an actual point?9:37 So they catered to their majority male audience. Sue them.10:27 No, you think the game is sexist, and I'm still sitting here waiting for those well thought out points I mentioned earlier.10:57 No, that isn't how things become art. I don't have to look at what the sociopolitical impact of my favorite songs are to appreciate them. Art takes many forms. You can interpret art however you want, but don't make it sound like it's a necessity for art to be scrutinized like that. Unless you mean to tell me that you paused Journey's "Don't Stop Believing" to contemplate the \textbf{gender} roles of the "small town girl" and "city boy" the first time you heard it.12:02 No, it logically implies they disagree with the people who say that there is \textbf{sexism} present in games that they enjoyed.12:43 Please refer to my first comment on this video. You want more females to have backstories? Stop making game developers afraid of being accused of \textbf{sexism} when creating a multi-dimensional female character.12:47 Either ignore them, or respond with evidence and logic. Simple, really.12:58 Even that laugh-happy audience found no humor in that terrible table-flipping joke (and I use the term "joke" loosely).13:15 Depending on the game, inserting a strong female character could completely ruin the dynamic. Some games would have their immersion ruined because of the time periods they take place in. Others would be affected because that character does not fit in with the other characters in the narrative or with the lore of the world in general. There are lots of reasons why adding a female character that you deem "appropriate" could mess up a game, the largest reason being that it may not fit the creator's vision and needlessly complicate things.13:21 I just disputed it.13:52 GTA V is not for little kids. No one is showing the GTA game series to children and going, "These are the people you should look up to." What are you even talking about?14:54 Oh, yeah! Feel free to punch anyone who doesn't agree with you in the face!15:05 Yeah, because Nintendo goes for the family demographic more than some other gaming companies. What I don't understand is why you were criticizing that strategy at the beginning of the video. You do realize that catering to families, including multiple ages and both the male and female demographics, helps them achieve that diversity, right?15:23 When will this stupid stereotype end? That is not gaming culture anymore! Gaming is not a "Boys Only" club! No one is trying to stop girls from playing video games!15:52 Yes, including girls in the gaming community is a positive thing. What you fail to understand is that you grossly over exaggerate the number of people who are against girls in the gaming community. Just to be clear, by over exaggerate, I mean you greatly inflate it using misinformation and hyperbole until the problem is a thousand times more massive than it is. All this under the assumption that it is an actual problem, which I really don't think it is, and you have done \textbf{nothing} to convince me otherwise. 16:02 They need to grow up? Alright, mate.

Sure GTA V is a fun game and I paid money for it even after knowing how problematic it was because I like going online and sandboxing as a mute criminal, but it's so much harder to enjoy a game that actively excludes your demographic from it's potential customers. GTA V came out years ago and I only recently bought it because I stepped in for my brother while he was playing one time and had to go to the bathroom which made me realize that getting the game and playing online with him and with friends would be fun. Meanwhile for games like Dragon \textbf{Age}, Skyrim, The Division, and so many others that offer similar gameplay features (such as open worlds, sandbox, character customization, online play, etc.) I have been able to enjoy those games so much more. Even when they don't make an effort to inclusive of their audience, if they at least avoid alienating potential customers the game will be much more enjoyable. I admit that I've never found a game as fleshed out or detail-rich as GTA V (makes sense with how much it cost to develop), but there are a lot of games with are just much more pleasurable to play.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Transgender, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Gender - General, Sexual Identity - Transexuality & \cellcolor{green!27}3/227 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.322 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small 13:04Depending on the game, having a female character as the protagonist may be very unrealistic. For example, The Witcher or any game that takes place during medieval times. Men played very different roles back then than \textbf{woman}.

So it comes across as particularly cruel to then tell those people that despite the fact that they spend their entire lives keeping to themselves and trying not to cause trouble, they're still somehow bad and sexist and part of the problem, etc. It should be no surprise that when you make fun of losers, they'll get just a bit mad.

But when it comes to GTA, I don't see eye to eye with this guy. For GTA to be that way is for it to be GTA. It's also anti-police, pro-theft, pro-murder and prostitution (and many more).

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small So just a question I respect every single point he made but what about gta online it's the main game mode and there you can make a female character and then give your character their own background to give them character.  Or what about CoD zombies, there are no female character and I don't think anyone would consider that sexist.  If you think about it like what if they replaced Michael with a girl then you'd have people going on about how the mission where he gets kidnapped by the triad gang would be promoting kidnapping or \textbf{sexual} assault or something or what if Trevor was replaced with a girl then people would complain about how that character would be seen as overly bitchy or that just because a female franklin would be seen as a stereotype (I know he is already) but more so like "oh of course the \textbf{black} \textbf{woman} is single and in the ghetto".  Regardless of how sexist you think the game is the character work together and yes some of the women don't seem have story arches but really when you look at it they do Michaels wife Changes for the betterment of their marriage, Trevor and madrazos wife become friends and franklin can find a girlfriend and get over his ex and yes their are strippers and prostitutes but in reality they relate to the main story.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I think you'll find there's a lot of criticism because people disagree with him and one of my personal theories as to why the criticism becomes so hateful so quickly is because people feel like they can't contact and argue with him. This leads to people trying to write something attention catching, controversial and shocking. In response to your other point, I think you'll find a great difference between the two forms of game. Consider this: a novel and a poem are both forms of literature, both can take up great amounts of your time to analyse and enjoy. Would you group together people who love poetry and people who love novels? I wouldn't. People who enjoy poetry can obsess over the details of a single poem for lengths of time that I would find horrific. Meanwhile, a person who enjoys novels would need to go to an effort to return to a book, sitting down to read with a timeframe in mind because they don't want to be interrupted. The person may obsess over the story if they like it, really investing in characters and what's going to happen. These two don't translate perfectly and I must admit that my only experience of poetry nerds is from year 7 literature, but the point is the same. The two areas you're comparing are completely different yet happen to exist on the same medium. No middle-aged \textbf{woman} I know (or any \textbf{woman} I know) would be interested in a picking up Bioshock infinite for a couple days or playing a game of COD MW3 with me or joining me for some \textbf{elder} scrolls online, and I know a lot of middle-aged women.

When it comes to the \textbf{sexism} in the games, the \textbf{sexism} doesn't just stay within the game or gaming community, it goes beyond that into everyday life. Prejudice is not a natural occurrence, it is proven to be a learned thing, and a lot of kids play video games. This get into their subconscious, both boys and girls, and carries on beyond the game.

Say I've just told you my opinion about this movie and you've listened to me and now you want to discuss my problems and correct me but you can't because you are powerless. Should you get pissed even though reading my review was a voluntary action? No, but you will anyway. Prejudice is a natural occurrence, without it, you would be opening every piece of junk mail you receive to see if there's something worthwhile inside. Prejudice, to judge prior to knowing, is a human brain function that allows us to act on situations we cannot know the fullness of.

I don't know for certain that video games don't teach kids \textbf{sexism}. I know a couple kids who make large generalisations based on \textbf{sex} who are avid gamers but I know dozens more gamers who aren't sexist by any definition. Video games are a recent form of media but they include themes that have existed as long as language has and recently I think people have been a lot more 'equal.'

This isn't about "SJW's" and you don't have to be "liberal swine who's only doing the media's dirty work" to see that \textbf{sexism} is a problem. And as a female who has been told numerous times that because I'm a girl I'm not "allowed" to like video games. As someone who has been told time and time again that because I have two x chromosomes that I can't succeed in my chosen field of game development, and as someone who has repeatedly, over and over, time and time again been told "Video games aren't art" or "It's just a game, why does it matter?" I can tell you with all the pain and wounds still fresh that this behavior is unacceptable. I am misrepresented in my medium of choice in a world that is evolving too quickly for me to just sit back and wait for change because if we don't work for equality the future will be bleak not just for me, not just for females, but for everyone. Video games have changed my life and they can change others' too but if they are to reach those who need them we must stop trying so hard to ostracize each other. That is how we grow as a society. You don't have to like me or him and you can call him a "liberal" and a "hipster" all you want but that doesn't detract from the underlying point of this video; that acceptance is important, and that just because a problem doesn't directly hinder YOUR life, doesn't mean that it's not a problem to address or that it shouldn't be solved.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Sexism & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/350 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.286 \\  \hline

The lifestyle and worldview of those within "Grand Theft Auto" is very different from the worldviews that we as every day people hold. Their value system is different, and thus we can't hold it to the same standard we hold for our lives. Why? Because it's a game. Shooter games don't cause people to be shooters, and games with hot women don't cause men to be misogynistic \textbf{pigs}. With that being said, if "Grand Theft Auto" is out to be a sandbox game centered around crime, city life and the harsh realities that come with it, I don't want its implications to be neutered for the sake of political correctness. To bring a game like this to its objective end, bring in the guns, the money, the prostitution, the \textbf{sex}, the drugs, the works...

I recently decided to switch to HOPA and adventure games because they are pieces of art and their story-line is absolutely impressive and you don't need to kill anyone. Game companies such as Artifex Mundi, Elephant, 5BN, Eipix and many more have managed to take this genre to the next level so that anyone can play without feeling excluded or discriminated against.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I am a girl and I have played video games all my life. I have never felt as if women were objectified in any game I have played. I do not need to have played GTAV to know that the game is a parody of American culture and that is what it is: a parody. Just because you don't like a game doesn't mean suddenly no one can play it. Say for instance I'm a Christian, I think GTAV is a revolting game because of its swearing and violence. Should it be taken away from everyone and be banned then? No, because that's my opinion.Now I don't know much about real online gaming since I was guilty of being a nintendo kid for most of my life. I do remember playing Halo 3 when I was around 9 or 10 on Xbox live. I don't at all remember being called a girl (probably because I just sounded like another 12 year \textbf{old} boy) but I do remember I even made friends with teenagers on it. I don't at all remember even hearing any sexist comments at my female friends. But of course, this could have all just been blocked from my mind when I was little.The game I currently play now online is Splatoon. I don't see any \textbf{sexism} there AT ALL. In fact, more people choose the girl inkling rather than the boy because the only real difference is the hair. It's a game where I can literally pay no mind to who I'm playing against especially since there is no voice chat.I do hate that I am in the minority who play real games (not candy crush, that is revolting to me). And \textbf{gender} roles are very much evident in society. For example at my school there was a guys night and a girls night. The guys got to play video games. The girls watched cheetah girls... For my J-term, there are two out of the 15 options available that are guy only, none only for girls. The guys one was a bible fellowship thing (which is understandable since it's a christian school and boys and girls have different teaching needs). But the other was video games, paintball, and lazertag! Meanwhile the rest of them can be summed up as cooking, crafts, art, photography, and going to the city. Literally two of my friends were annoyed that this was a boys only option.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small At the risk of getting my own Internet Rage responses, I agree with some of his points. But I will state two things beforehand: First, I have never and will never play a GTA game not because it is sexist, but because the concept sounds intensely boring to me. And second, the GTA series has a long history of being the series people use to point out problems, or blame for bad parenting. When GTA first came out it was thought to have influence teenagers into stealing cars. Now it's being used as an example of \textbf{sexism} in gaming. But GTA is not alone in its 'objective \textbf{sexism}' issues either. And before you complain about the 'lack of agency for the male villains and henchmen' consider that you can make that complaint without it being taken as 'waging war on gaming'. No villain's are given 'agency', no henchmen given back stories. The same holds true when it is female villains, though there is a decided lack of female henchmen. Henchpersons? That's not really fair either, but it isn't worth arguing about when the female models in games as free and open as Skyrim still have men in pants for (most) of their armor styles, and women in skirts and fur bras. Can we take a moment to accept that the real complaint is not that women aren't present in so many games, it's that we depict them as targets and rewards in so many games? The issue is the narrative more so even than the fact that my female Hammer-wielding Nord in skyrim is still wearing a fur skirt. The narrative needs to alter. To adapt. And not even for all games. Just more games. Having never played GTA games, I can safely state they will always be a target of critic and ridicule because the content of their sandbox. But they are a game that targets a specific group of people. Demographics in gaming is important to consider. But just imagine how much more money the gaming industry could make if more games were 'inclusive'. If I could run around as a BAMF female in GTA V, and beat the tar out of male prostitutes... Still doesn't sound like my kind of game, but I'm not their target demographic. And all this is before considering the sometimes toxic nature of gaming in MMOs toward female players. Often, when the male gamers discover they're in the presence of a female gamer, instead of talking about games, they start sexist jokes ("put down that controller and pick up mine") or it becomes a flirting competition, which can be creepier to hear than the sexist comments. When, really, that female gamer may just want to roll around and kill some stuff, do the quests, beat the tar out of that player there in a duel, and let the fact of their anatomical differences not impact their gaming experience. That was a lot for a stupid youtube comment... But I feel he missed some important points and wanted to share...

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small As a genuine female gamer who knows plenty of other female gamers, this is all genuinely stuff that happens. The problem with games like GTA is that their communities are also incredibly sexist.

Let the stereotypes come and prove people wrong if you hate them so much, at least that's what I do. Quit whining on the Internet and start getting out there and actually contributing to the eradication of stereotypes—which, personally, I don't mind much, as I am not a butthurt, idiotic leftist and find them rather comedic in 2017.And also, who cares if females don't play guy-intended games as much as males? Can we please just look at everyone at the individual level and STOP incorporating \textbf{gender} and, most annoyingly, \textbf{race} into nearly everything? It really depends on the people themselves. Societal norms/expectations don't impact people when it comes to gaming, to be honest, so shut up SJWs. Some people are interested in games, and some people simply aren't, like how some like reading and some don't. Society definitely plays a role in your life, but it doesn't determine you. We're not victims of social constructs, feminists. Stop making the problem bigger than it should be (doesn't relate to the video but I just wanted to get that off my chest). Look, man, if you're going to cry about the portrayal of women in a game, how about you visit Las Vegas yourself and take a look at all the billboards and posters? It's not that far from reality, just saying. But not the point, the point is to stop bringing freaking minorities into everything and treating men like the ultimate enemies; shut up about the \textbf{patriarchy} and contribute something useful to our society, please. \textbf{Sexism} and \textbf{racism} with all those SJWs running around is already bad as it is.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender, Patriarchy, Race, Racism, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}5/325 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.538 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I'm all for stating one's opinion, trying to be objective, heck, even saying that GTAV is sexist if you really think that's true and you do find some information to prove your point. But misuse of actual information in a misleading way is not OK. Yes, the game has 3 male main characters. Is that sexist? Maybe. Why? Because the game developers are obviously trying to appeal to a male audience, probably thinking something along the lines of "More men than women play videogames, so with these characters they can feel immersed". But you'd be wrong. The only character that you're really supposed to feel "immersed" with is Franklin, and he's fucking \textbf{black}. Are you going to say that the game is \textbf{racist} because the main protagonist isn't white? Of course not. Does that mean, then, that the game is sexist because he isn't a \textbf{woman}? Of course not either. Franklin is the protagonist, Michael and Trevor are simply plot devices. Granted, you could argue that not being able to see the world through the eyes of a \textbf{woman} might be sexist, I'll give you that one.On the blonde \textbf{woman} in a bikini thing, okay, I can see how you can see that as sexist, but that's just part of the franchise. It's a running thing. She's the icon of the game even if she doesn't appear in the game, because such characters have always been what have been used to represent the franchise. It's the way to make the game recognizable as part of the GTA franchise. It might be sexist, maybe, but it isn't there to serve the purpose of being sexist, it's there to serve the purpose of making the game recognizable.And on the quests that shame women... come on, don't get me started on this one. That quest is part of a quest chain in which you are pretty much forced into dealing with a paparazzi. The whole quest chain is portrayed in a bad light, and the character (Franklin) constantly comments on how fucked up what they're doing is.

Most of the women play completly other "casual" games. The women that play other games doesn't seem to have your problem otherwise they probably wouldn't play it. I don't play horror games but that doesn't mean that I want them to change. I just stick to the games I like. 2. You clearly misrepresent gamer and most trolls in gaming are way younger than that guy between 13 and 15. Trashtalk is also \textbf{common} in gaming, you should know that. Its probably not very nice but it is not especially bad towards women.3. I personally think that the response to game Spot was understandable and just to be clear "this \textbf{woman}" is something different than "a \textbf{woman}" a lot of you feminist don't get that. She brought \textbf{Gender} up first. Also a critic is not immune to critisim, happens all the time (remember gothic 3?). 4. Since when is anyone safe from critisim. I what world where you living until now?5. The number of lead characters can't be sexist. That is not how sexim works.6. So they paid a \textbf{woman} to help them sell their game by doing what she does for a living? Dispicable.7. Reason 3: At this point i am wondering if you lack the abillity to see males in video games if they aren't a lead character. The same applies to men. This game is satire so it uses sterotypes. Also you can't give every bystander a elaborate backround. 8. Reason 4: You play a criminal in that game that straight up murders people, but that is your problem? Sry but by you logic this game has to be misandrist because the lead goes more against males with much harder crimes, or would you have prefered it, if the mission would have been to murder thos women?9. If you like building straw men so much, why don't you become a farmer.10. You don't decide what satire is. 11. If your looking for raw models gta is really not a good place to look for anyone. But why should it be. Educate your kids yourself.12. You admit that they are good female lead in video games. Why do you think that it is important that every game is the same? That is what i am getting from you.13. Punch people who disagree with you mindset. In the year 2014 a joke in the year 2017 a bitter reality. 14.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Sexism in different forms of media isn't the problem, because it doesn't create \textbf{sexism} it just appeals to the \textbf{sexism} that already exists in different individuals.  The way I see, the guys that love the sexist aspects of GTA need a world in which they can run around and let that part of them act out.  I'd rather they do it from their own home with fictional characters than in public.  People that want to do something about \textbf{sexism} need to figure out how to change it from its heart rather than censor games.  I admit this is easier said than done.  Not all men are sexists but those that are seem to have the concept ingrained in the psyches.  We can probably only help the next generation.  I think maybe more positive roles for genders.  For example, I'd like to see more strong, intelligent men that treat women with respect on TV shows, nearly all TV shows depict men as idiots.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Sexism & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}4/162 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.469 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Women are notoriously difficult to cater for. I still don't understand what perfect female character is supposed to be. They shouldn't be ugly but they shouldn't be too pretty. They shouldn't dress like a Cromwell era housewife but they can't dress too slutty. They should be proud to be female and be proud of their body but they shouldn't show their body off too much so they attract the "male gaze". They should be physically strong but not too strong or they'll just be a man with boobs. They should be emotionally strong but at least still a little sensitive to show they still have a feminine side. They should be a leader of men but at the same time shouldn't be too bossy in case it perpetuates stereotypes of women being micromanaging control freaks. They should be proud to have free sexuality but at the same time they cannot just sleep with male members of the cast for funsies ala \textbf{Zero} from Drakengard 3 because that idea might expand dong. All these contradictory ideas. If were a game dev I'd just make a guy my protagonist. What does the guy character have to be? Well he can either be a stunningly handsome manly man or a complete clown, it doesn't really matter as long as he fits the tone of the game I'm making.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Ok so i know that GTA 5 is very sexist i know that, but that is how GTA as always been that way, and that's just how the game has always been for years. In addition, it kind of in a way portrays what real life our real-life society is like while being a little bit over the top i mean like jimmy is a perfect example and image of a deadbeat pothead who does \textbf{nothing}, but play overly violent video games, and tracey is an example of some of the stuff that some ppl will do to make it big in hollywood. Again, like i said it is a very offensive game a lot of games are like that such as deadpool (which is a game), duke nukem forever, left for dead series, i could go on; the point is are these most of these game companies likely to change the answer is no especially not Rockstar mostly when it comes to GTA cuz it's always going to be offensive as shit, the more you're triggered the happier they are.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!27}1/181 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.552 \\  \hline

(war games... youre killing tons of male soldiers in a cruel fashion but that isnt a problem now is it? even though there are certain female characters in a wargame, theyre usually portrayed as badasses already) TL;DR No matter what you do there will always be a way to offend someone for portraying women "wrong". people hating on video games because of these reasons should go do someting usefull with their lives and let people enjoy their games. theyre meant to BE fun, not to make fun of certain parts of society FFS!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/220 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.455 \\  \hline

On top of that the poster is \textbf{sex} sells that is our society you can't expect a company to neglect a profit making tool. But that is a societal problem that probably won't change. Additionally this game makes women and men look equally bad and good in different regards. This game has terrible men pathetic men and the general slimiest of the slime for men. But yes it also does that to women. Plus female leads wouldn't make sense. They mimicked \textbf{old} school bank robber groups who guess what are almost always entirely groups of men!

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I am pretty tired of hearing arguments along these lines.  Paul admits in this talk that respectable and powerful women have literally hundreds of examples across the board, but he spends 10 minutes talking about a single example of \textbf{sexism} in games.  (There are more, sure, but it is such a tiny percentage of the overall game market)  This is akin to me bitching about there being no gunfights in the latest RomCom.  If you find the content objectionable, don't play the game.  It's very simple.  There are literally millions of games you could choose from.  You talked about games being a form of art, yet people are trying to pressure the artists into compromising on thier artistic freedoms to create what they want to create.  It doesn't matter if that content alienates a certain group or not, it is thier work, and they should be free to include whatever they want.  I really don't see this level of backlash in other forms of media, most people tend to just avoid that which they find objectionable, but when it comes to games, developers have to walk on fucking eggshells as to not upset feminists, SJWs, LGBTs, or people like me, those that just want to be able to pick and choose from all the options available and decide what I would like to play that won't annoy or offend me.  What I don't do is try to censor and shame people who make or play anything with content I find objectionable.  As Paul said with regards to feminism, it's not about one side being held above the other, yet this is exactly what you are asking for.  You are asking for people that have a problem with things in games such as GTA to be catered to above people that don't have a problem with it.  Censoring things that make you feel uncomfortable, well, that isn't how artistic freedoms work.  Again, there are literally millions of games to choose from, play something you like.  I kind of want to play minecraft, but the blocky pixelated graphics are annoying and offensive to me.  Hey Mojang, could you please change the way you render your game so I can actually be included?  This is your argument.  I am not sexist, \textbf{racist}, bigoted, or whatever other label you want to throw around, and as studies have shown, playing games with a certain kind of content isn't going to have much, if any affect on a healthy mind.  If you start trying to dictate what is o.k. and what is not, free speech and expression dies, in fact, look around, it IS dying a little more every day.  Everytime a director edits thier movie, or a developer cuts content due to pressure from some organized group, or someone is forced to delete a youtube video because they said something that someone else didn't like, that is the path we are on, everything will just be bland and boring as to not offend anyone.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Racist, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/499 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.401 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small He makes decent points, the problem is that all of these talking points are destroyed when put into context.  GTA Online which is obviously the reason most people play the game allows players to create female characters that don't have to be over sexualized or they can if the player chooses.  This is choice and this is one obvious reason the game is not sexist.  Secondly, he states that the men are given back stories as to why they're monsters and that in the end they come of as roguish human beings.  Trevor one of the leads never receives a story like this and is always seen throughout the entire game as a sociopath and a homicidal maniac.  They never provide a reason for why he ended up that way.  In fact, none of the male characters are ever perceived as an every day individual, after all that would take away from the premise which is satire.   And yes it is actually satire.  Everything in the game is satirized from Weazel News to the ridiculous tv shows.  No one is safe in GTA.  He might think he has an argument by saying "I've talked to my comedian friends about satire" but their individual definitions of satire does not change it's existing one.  Satire doesn't always have to be subtle.  In many ways it's thrown in your face, just look at Monty Python.  All of the male leads are in fact, sociopaths with very bad life choices.  Shit, even Michael has a mid life crisis and starts robbing places again because he became complacent and miserable with his rather relaxed way of life.  Thirdly, the female characters are given a reason as to why they act the way they do and IMO, because the only way to view it is subjectively not objectively, are more humanized than the male leads.  The reason Amanda acts the way she does is because she is also dissatisfied with her way of life, she misses the excitement Michael used to provide and is upset with him because he lays around and bitches rather than actually doing something with himself.  Tracy acts the way she does because neither Michael or Amanda are involved in her life resulting in her becoming a spoiled self entitled \textbf{brat}, just like Jimmy.  Anyone who has been involved in a relationship that amounts to something more than "Yes honey Whatever you want honey" knows and understands that something similar (by similar I mean on a smaller or sometimes larger scale) happens in every relationship and every couple goes through a point like this.  I could go into loads more detail about how he is wrong, but I would need a proper format to do so.  All his opinions about the game show is that he either never played it or was too busy picking out its faults to pay attention to the story and character development.  Video games are an art form.  That's what they are.  No one picks apart Eminem's songs because they occasionally contain sexist remarks, they analyze the entire song, and the story they tell that explain why those sexist remarks are there.  That's the point.  Context is key, and this guy completely missed it.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Brat & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!27}1/537 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.186 \\  \hline

NOT. \textbf{SEXISM}. IT'S SILLY HUMANITY MUDDLING THROUGH, TRYING THEIR BEST, AND MESSING UP.  The best way to fight the problem is to pick up and move on to be more mature, and let the people learn that they are being immature. No social justice, no crying wolf, and certainly not stripping away creative freedom to fit someone else's context of good.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nobody, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/149 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.342 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small If almost 50 of the gamers are female, then they clearly don't care. So why is this hipster talking "for" us. Here's an idea: If women hate \textbf{sexism} in gaming so much, why not...oh I don't know: MAKE YOUR OWN GAMES!There are plenty of women already doing that. (Portal, Assassin's Creed etc.)And a lot of forms of art are sexist: Movies, paintings, sculptures, most of the operas, plays and ballets. Yet we motivate kids to go see these forms of art. Yes these things were made in a different time where \textbf{sexism} was ok, but you don't see that written down on the information sign next to a painting. You don't read in a review about Orfeo et Euridice that they portray the \textbf{woman} as weak. You read about how well they portrayed the story. (Yes, videogames are a form of are if they have a good storyline,  distinguished style of graphics or an unique form of gameplay, but do you consider MK to be art? Maybe the art of ripping someone's spleen out through his nostril...but actual art? Nah...)\textbf{Sexism} in videogames is bullshit. There is a reason why there is an \textbf{age} restriction on certain games. Because Rockstar thinks that we gamers can distinguish the difference between a game and reality. And in 99 of the games you do things that are bad, illegal, sexist,  etc.  You don't write a review about COD and say: "Yeah, all those guys shooting is a really bad think. Shooting is bad....blah blah blah."  We know it's bad, and that's why we do it in a videogame. GTA in this example is 18+. All gamers and yes, also the men, know it's just a game and won't start treating women in real life any differently than they did before the game. Also Assassin's Creed(developed by women) never had a female protagonist up until Syndicate. (Not counting the port.) AC has always been misogynistic. Always the masculine protagonist saving the ladies. (Especially Ezio.) As a female gamer I've never experienced negativity towards women. Yes we do get a little extra attention, but never negative. Male gamers are also adjusting to the fact more and more women play videogames. Almost every game has a online mode these days and when they notice a female playing on the other side, they are often surprised but friendly and positive. To be fair: The comments on that review are horrible. But I don't think mentioning that it's sexist, is needed. Gamespot also made a review about Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 and not once is mentioned how scarcely the  heroines are dressed or anything about their...ehm...proportions. (<3 Rachel) The comments are terrible but I do feel this lady was just jumping on the \textbf{sexism} train like all those damn hipsters these days. (Just like this man.) Please just let me blow up strip clubs and drive over hookers in peace. Because of these people, soon, videogames all need to be politically correct and shit. One of the reasons I play videogames is to escape real life, don't bring real life into my videogame.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Top 5 reasons I want to kick the hipster in the balls1. "47 of gamers are women." Is he stupid?(Yes, he is) Playing Candy Crush doesn't make you a gamer, it's simply means you have 5 minutes to waste. Don't \textbf{dumb} down games to something that idiotic. More reasonable stats to look at would be for example, the 2 of women who play sports games,  7 who play FPS and 10 who play MOBAs. That's a realistic picture of gaming.2. "Games needs to be looked at through the prism of politics, \textbf{race} and \textbf{gender}." No, they really don't. Games are fantasy, and the creators should be free to create imaginary worlds how ever they want. GTA shouldn't be critiqued for containing \textbf{sexism} more than Counter Strike should be critiqued for containing "men portayed as violent" or "too much guns". Clearly this hipster has trouble differentiating games and reality. Showing violence in a game doesn't justify or promote the act violence, even 5 year olds understand that.3. He claims that "we", meaning the gaming community want games to be considered "art". That's rediculous, and that's just his own personal hipster opinion. Games are entertainment, that does not equal art. There is art in the form of games, but that's not even close to the same thing.4. Implying that the vocal minority of 9 000 gamers, is a good representation of a community of hundreds of millions of gamers. No, we are not all insecure brats who can't stand a \textbf{transgender} game reviewer. We all hate hipsters who disgrace our community with bullshit though.5. These stupid jokes.

Gouging out of eyes: perfectly fine. Removal of limbs: a-okay. The most cruel, painful and horrendous ways of dying are depicted in video games - but \textbf{sexism} is a no-go?Essentially, why should a video game be allowed to depict the murder of a human being, but \textbf{sexism} (particularly towards the fairer \textbf{sex}) cannot be depicted?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small 1). Yes, they do cater mostly to men, because most actual gamers are men. Sure, 50 of people who play video games are women, but that's only if you include mobile gamers, and casual gamers. The gamers who generally spend money, are generally hardcore gamers, and those are mostly MEN. And no, playing mobile games don't count you as a gamer, just as throwing instant- noodles into the microwave doesn't make you a cook. A certain degree of interest in devotion is needed in a subject.2). Most famous game developers are men, sure. But \textbf{nothing} is stopping women from designing games. If less women choose to make video games, there will (obviously) be less female developers.3). "Girl gamer" is a term some people use online in the gaming community. If you are so sensitive as to the point that you feel harassed when someone calls you a "girl gamer", then stop playing games. The gaming community has some people that will say some rude things, and if you can't take shit like that, and just ignore or get over it, then the internet isn't a place for you.4). "You can't choose not to be a sexist prick" in GTA 5. Sure you can. As you said, in a sandbox, or open-world type game, you do with it what you will. You can \textbf{race} around the roads, install the LSPDFR mod...etc, but point being, you make with it what you will.5). Yes, people don't like it when ridiculous feminists cry "objectification, \textbf{sexism}" in games. Sure, you might not like what they put on billboards/on the radio stations...etc, but that's a minor nitpick far and away removed from the missions, and open-world activities that encompass the game's major features. It's also ridiculous to claim that this game is purely sexist towards women and portrays them poorly, when most of the male characters are druggies, criminals, and would most likely be serving time in jail, in the real world. Yes, it's her job, but when she makes ridiculous arguments like that, people do have a legitimate reason to want her fired, and give criticism like that. Now death threats are crossing the line, but can you purely say that's because they're a \textbf{woman}, and \textbf{transgender}, at that? Most people who say things online, and indeed many celebrities, get death threats. It's because the internet is full of people who do shit like that.6). No, being a man doesn't make you exempt from criticism. I think we can tell from the unusually high number of dislikes,  and the comments section here.7). Having 3 male leads doesn't make a game sexist. Same as having three female leads. Especially not when they are portrayed as criminals, and shadowy underground crime bosses. Just having three leads from one group doesn't mean that other groups are discriminated against, it just means that those leads happen to be male. There's little doubt that people wouldn't be crying "sexist" if there were three female leads.8). Having a beautiful \textbf{woman} on a poster doesn't qualify "\textbf{sexism}". It means that people have a reasonable, and completely tolerable quality of admiring beautiful people.9). I don't know how you can cry about "depiction of women" when men are once again, depicted as mostly criminal. And yes, you can't interact with them, because they're like movie extras. The point is, they're here to trigger an event that must happen, and when that is done, they leave the picture.10). That's not sexist, that's just blatantly stupid. Two different categories. \textbf{Sexism} is discrimination against a \textbf{gender}, specifically for the reason they are that \textbf{gender}. You haven't proven causation, simply correlation.11). If you make ridiculous claims such as " so and so game was sexist", when it wasn't, you'd be rightfully attacked. Some may choose to send threats- stupid, but \textbf{common} online for anyone who is to any degree famous, attacks such as "you're shit", once again, \textbf{common} online, or factual criticism. Backlash against unfair criticism isn't \textbf{sexism}, it's fair, and understandable self-defense of a community12).Why should developers have to cater to your needs, and put women as their lead? Same for men! The \textbf{gender} of a protagonist is hardly an issue paramount to the quality of a game.13). Feel free to punch them? Hardly a good talking point for people who complain of fake violence against women in games, to advocate real violence against a mostly male audience. Hypocritical, no?14). No. No one is stopping women from playing games. If they wanted to play or develop games, they could go right ahead. It's more of a crowd of people who chat and interact, who happen to be mostly men. Your analogy is moot. Furthermore, the claim that "the air smells fresher, everything is nicer" when girls are around, compared to when boys around, is a bit sexist, don't you think?\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Common, Gender, Nothing, Race, Sexism, Transgender, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General, Sexual Identity - Transexuality, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}14/816 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.716 \\  \hline

But not big titles. You know... The largest part of the video game industry. We would love to see more girls in video gaming, gaming overall. But that won't happen if people like you spread lies and miss informed statements that the video game industry is sexist. Try convincing a yew that video gaming is cool.. If all they've heard all their lives bin lies about how video game industry is antisemitic. If you wanna talk about a sexist industry go talk about porn, where a male actor gets paid 10 of what a female actress does... Oh wait, that's not even sexist. It's called supply and demand. And there are reasons to everything looking the way it does. No WRONG! 2:34 minuets into the video and you're WRONG!

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Ok here is the problem with this video, I will admit this is my second attempt at a comment since my first a tried to write as I watched the video, bad idea I can't type that quickly. Ok now. GTA 5 is not intentionally sexist, and there is one someone reason for this, rockstar games is a company and simply not including a \textbf{gender} would extremely danger sales.Now I will abstain from going too in depth as this is a view shown by most of the actual "gaming community", Now on the talk itself, gamers are not just "smelly boys" "shaking their fists" at women in gaming. This is the problem so many people like u bring up, generalisation, the mean \textbf{age} of a gamer is 33, and make, so we are not "boys" and it has been proven to have positive \textbf{mental} effects so this general view is highly insulting and this agism can be argued to be as bad as the \textbf{sexism} you complain about, actually I wrote an essay recently  bringing up the point. The generalisation of an entire group taking part in an activity is not as socially ingrained as \textbf{sexism} but still is a major problem and something that needs to be delt with.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small may i just say 1 stop saying each \textbf{gender} e.g males play games more than females we are equal when it comes to video games no matter what \textbf{gender} you are male or female  there are billions trillions of us on earth you can't really just assume that and think your right.  2nd of all yes the game is a little sexist at times but  it isn't horrible  they are just only jokes and the game is mostly built on humor so it doesn't take it self seriously which is the point of this game, there meant to stereotype these things. there's \textbf{nothing} wrong with the game so I'll point that out that to this guy who did that speech he's wrong on that part  and in multiplayer you do have the option to play as a girl which i feel makes the multiplayer universe equal to all players, but however.. 3rd of all!! NO its not ok to put down the female  down for saying a game is sexist, us men and women have a right to video games and to give women death threats and tell them there shit and worthless for pointing out stuff like this in video games i feel is wrong, we need to be treated more equal in the gaming comity sure there might be some sexist games and people might be offend but either way it doesn't  give you a right to start sending death threats and making fun of a person just cause they disagree a little. and yes girls can be gamers to stop acting  judgemental people\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/266 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.128 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Kaylen Wanstall Oh. Well, in the eyes of marketers, it's incredibly important, as they know who to market to. Scientifically speaking, across wide trends of people, there are not insignificant differences between the sexes. Generally, males will enjoy more action-y, competitive games, and women won't. This doesn't mean there aren't any women that play those games, obviously, and that all male gamers play those games, obviously, but it is a simple generalization. Heck, I know multiple women that enjoy those types of games, and since I frankly suck, they're all probably better than I am, but still.Again, there are many exceptions, but apparently not enough to make marketers switch tactics.With what you say about bashing the reviewer... It's bad and immature, but that's gonna be something that won't stop. I doubt it has anything to do with the \textbf{sex} of the reviewer either, and more with the fact that she said GTA should be docked for being sexist, which, obviously, is like getting upset about \textbf{racism} in media taking place in the 1800's.... it's gonna happen. In fact, while I agree that you shouldn't ever get mad at people for disliking a part of a game, the way you phrased it almost makes it seem like you're suggesting that when it's a girl that's especially bad, which sounds like a double standard.

If you play an RPG for three game cycles and level all your characters to the cap to get all of the  achievements, you're a hardcore. If you play candy crush sometimes because you've got \textbf{nothing} better to do you're a casual.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small As a \textbf{woman} gamer no im not interested in playing gta or candy crush. But i do like first person shooter games! like fallout 4 where I can be a female avatar and there aren't prostitutes. They lost me on the prostitute's it reminds me of when i was a much younger version of myself playing doom for the first time on pc and stumbling on the in game strip club.  It left a bad taste in my mouth and i didn't finish the game. The only kind of uncomfortable i want to feel in a game is if im pretty sure im about to step on a bomb but i cant see it. Women would be more likely to play games if the market wasn't strictly geared twords men. How likely am i to buy a game with a half naked lady on the cover? Not so much... i even stopped playing games where male armor is displayed super discreet where you only see their head if they dont have a helm but women armor of the same kind is more like a bikini.... We like playing games too and i assure you if i were on the bus and i had my laptop and a good internet connection i would be scrounging the wastelands however mobile apps cant complete maybe instead of complaining about her candy crush mobile app show her a better one like amcs walking dead or clash of kings or something. Why don't you find us in game? Most serious female gamers pose as men in mmo myself included. Why? Because you dont take us seriously or you throw so much loot at us it breaks the game for us and then when we get really good you take the credit for it. So you know what?

I'm all for more women in gaming.  I want more than anything to find a girl that shares my interests, and gaming is a big interest of mine.

But yeah, I have real doubts about that 47 claim.  I'm pretty sure at least half that number is girls who only kind of like video games, or ones that pretend to like them in order to get guys.

Especially when you talk about shaming someone for having \textbf{sex}. The importance of that scene in the plot was exposing her as A LIAR not slut shaming her and the way you twist that is just ugh.

People who truly love a medium or an artform should be the most critical of it. Speaking out against \textbf{sexism} in games does not mean you are trying to take fun out of games. If \textbf{sexism} is fun to someone then they need to assess why they find that enjoyable and think about the negative effects on themselves and others.The whole reaction to this video down here in the comments pretty much exactly proves his point. Certain people off in a corner end up feeling threatened and look to stagnate intellectual and artistic growth. They treat ideas like social equality, which every reasonable person should be in favor of, with not just a skepticism towards specific ideas or claims but rather a general disdain for the entire goal. That's a sad view to hold about something like that. \textbf{Nothing} in this video will make games worse for you.

If there are 3 male leads that makes the game sexist already. No, would you say makeup now a days is sexist because it is all marketed towards females when more and more of men are wearing it... 2.) Posters..... literally \textbf{sex} sells in marketing. 3.) By any chance did you play the game... this game shows light of all typical stereotypes of all races and genders. People want to escape the real world when playing video games. This makes fun of everything. \textbf{Nothing} was off limits. 4.) There are quests for everything, the reason that happened in a quest is to show how Hollywood is and the paparazzi are. Again.... \textbf{sex} sells....Then you list stereotypical responses of gamers of the questions. All in all paul, you thought you could make your break by doing this Ted Talk.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small by 1:17 he's already decided not to attack sexist sentiments, but the people who may or may not hold them.\@ ~2:00 he asserts game studios rarely consider female gamers as a potential target audience, this is something we already know to be untrue. one need look no further than the ad campaigns that currently exist for games. take, for instance, CoD's recent efforts to provide a nearly even split between the genders when representing it's playerbase in it's ads. \@ ~2:40 he presents the thinly veiled straw-man of "male gamers hate female gamers". however he never provides any evidence for this claim. nor does he recognize it even as a claim. this is hardly surprising as his argument would otherwise fall apart.his entire rant on GTA-V. im sorry, but what was the point. i feel like his issue is that you can only play as male d-bags. but if that's the case then he presents his central premise last then provides \textbf{zero} supporting evidence before hastily moving to talk about this game reviewer. how is this what makes it into a ted-talk? GTA-V tells a story about a group of male d-bags. it's the story that was written and it simply didn't include a playable \textbf{woman} because the story didn't need one. that's not \textbf{sexism} that's artistic integrity."very fair review"? well you've only really established that you agree with the review. now, I've not personally read this review because i don't go to gamestop for reviews. or anything really. but we're just forced, AGAIN, to take you at your word here.ah yes, let's cherry pick comments. frankly i'd rate GTA-V significantly lower than a 9 or 10, not that i think it's bad, or that it would matter. but this is the definition of anecdotal. it proves \textbf{nothing} relevant to the overall discussion. but you go on step further and include what is obviously a troll comment.i was waiting for the death threats bit. let me be clear about this, EVERYONE RECEIVES DEATH THREATS. caroline did, anita sarceesian did, donald trump has, you probably have. I'VE RECEIVED DEATH THREATS AND IM A FUCKING \textbf{NOBODY}. yes a bit anecdotal, but i'm talking about what is a clearly defined trend. though, to be fair, so is hateful responses to 3rd-wave-feminism, so i guess your comment readout gets a pass. well, at least the 2/3 that aren't trolls.8:30 into the talk and we are only now going to be presented with what the presenter conciders to be objective evidence. impressive.reason 1 - 3 male leads. good news, i've already rebuffed this. how unfortunate it must be to be so predictable.while we're at it im going to go ahead and guess that one of his next points involves the amoral actions of one or more of said leads. to which i would respond, they're meant to be amoral. this is GTA, you play a criminal. you are playing as a villian. your actions are intended to be reprehensible. again, this is about proper story telling, not some kind of hidden sexist agenda on the part of rockstar. nor is it that they only view their playerbase as male, or that they would desire such a thing.reason 2 - the marketing includes provocative female imagery. this is a game with hookers and hook-ups. that is absolutely a character in the game, or at least it is a legitimate mechanical component of the game. are you saying games that appeal to audiences with this sort of content are inherently sexist? because there's \textbf{nothing} wrong here. this doesn't discriminate by \textbf{gender}, only by orientation. i.e. lesbians may very well be interested in the same material. and even in regards to discrimination by orientaion, that's only the case because they're not supplying much beyond this one 'dish'. i'm not going to complain that i can't order icecream at a steakhouse.reason 3 - yes these are the women that the main characters surround themselves with, by concious choice or otherwise. any intelligent \textbf{woman} would keep their distance from any one of our three douchecateers, hence, they're absent.reason 4 - yes, its a terribly shitty thing to do. i'd get into this, but i already predicted and rebuffed this point back at reason 1. \@ 10:00 no i have not been convinced that the game is sexist, once again you make an assumption and just roll with it.if i saw somebody making such a claim, like here with you, i would feel like somebody is making a poorly founded argument and i'd seek to debate the issue. oh, here we are. some folks would respond worse, and some would respond similarly but with less smarmy-ness. however, i'd wager that few would agree. though i wont pass off that wager as a fact. see how this works?\@ 10:40 and we have succeeded, it is legally recognized as such and the culture is slowly sing around to fully accept this as well. calling a game sexist solely because it's not kindergarten-level inclusive does not help. period.yes ebert got death threats, for many things, like most people do. give 12 year old's keyboards and an internet connection and that's what you get.11:50 saying you don't care about \textbf{sexism} =/= endorsement of \textbf{sexism}. i understand inaction is itself an action, but this is textbook false equivalency in order to commit ad hominem.

Now, I've never seen anything that offends me as a man in a videogame, so I've always been comfortable with that aspect of the industry, but women are every bit as entitled to the gaming experience as me, and their experience is currently quite different from mine. What people need to understand is this a bias created long ago that persists, and needs to be shut down, not the delusions of reactionary \textbf{feminazi}.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small This topic always grinds my gears. \textbf{Sexism} exists in gaming, period. Not only for women, but for men as well. The stereotypes for characters in games have barely changed over the years - and just because people hadn't complained before doesn't mean we can't or shouldn't now. And most of the feminists who argue that the females in these games should be altered don't mean omitted or watered-down, they just want them to be represented accurately and a little more PC. And not to mention the community itself. You can argue that it is not inclusive or supportive of the general concerns of the majority - and yes, nearly half of the community is represented by females.So as a personal message from me to those who continually try to keep change out of the industry - grow up.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small +Keelan Moore I never said "having a racial minority as a lead" is a problem, I was just using it as an example. your analogy isn't great, then again no analogy is perfect, of course you have to fix a technical flaw because the whole game might not work if it isn't done (I don't know how big the flaw is) but if someone doesn't like something simply because it doesn't align with their views is not a valid reason to change the game. In the industry of gaming, much like any industry, feelings don't matter. The people that own these companies don't care who's feelings their hurting they only care about what makes money, and GTA V made a lot. GTA V's sexist themes, believe it or not, have traits in it that appeal to many people. So all in all, some people like the sexist themes and some people don't you can't please everyone. Hispanic isn't a \textbf{race}\textbf{sexism} is bad--- I can agree     \textbf{sexism} in video games is bad----- I cannot agreeif you say \textbf{sexism} in video games is bad, then killing in video games must be awful. If we had every good willed christian on the matter trying to stop violence in video games, you think that would take the enjoyment out of many video games?

My chemistry teacher plays Clash of Clans on her phone and TF2 at home many hours a week. It seems like you are prejudiced against certain kinds of games. When I was young and I had first moved out of my parents and in with some roommates we had a house computer with 16MB of RAM! It had Tetris and Doom on it and later in the decade we would network the computers and play Quake Arena. It only takes a few hours to complete Doom so we played Tetris competitively. I spent hours getting the high score and then slightly less than the high score in order to wipe my roommates names off the leader board. This went on almost daily for nearly a year. Beside Street Fighter II and Off Road at the local arcade this is the only game I played that year. So I guess by your standards I wasn't a gamer I was just someone who plays video games because I preferred a puzzle game for awhile. It's just anecdotal but it did seem that the women I knew then definitely preferred Tetris to Doom but when Quake Arena came out; probably because it was so novel at the time; women liked to play that. I could always find women friends to play Off Road at the arcade but fewer women played Street Fighter II. Whenever \textbf{Age} of Empires came out I knew a large contingent of women who loved and were real good at that game. I knew lots of women who liked Sim City. I play WoW with many women and it was fellow female employee who got me into that game back in the beginning of the 2000s.

This issue has \textbf{nothing} to do with respect though. And respect is earned IMHO, you don't automatically deserve my respect just for existing. "Video games were much more popular with women than men initially" That has \textbf{nothing} to do with the current situation though. "still doesn't negate the way women are handled in that franchise," Not sure what franchise you're talking about, but there's is \textbf{nothing} wrong with deciding to target the game to males who like fanservice and then including said fanservice, it certainly isn't \textbf{misogyny}. "since the oppression of women doesn't affect you, you don't care, and don't acknowledge it's existence." Games that target fan service liking men are not oppression towards women. (In my opinion such claims are a bit offensive to people who face real oppression.) "snobish nerd boys, who hate women deep down, keep shouting that they need the tits,..." Why would i want to see tits if i hate women? That sounds like twisted logic. That's like saying that i hate insects but still somehow want to see them in all the games, it makes no sense. "because if those are taken away we are suddenly taking away their rights, their things, their freedom." Well the only way to stop games with fan service from happening is to ban them, and that is taking away our things and taking away the devs freedom to create art freely. "it makes it seem like that's all that matters to them in a game." Just because someone likes to see fan service doesn't mean that they don't appreciate other things too. For example i did play undertale, and did like a lot of the things it did. "yeah Overwatch being so popular..." Sexy characters are a big part of why overwatch is popular, just look at how much fan art people create. "someone suggested "maybe not sexualize women in video games so much?"" People are doing a lot more than suggesting these days. "I believe men don't play video games to see sexy, poorly written, objectified female characters, so not having them won't alienate the male demographic, but instead draw in more women." There's some huge generalizations here. Lots of gamers like to play games with fan service and if presented with two good games one with and one without fan service will choose the latter, therefore not having the fan service will alienate those gamers. And there not all men either, some girls like the anime tits and asses too. "simply letting players choose \textbf{gender}, is an easy step forward." Depending on the game that can be very expensive and time consuming to the devs. A triple-a game with story and voice acting would require at least a whole new voice track for the second \textbf{gender}, and probably some tweaks to the script and alternate recordings for the NPCs. But if it's some game like a multiplayer FPS then i agree that devs should allow people to choose the \textbf{gender}.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender, Misogyny, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}7/569 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.23 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The thing about these developers is that they're not trying to push \textbf{sexism} against women as their main motive. Their intention is not to make a game in order to brainwash males into treating women like lower class. They're trying to ground the GTA series into realism according to what they see in the world of crime. The GTA games are pretty much a satire of American culture. The stories and characters are based off what people see in the world of crime. Whether it'd be gang violence, theft, murder...a lot of these kingpin druglords don't exactly treat women with respect. So why would the developers detach themselves from reality and make a character that kills/tortures people while at the same time having a moral compass solely for women? Audiences just won't let that sink in because it's not grounded in realism. The developers aren't adding \textbf{sexism} because "\textbf{sexism} sells," they're adding it because it's realistic to the character that is being portrayed. If the character is a violent gangbanging drugboss, why is it surprising that he also treats women like shit?For the people complaining about this stuff, I have to say: Are you willing to ban Stephen King books because they have violence towards children? Are you willing to ban every crime noir novel because all the women are sexy whores? Are you willing to ban every war film becaus "war is bad" ?

If you are not COMPETING IN TOURNAMENT, CREATING MODS, AND BEING ACTIVE IN STREAMS AND THE COMMUNITY, as a women, you are helping out the stereotype.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Not going to state my opinion on the matter here, but just based on some other comments and the video itself, you can't really blame gamers for not taking him seriously. He is incredibly disrespectful and disingenuous to those who disagree with him, and he spins the narrative in a so aggressively and hatefully that it seems more like a tirade than an argument. Those "OMG"s and troll faces in the counterargument section were just infantilizing his opponent's argument rather than greeting it with an air of credibility (Though for some arguments he presented by what I can in my experience say is a vocal minority, there isn't much that changes) Either way, very disrespectful and unprofessional. Acting like the target of your accusations feels very hypocritical.The constant "If you meet someone like this feel free to punch them" just ruins his credibility. He sounds like he's speaking out of personal vendetta, like he has some bone to pick.GTA is also more or less a criminal simulator. You perform very unsavory and violent acts for personal profit. Of course the player profits from the shaming, if they didn't they would have no incentive to do the mission. Not saying it's okay to do stuff like that, but you play as a criminal. \textbf{Sexism} is evident in games like this, and there are terrible people out there who propogate hate and discrimination by \textbf{race} and \textbf{sex}, but this may in fact be due to larger social issues. You see it all the time, people seeking to gain or maintain power look to the ever evolving forms of media as a scapegoat for larger societal norms. The war against rock, MTG card art censorship, comic book scares, D\&D causing satan worship, gaming causing violence, and today, gaming and \textbf{sexism}. Lastly, he speaks too generally about not only gamers as a people, but what constitutes as gaming. About the 47, there is a difference. For some, gaming counts as just playing a video game like candy crush. For others, it involves highly competitive games like LOL, DOTA, Overwatch, and CS:GO. In these spaces, the ratio of men to women is much lower. Not to say gamers don't like girl gamers, but in these games, it boils down to one factor: Are you any Good?Since many 'girl gamers' (a term I feel just makes matters of \textbf{sexism} worse) tend to play less competitive games and not take it seriously, players' past experience has created a stereotype of a bad player. People like Jaynee, Blarue, and Masaeanela don't get flak because they are good or laidback. The stereotype of the bad girl gamer is something that I feel is a real problem, but the way in which different demographics play their games matters a lot. Gaming isn't a predictable art form as some might lead you to believe, every game is unique and attracts different fans. GTA's popularity is largely contributed to it's massive media presence in the violence in video games debate. It may have gotten a bad rap, but it sold a ton of copies as a result and still remains in the public eye.That and his solution of more games like Nintendo games and mobile games diminishes the idea of games as art. Dark themes and challenging moral ideas are things games can dwell into. I doubt he would call Life is Strange anything other that art, as it is quite a good game, and other games teach different morals. GTA as a game is one whose history of success in the past has banked and made bank on controversy, MTG has one of the most diverse casts of characters is fictional media along with Overwatch. Overall, this could have been better. Some of his points were on such as those who will never adapt to changes in gaming, but as a person who plays games, this didn't really speak to me as much as it sounded like it spoke against me. I understand many in the audience likely didn't play games, know your audience, but it isn't right to oversimplify and villainize people like this. Without presenting clear evidence of the effect games have on \textbf{sexism}, this could be boiled down to people on the internet abusing their anonymity via the penny arcade "Respectable man + Audience + Anonymity = Unrespectable man" equation. Games are connected to the internet, and often, that formula qualifies in all forms of anonymity. You could play hearthstone for years and never hear a sexist remark unless you went out into open internet country, where you would be met with all forms of trolls and sexist, but hearthstone isn't to blame, people who wish to be mean will find their ways and their places. Gaming is just another place for it to happen, and we can try, but they won't leave. And to be completely honest, we have no right to tell them to get lost. Under the narrative of gaming being an inclusive space, we can't just selectively kick out ides we don't agree with. These people have no right to do it, we shouldn't either. \textbf{Sexism} in games will always be a problem as long as people bring personal biases into games. Most gamers just want to play games, we should simply not encourage exclusive behavior, and just play games. I don't know the full scope, but frankly, I just want to play my games and have fun doing so. I don't want censorship to appeal to any political group, that just makes games feel less real. Edit: And the boy's club analogy is also very bad. If the air smelled fresh they wouldn't be complaining and scowling The people who dislike women in games are a problem, but it is unfair to imply that all serious gamers are like that. There is certainly a grouch corner, but these people aren't representative of gaming culture, to focus on them isn't productive. There are those who need to grow up, but there are always those who will never change their ways. Don't make the shrew into a snake.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small If games were as simple as "chess", there would be no feminist or any socio-political agenda. But even chess, when it was invented, was played mainly by Kings and nobility who aimed to sharpen their military acumen and hone their skills in battle. In other words, these were men who played. Today, there a story woven into every game and every story deserves an interpretation. I wonder if Kings and nobility of the past considered if every chess piece had a story too? Will they be able to move the pawn knowing it has a wife and two kids? I'm a \textbf{woman}, and I play Skyrim but not GTA-V. I found GTA-V very violent and distasteful, not only because of the way it portrays women, but also the way it portrays men! But seriously, aren't we taking this a little too seriously?If women truly cared enough, and they truly represented 47 of the gaming community, I am pretty sure that change is around the corner. But too often are the masses led by a vocal few to a point where everybody starts taking up a view that is not even theirs. Remember: there are many types of games women can play and not all of them are competitive, hypermasculine, and misogynistic. Women need to pick their battles. Today, majority of nurses are still women but men didn't come barging in saying that the nursing industry is 'sexist'. Men just make different choices. As for female gamers who feel alienated and discriminated against...? You decide what is more important to you: the game itself? or the story behind it? If you're looking for a good game, you'll have to put up with the crappy story. Otherwise, stick to chess.

They won't listen to us... but will listen to their own.Yes, many of these games feature \textbf{sexism}. Why? Supply and demand and people are not making it clear that they don't want to play a game that features \textbf{sexism}. (That doesn't mean a game cannot be "sexy".)Personally I don't believe the majority of gamers would consciously choose \textbf{sexism} to be part of a game... but it happens because \textbf{nobody} speaks up.If anyone doesn't believe me, make a new account that looks female, go and blog.

Being called a girl is still an insult today.I always try to choose in a manner which will inspire others to do the same, maybe let them know they are not alone in this and they can stand up for what they believe in. Many times we should, even if we are beaten down.As for feminism, I don't live in the US, therefore I cannot speak to the situation there. I know where I live there is endemic \textbf{sexism} throughout society and it does come at a cost. I have left a very lucrative career because of it and I know others that have done the same.You are right about men, however I think the cause is social. Men are not taught to cooperate, they are taught to dominate. Everything is a game and effort is all that is required to win. Ergo, when a \textbf{woman} says no, they are losing and therefore more effort is required.If the answer continues to be "no", then someone is directly taking an action against them and therefore are to blame for the loss. The other person is often seen to be doing the wrong thing to them, personally.This needs to be changed at a very young \textbf{age}, in the meantime I think everyone who is aware of the issues, needs to speak up. I have seen a piece of crap male being nasty to a female, his friends exchange a glance, but don't speak up. They know the creep will take it badly. That needs to change. They need to know their behaviour is not acceptable and the victim of their actions won't be listened to, she's the "prize".The guys that I have met that are aware of the issues don't speak up. As you said, they do need to "see the need". If they can't do it for the sake of it being the right thing to do, then they should realise that one day, it will be their daughter facing the same thing.Thank you for replying, I enjoyed your comments. :)\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Sexism, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/384 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.781 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Aaaaaand here comes the "I felt alluded, so instead of asking myself why; I must do my best to sabotage a nice conversation by calling you a man-hater, and doubt your judgement" train. I'm just gonna ignore him, but this reminds me reminded of Sallinger's passage "That's the whole trouble. You can't ever find a place that's nice and peaceful, because there isn't any. You may think there is, but once you get there, when you're not looking, somebody'll sneak up and write "Fuck you" right under your nose "I also can't speak about the particularities of feminism in de USA from direct experience. But comparing it with the European feminism I have to agree with Amelia Valcárcel when she says protestant countries tend to have a form of \textbf{patriarchy} based on respect for the man (because he protects you ....from other men) rather than fear. In countries like mine \textbf{patriarchy} is based more on fear and violence than in the "homo sacerdos", the respect paradox or media influence; so everyday \textbf{sexism} may be easier to spot. But the situation in the entertainment industry is globalized enough that we can observe \textbf{sexism} there from almost anywhere in the world I think.Therefore, I can understand how the Boston woman's colleges movement, the "free love" philosophy, the \textbf{sexual} liberation and the values of the third wave took root and exploded in pop culture in the USA. That definitely helped Europe's deconstructing some taboos about women's sexuality, homosexuality and such; but it's not all rosy \textbf{colored}. It also came tangled with postmodernism, psychoanalysis, sadist thought and neo-liberalism in the perfect storm that gave birth to this "freedom and equality" system in which women are free "to polish their own chains", as Mary Wollstonecraft would put it. There's lots of confusion generate among young women when think tanks and pr machines identify feminist \textbf{sexual} liberation with "willing submissive objectification". Add to that some men devising new ways to own and use women like in the "good \textbf{old} days" and a horde of confused young boys, who seem to feel terribly oppressed by the fact that they are not able to get all the \textbf{sex} they want, looking up to them. That's the explanation I find most plausible for "the more free I see you, the more submissive I want you" subtenant motto that runs all these fantastical 3rd and 4th order simulacra, these symbols of women that have taken root in pop culture, social media, video games and entertainment in general. As a feminist, as a gamer, but mainly as a developer I have to agree that it all comes down to education. Constant education on how to re-educate oneself, how to evaluate and contrast all information, including the visual kind and the implicit kind, in order to extract patterns. The thing is, today we receive information mainly through straight up manipulated images designed to imprint on us as attention traps, images that construct a sort of parallel stereotypical reality that makes this "doublethinking" , this willful blindness possible. Most media serve mainly to sell available human brain time to advertisers and marketers. Don't remember who said this, but is still worth quoting: "education can try as hard as it wishes to fill their brains, we will empty them afterwards" .That's more or less what's happening imho, is not like these young boys lack education, family values or resources in most cases. Is more like all that is constantly being pushed into a corner of their brains to make room for all the massive amount of contradictory information they garter on a daily basis. Is not like parents don't care, is more like can't even begin to understand the world they live in and how to reach them. But marketers know a way to channel and exploit those frustrations: get them hooked on \textbf{sex} and violence, give them a sense of entitlement and call it "art" and "freedom". Then give them a target, and the wheels of patriarcal neo-liberalism will do the rest.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Colored, Old, Patriarchy, Sex, Sexism, Sexual & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - Black, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}10/672 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.488 \\  \hline

The only mobile game I've played was the snake on the nokia 3210. When I was a teenager, I was also one of those comic and fantasy reader girls that supposedly didn't existed back then...See, this is the problem with the etiology of \textbf{sexism} in culture. Like comics or sports, videogames have also been covered, oriented, presented and marketed as as "guys stuff" for the most part; which makes it difficult for girls to integrate and in turn creates this sterotype of hardcore gamers as male in our minds. When we are made to recognize there's also women in there, we lack the necessary media and culture reinforcement to picture them in the same situation. So another sterotype comes in handy, the one that says all gamer women go absolutely insane for colorful and cute mobile games, and shun violent or competitive games.  Hand in hand with that \textbf{old} stereotype that said girls didn't like fantasy unless it involved lots of princesses, and ponies, and pink stuff. But even if that was true, what makes you say mobile market is not representative, when it's public is much broader? What games audiences are those mythical  representative audiences? Pc, console, arcade gamers? AAA fans, pro MOBA players, artsy indie audiences, hardcore JRPG comunities, pokemon fans...?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small You can talk about how much of a special \textbf{snowflake} you are about gaming but you are not representative of the actual gaming community, and there is \textbf{nothing} wrong with that. Especially when the industry as a whole is naturally segregated purely by interest. The most respected surveyors, Pew Research, also claim 50 of all "gamers" are female. What this does not address, is what constitutes a "gamer". For starters, the idea that a gamer is simply someone who actively plays video games is a hollow definition and completely meaningless in public. If you were to analyze shooter games, you would find 80 are male, 80 for action, and 85 for sports. Even in games like WoW only 35 are females. So where are all of these women that supposedly encompass the overwhelming majority? In other areas of interest! Particularly showing an interest in puzzle, rpgs, and casual games. The only reason people get up in arms about lack of representation is because \textbf{gender} is taboo and it is politically correct to defend minorities. But as you should know, being politically correct doesn't mean it's the correct thing to do.Take Lego for instance. For years people wanted girl Lego toys. And Lego delivered. Yet everyone was outraged when they found out it was an intricately designed pink building restaurant about baking and cooking. What went wrong? For starters, if you wanted the Lego CITY set and you were a girl, then you should have just bought it. They don't even use male pronouns in their advertisements. Secondly, did Lego, a multi-million dollar company, just decide pink because it would best reflect the years of female oppression? Of course not. They do a ton of marketing research, looking for the best way to sell their product to a now specifically catered audience, women. It would not only be financial suicide to release their product without analyzing stereotypes, but would undermine everything advertisement stands for. Which is my last point. Marketing has always existed to push people's buttons. The so called "pink tax" myth on pink calculators is a great example. It's not because Texas Instruments is sexist, but rather as you don't believe women do go absolutely insane for colorful and cute. Pink calculators didn't exist at first. But the demand from women made thousands of company realize that women are willing to spend a little more for a change in color. Cue in capitalism and the rest is history. But you aren't alone, men are also exploited.So tying this to video games, if you want more games that cater to your specific wants, either group up with similar people and make that game, or show companies your wallets, or you are S.O.L. But whatever you do, don't waltz into any market and whine that you are not being catered to.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Brojn H Soooo, getting catered to is not a right, but non "casual gamers" (in terms of hours a week, type of game or what?) have the right to decide what type of content should games display?. On the other hand all companies must do whatever they can to cater to their clients, and of course a company like Lego has to do whatever it can to reach broader markets and demographics before releasing any product. Yet, targeting a female audience that's already there, and making products that are more friendly towards them so that audience may grow exponentially (and with it, benefits), is somehow wrong?I've think you've hit the capitalist marketing loop with the Lego thing without noticing. See, that's the problem with designing cultural content based on market research. Market research shows what some people liked in the recent past, and just that. Market research, Bernays type propaganda (oops, "public relations", sorry), cannot provide new cultural solutions to new cultural and social challenges. You may follow market research and make a profit with a cultural product; but arts and culture should be works that extract patterns from the present in order to imagine new futures. I don't see that happening at all in the mainstream videogame market; which is in turn influencing the mainstream film industry, and so on.  If you ask me, this was all well in the 90's and early millennium, but at this point most rehashed shit is starting to smell. For all the visual advances, narrative has barely improved at all. Which brings me to the "special \textbf{snowflake}" bit. Honestly I've never understood why so much sarcasm in the expression, obviously I have my circumstances, but I'm just one of many. I may be making my own games, like many other indie developers, other women are still fighting to get into the mainstream industry, and also many of them got tired of all the sexist bullshit in mainstream video games and gravitated towards the mobile game industry, films, TV and animation; simply because they were given better opportunities in a much less toxic environment. And many of them that don't grew up with video games may have been curious, but went for mobile games to play on the go instead. Can you blame them? You can't exclude them, patronize them, shoo them away; and then pretend they are "just not into it". They are into it, despite games not being designed with them in mind . I don't have the impression that the mainstream game community wants more female gamers, I'm under the impression that they want more "men with teats" that enjoy shooting heads up and beating up whores playing as thugs. So, by protecting your idea of what a video game is, you are actively preventing us from exploring what video games could become as we all need to survive in a market based economy.

You are pushing for a \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} herring as to why industries like video games are segregated based on \textbf{gender}, very \textbf{common} thing to parrot nowadays. And a wrong one at that.I think this discussion has hit a brick wall. The source of our interests being influenced also goes a little deeper than just money grubbing companies. If anything we should be looking at \textbf{gender} roles. Which splits and ends the conversation on personal opinion. For starters, our genders influence greatly what you and I do differently and companies are simply exploiting that. But to say that it is wrong for genders to influence our interests and hobbies is leftist bullshit and a bad excuse to dilute natural interests. Not to say that men or women are genetically entitled to "owning" certain hobbies but they will be more naturally inclined to lean towards certain areas and naturally hold a majority voice. To actively seek and "balance out" these stereotypes in the name of the other \textbf{gender} would be like petitioning to sell veggie burgers in In-N-Out in the name of vegetarians. And if you really want to conflate it on a broader scope, you can apply the same thing with the lack of women in STEM jobs. I don't believe more women should be in STEM jobs because everything should be 50-50, that would be self-serving political intent. Rather, I believe they should be in STEM jobs if they wish to. And well, being a \textbf{woman} naturally changes and makes decisions gravitate towards nurturing and/or jobs that allow women to raise children. That's not a sexist conjecture, that's a cold hard fact. \textbf{Gender} roles go back as far as hunters and gatherers where both parties optimized their survival based on the advantages their genders gave them.Nowadays we are applying political correctness to bridge the gap between \textbf{gender} influenced interests but this actually hurts the native side as it requires change to appease the other party, which are not naturally interested in the first place.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Brojn H On the market bit. I'm not saying companies that sell artistic products have a hidden political agenda, I'm saying they are not free from being influenced by politics, ideology, fads and reactions; spreading them in turn. Artists are fucking sponges for that shit, and nowadays we usually train our craft in tightly closed pop-culture bubbles in order to become highly specialized, competitive professionals. So we usually create and spread more pop culture imaginary and ideology in turn. Society influences art, which influences society in turn, and so on.Markets are complex ecosystems where a butterfly may stir hurricanes, so to speak. When I say governed by personal interest, I'm referring for example to the artificial manipulation of Euribor index the EU commission just found the leaders of some financial entities guilty of. That single action rocked the real state and financial markets in the EU; influenced politics in the south; affected many people's lives etc. Markets, culture, education and politics are interconnected by this current of neo liberalism that states the globalized world and all that it contains is a big marketplace where everything may be bought and sold; in a "if God doesn't exist, everything is permitted" fashion.  So you are made to think you are the all-mighty client, and "producers" or "creatives" are there to serve you; when in truth most of us are just here to be milked and exploited as consumers, workers or entrepreneurs by capital interests like the above. This ideology may look as "\textbf{common} sense" today; but comes as consequence of the political tactics implemented in the Reagan-Thatcher period: deregulation of financial sectors, privatization of public services tightly related with citizens fundamental rights, debilitation of trade unions, marketing and repackaging of civil rights movements (like feminism) or subversive cultural movements (like punk)  by the giants in fashion and entertaiment industries, etc. But it didn't even began with Thatcher and Reagan; this was just a continuation on the post-war repressive policies that were aimed to make women return back to their homes, and stay there as the CEOs of the family (Betty Friedan), plus the policies implemented in order to prevent "leftist" thought from spreading; thus protecting the Lockean conception of freedom vs the "commies".Propaganda campaigns were and are being orchestrated in order to manipulate public opinion, and most authors start as public themselves; that's why I refereed you to Bernays's work: it was the base for all we know as marketing and propaganda; from Goebbels's to sponsored content. He developed his work based on that of his uncle's, Sigmund Freud; which in turn was the father of the study of sexuality in relation to genre and clinical psychology; and whose theories we should have been able to surpass long ago thanks to experimental psychology and neuroscience; but paragraphs like yours demonstrate we have not. Hardly your fault, again, this has been chiseled into popular culture long ago by many artistic movements and postmodern authors.These "natural inclinations" you talk about aren't so; they are just the convenient explanation some men had for this structural oppression of women They weren't even called "natural" until baroque philosophy, before these "natural inclinations" were "God's plan for women" (again, dictated by male religious authorities; by men and not God) . Freud sympathized with Arthur Schopenhauer's though; which came to say Nature was just a cycle of \textbf{sex} and death, and Nature's plan for men was to make them rational and intelligent in order to achieve knowledge; but nature's plan for women was to make them attractive in order to get what they wanted from men: marriage and financial security (note how for Schopenhauer Nature's plan for women involves religion and economy?). Which again, entwines with the widely accepted conception at the time that women were governed by their uterus (hysteros in greek, that's were "hysterical" comes from) and men by their brains. And the christian notion of genesis and original sin, plus the protestan notion that each man is a representative of God, but most women are just succubus-like incarnations of the devil; that men have desires, while women ARE desire. This all have been reactionary ideas that seeked to maintain male domination in times of political and social changes leading to the recognition of more individual freedoms. Darwin himself said the proof that men were more intelligent than women could be extracted from the fact that few women had made contributions to occidental science; overlooking the fact that women who weren't allowed to study science, could hardly contribute to it. Same with games. I never had a game console growing up; in fact I saved for a year to buy a gameboy pocket and my parents took it away from me because "videogames aren't for girls". Like me, hundreds and thousands of little girls weren't even given the chance to try videogames back in the day, they were given barbies and dressed up as princesses instead. And now you do another "Darwin" and attribute to "natural inclination" what only comes as consequence of discriminatory treatment....Which brings me the the quota thing. Look here, 50 quotas are a parity measure; not "positive discrimination". We are half of humanity, in case you didn't noticed. Positive discrimination is when someone gives you something you do not have because you have some handicap. You cannot consider half of humanity handicaped, no matter how opressed they are by the other half, because "humanity" as concept cannot be male or female, \textbf{black} or white, left or right; but both and none. Go figure. So, if I was \textbf{disabled}, and I wanted to get into a public administration job, I would get in with lower qualifications because 10 of the spots are reserved for people with disabilities; and that's positive discrimination. But in the case of women we find out that, with the same tiles and qualifications as men; they still get kicked out of elites and not admitted into certain fields. On the other hand they are systemically being swayed and pushed towards retrograde decorative and \textbf{sexual} roles in blooming new industries, while still being generally regarded as caretakers and male helpers. In my country, women make up to 60 of university students. They graduate in less years and generally with better qualifications than their male counterparts. But in contrast to what one might expect, the presence of women in the grand staff is around 2 in the public financial powers, 4 in the case of public media, close to 5 in public academies and institutions of knowledge; insignificant in creativity and genius support from public institutions; and simply 0 in religious power elites. In politics, which may be the most transparent of those powers, even tho all parties must meet parity quotas, women are systemically being relegated to secondary places; questioned and mocked for no other reason than being women by the press and the public. On the gaming field? refer to this comment section or the video above for a taste of what we have to endure. Natural inclination has \textbf{nothing} to do with this, this is the good \textbf{old} discrimination we know so well; thank you very much. This is asking women to prove themselves much harder in order to obtain much less. This "meritocracy" is bullshit. If we are politically equal, with the same rights and citizenship as men; yet that doesn't translate in an proportional distribution of spaces and power; it's obvious that this system is biased somewhere. This is not what equal rights and opportunities stands for, this is a quimera in which desires are marketed as rights and freedoms even against the democratic values and ideas we have to thank for our fundamental rights and freedoms. This is a mirage in which the ample majority of society believes the genres are politically equal as fact that doesn't need to be proven anymore. That \textbf{sexism} existed in the past because people didn't knew any better; but now (without knowing exactly how) society has been liberated from all \textbf{old} prejudices and accepted women as equal. And the result is the distribution of spaces, roles and powers we have today. 2, 4, 5, 0 for more than 50 of the population.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Ben Carter Women are not preventing men form getting higher education by holding to the matriarcal institutions anywhere in the world that I know of, in fact I'm positive that is men who are forbidding superior education for women in many parts of the world today. Women are that 60  of students in my country because they try harder to get the title; because they know they NEED it more than men, and probably because university here is "affordable". If superior studies where as expensive as in USA, I highly doubt female students would surpass male students... 70 of the people living under the line of poverty in my country are women, they also earn about 20 less for the same job and tile; so no, I don't think men are being "left out", or don't graduate because life is harder for them. Social engineering? Quota laws and parity electoral system have been working from quite some time now in many American and European democracies. The legislators, ethicists and political scientists that created those laws understood that, for institutions and public powers to be representative of the will of the people, the people in the institutions should be representative of the people in the country, go figure. The idea being that is impossible for democratic institutions to represent  the female population if the female population itself isn't present at the institutions; and also the idea that it is their right as citizens to have the same access to whatever is PUBLIC. Because we are better prepared and going to do better than men? No, because we are half of society, PUBLIC institutions belong to society and so It is our right to be given the chance to do just as good or as bad as the men in them.  Call that "social engineering" if you want; but imho that term applies better to the educational and cultural processes by which women and men are raised to accept \textbf{sexism} as "the way things are"; and later end up calling this interiorized conditioning "free choice", "consent" or "equality". Are there worse forms of "social engineering" out there than literal mind programing from birth based on our \textbf{sex}? Is there any bigger attack on individual freedom than that which is inflicted upon the minds of the citizens without their knowledge and consent?You talk big about taking responsibility; but the thing is responsibility is undividable from power and freedom; because without power there's no freedom; and without freedom there's no such thing as "choice".\textbf{Sex} in not a choice; yet is going to determine the power and freedom you can hope for. It's funny how women are prevented from reaching power, how society restricts their freedom; and still they are held responsible for \textbf{sexism} and blamed for the violence they suffer. Curious how many victims are blamed or end up blaming themselves; while the perpetrators boast about their deeds and power instead of "taking responsibility". When is gonna be enough, I ask you?

Some people can't cope and end up sitting in the street(mostly middle aged white men strangely).

I feel no ill will toward you but I find your certainty unsettling as I would not want to speak for others as for their intentions or the amount of liberty an individual has. The advocacy for women specifically in the west is now a multi billion dollar industry with lobbying power.

Women come off worse no doubt accounted by physical size difference.

So violence is a complicated and entirely statistically non gendered issue. Yet \textbf{woman} get overwhelming legal protections from men and this exists in every western country. So the concern for me is the recognition of female violence which men rarely report because the system already steps on men hard who transgress.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I get you are saying that "she should allow discussion because it's valuable, despite the assholes". And I'm with you that it is a disgrace when discussion is banned, but one must understand the reason of the banning if one aspires to lift these bans eventually. Discussion is valuable because it is powerful, and in that targeted channel the discussion is dominated entirely by some who are using it's power to cater to the lowest instincts and irrational fears of the audience. I'm afraid you are not taking into account the ramifications and consequences of the actions of those assholes. Because, even if those assholes are traumatized and unsupervised kids drunk with power living in their internet microcosmos (Obnoxious rings a bell?) their actions and speech have real- life consequences.  Internet imitates society imitates internet, and so on.Those assholes have an audience, like every bully who ever lived; and the most dedicated members of the audience aspire to get the same likes, attention or recognition as the bullies on top by some radical action. And so the cicle continues, and new bullies are recruited into the cult, using MRA, journalism integrity or whatever as bait.  Most of them are not fucked- up double faced individuals to begin with; they start going down that road when they start thinking their ideals justifies the means.  Along comes fear and paranoia; and the feminazis become the new \textbf{Communist}, Illuminati, Freemason or whatever in their minds. Then all feminist are a feminazis. Then all women.These bullies deeply believe they are the victims, the punishers or the Saviors; and the only ones able to see through the female conspiracy tale that lured them in. Add to the mix the sexist conceptions we all grew up with, a butt-hurt ex-boyfriend as spiritual leader, some teens that pride themselves "real gamers" meaning "lack a real life social interaction experience", some major companies bowing down to those teens, and a few media eager to generate views and profit on the controversy; then you can see how this internet cult spreads like wildfire when not contained.That's why some feminist videos choose not to allow comments, in order to not further fuel those fires. And is not just Sharkeshian. Search "imagine a world where being \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} was the norm" and then "oppressed majority" on youtube. Two short films that are practically identical in form, using the same visual and story telling resources to challenge views on sexuality and \textbf{gender} roles. Yet on the homosexuality video you have thoughtful discussion and tons of support comments. The \textbf{gender} video? No comments allowed. Honestly, it pains me to see how people are unwilling to rethink and discuss their stances on \textbf{gender},  specially because they show they can do it when it comes to \textbf{race} or \textbf{sexual} orientation. But I'm not gonna blame it on the ones taking all the heat, and still trying to speak up and challenge people's perceptions.    When Anita has tried to go to video game events to discuss these issues live with the audience, the assholes responded with bomb threats if she attended (because freedom of speech, you know), and the organization gave in and dropped her panel not wanting to compromise security.  Those assholes are forcing her and her family to leave their homes with constant death threats. Not to mention the doxing, the stalking, the efforts to ruin her career and so on. The only reason we can be talking somewhat nicely in here it is because the one talking about \textbf{sexism} and games is a man. I wish  Sharkeshian was a rare exception, but the criminal treatment dispensed to her and Zoe Quinn has pretty much become the standard treatment for any feminist \textbf{woman} that  gets some attention on the internet (and some man that speak in their favor... remember FEZ creator?).  ...which brings me to the notion +Chief has introduced. I'm gonna argue that the imbalance in internet usage by men and women can be explained by comparing it with the imbalance in the job market and society in general. But when it comes to the internet, there's also the fear component to account for. \textbf{Woman} learn pretty soon to hide their \textbf{gender} online in order to avoid random hate or \textbf{sexual} objectification. They learn that they can be stalked or harassed and have their intimate life exposed.They sadly learn that, if that happens, they will be blamed for not being careful or prude enough, trusting the wrong person or pissing off the wrong people. That free speech is usually invoked to protect the men who are putting them down, but few of those men are willing or prepared to face the consequences of their freedom and their speech. They learn they can only interact safely in the traditional "girl" spaces,  and most of those just aim at teaching them how to be attractive, useful and decorative to lure men.  A society that tells half of it's population that they are all free an equal in theory, but they have to fear for their security if they decide to live as the other half is not a free society. Is a society that teaches  half of it's population that they are too weak to live with freedom. Is a society that does so because it is necessary in order to keep both genders \textbf{dumb}, divided and mindlessly consuming sexist crap.See how ideas can flow when you don't need to surf past insults to read them?  Let's not dismiss the male chauvinistic assholes so easily,  because it is because of those loud assholes that \textbf{woman} are afraid to voice their opinions and interact on the internet. Those assholes are the ones who convince them that all men on the internet are assholes,  because they are getting all the loud pissed-off assholes while the rest of us watch and eat popcorn. It is because of those assholes that we can't have nice things. But it is because of our silence that those assholes keep sprouting and convincing themselves they are heroes fighting for their oppressed brothers.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Communist, Dumb, Gay, Gender, Race, Sexism, Sexual, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments, Sexual Identity - General, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality & \cellcolor{green!5}15/1012 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.482 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I don't know where did you got that  she avoids debate for fear. Debate is closed for preventing hate speech from spreading, no more, no less. We could debate more on the very definition or free speech vs hate speech, comparing this case with others like the Brandenburg v. Ohio; but that's not the issue. She doesn't need to prove she can refute every single argument made against her, what kind of crap is that? Not only because most of the arguments made against her stances, feminism or \textbf{woman} are stereotypical, biased, or so uninformed that don't deserved to the dignified with an answer in the first place. She doesn't need to explain her position because she already does videos doing just that, go figure. If you want to close your eyes to \textbf{sexism} in games be my guest. If you are worried about the issues but still you think she is exaggerating  and women don't have it so hard; you can contrast the data and opinions proposed by Anita elsewhere (like here for example). But take a moment to realize how differently we treat women vs men. Because she is a feminist \textbf{woman} in games context, she needs to refute any argument and prove that games are indeed misogynistic.  Do you demand the same from her detractors, do you ask them to prove how she's wrong, or do simply accept their ad hominem explanations? What about other influential men and women? Do you demand your boss, your tv stars, or even your politicians to publicly justify their every action and refute every single argument or opinion hurled against them? What makes Anita more dangerous or influential than Obama, that she needs to explain and justify her every word and action to prove she's right? No human being is 100 right all the time. A feminist \textbf{woman} needs to be held to a higher moral standard than the rest in order to fight for her rights? Bullshit. Anyone saying that is just searching for an excuse to discredit her so they can keep ignoring sexist behavior.Anita herself is making modest changes at best, in truth is mainly all the hate directed towards her that is proving and exposing how sexist the industry, the internet and the society really are. It is because all the hate that people learn who she is and listen to what she says in the first place. Is all this stupid hate that is causing the women who still believed they were equal to wake up and worry about these issues for the first time. Men are waking up realizing also for the fist time that carrying yourself in life with a stupid boy's club attitude hurts the women you know and love, and your chances of developing a true connection with them eventually.The very fact that she can't allow comments in in her videos speaks volumes.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Sexism, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}4/482 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.83 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small No I am sorry. I can´t agree to this. First of most of the people who criticize games aren´t even interested in games. They are pushing a narrative of feminism. That he loves gaming does mitigate some of this. And while games might be sexist, does in no way make gamers sexist. There is no evidence of this. The same discussion was had over the violence in Mortal Kombat in 1994 to no avail. Violence has been on a steady decline since then and this is the same thing.What feminist often are saying is that things need to change and it needs to change NOW! Now consider the fact that attacking one of men´s and women´s favorite pass times and calling them sexist, \textbf{racist} or \textbf{homophobic} because they play games does \textbf{NOTHING}, absolutely \textbf{nothing} for change in video games.Consider the boiling of a \textbf{frog}. Do it gradually and the \textbf{frog} doesn't notice. But put the heat on max and it will try to escape.Look at the latest polls. Majority of gamers, both men and women, have no problem with identifying with a character because of \textbf{gender}, class, racer or what ever, as long as the character is well written.Back to the main concern here. And this is my main point. I love video games. Have played them all my life. Even violent and sexy games that sometimes are harmful to the pixilated characters. None of this has EVER made me treat anyone badly and I doubt that it would be different for most gamers. Sure, sexist exists and and they will continue to do so, whether you change games or not.And trolls will always exist. They do not represent gamers as a whole. they only want to spark controversy. They are just as hated by gamers (or perhaps even more) just because they make conversations very hard.So in conclusion. Calling all gamers sexist, \textbf{racist} and homophobes will only spark anger, rightful anger in my book.And trying to ban games that you don´t even play for one reason or another is only going to do the same.You can have your opinions about everything and that is fine, but leave stuff that you don´t care about alone.Gamers are people too and should be treated as such.There has never been a more diverse group of people that like the same thing in the history of the world.So let things run their course. With more women playing games, the developers will come around, because they like the big green wads of cash. Forcing them to change is not the way to handle this.So with that said. I have been civil and factual here.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I guess my point is that when the average human thinks of AAA game characters, they think guys: Super Mario, Master Chief, GTA series, Witcher, GoW, God of War, etc. Obviously there are indie games or smaller titles with some sort of female character but that's not part of my point.Game developers of larger franchises almost always paint their women with the male gaze - you either have to protect them from/with your male protag, or their costumed in such an impractical way as to cater to the male eye. FFX-2 in particular is infamous for it's squeaky scantily clad ladies giggling their way through a love story. You would never see a AAA title risk its budget positioning a \textbf{woman} the same way they would Master Chief - an unequivocal badass whose character development doesn't require a love interest or starting from a weak place.

You actually try to identify with the characters in the games you play? These are fictional people whose only job is set dressing for your gameplay experience. Whether it's a protagonist or an NPC, a game puts gameplay before storyline. You're not expected to identify with anyone. Do you think we men seriously want to identify with a criminal in GTA, or a US colonialist gun in Just Cause, or an adventurer in a fictional setting like in Zelda?Here's a bit of wisdom for you. I don't identify with any of the protagonists I have played with. Every protagonist could be female for all I care it's mainly about the game. The other reason why games like Halo have chief males? Because as per in real life and around us, men take up jobs like soldiers, commanders, henchmen, drug lords, criminals etc. I'm pretty sure that if the crime statistics were balanced and more women were seen committing the same level of heinous crime we'd have no problem imagining a female in GTA. But what do we know, maybe then everyone would be like "OMG they put a \textbf{woman} in this game where she gets shot at. Violence against women".Also, what's the deal with being sexy? It's like the female \textbf{gender} is completely aversive to the idea of sexiness and beauty for women. I'm not saying that I'd take offence to some games with female protagonists having sexy men in thongs. Go ahead and do it, game devs. Some eye candy for the female gaze. News flash: A lot of women do like to put on sexy skimpy armor even in RPGs when playing online, because they'd never do it IRL.

Speaking as a \textbf{woman}, I think the biggest thing I have a problem with is that there are imbalances of how characters are portrayed in video games. I don't usually have a problem with female characters who look or act unrealistic when a male character is equally as ridiculous. Let me put things in perspective. If there was a video game where a \textbf{woman} is fully clothed while the guy was half naked and his muscles/junk were moving in an unrealistic way while they were in battle, you probably wouldn't play the game and I wouldn't blame a guy for not wanting to. Imagine if a bulk of video games were like that. I know I'm over exaggerating, but I think you get my point. It would probably piss guys off. I probably would be a casual gamer if there were more games that didn't have that "boys only" feel to it. By the way, I have no problem when games target towards certain people, but I would like to find games that have characters I could relate to more frequently then I am now.

Differences in their "brain road maps" (scientifically known as "the connectome") can explain why males outperform females on certain tests of \textbf{mental} skills, while females have the edge in others. We know that hormones influence brain development in the womb, yet before \textbf{age} 13, boys' and girls' \textbf{mental} circuitry appears similar. During puberty, hormones may again have a powerful effect and contribute to rewriting the teen brain.It turned out that maybe 6 in every 100 of the brains they studied were consistently a single \textbf{sex}. Many others had a patchwork quilt of masculine and feminine features that varied widely from person to person.Women have more connections going left and right across the two halves of the brain. This could give them an advantage in pulling together information from different sources and drawing conclusions. The left half of the brain handles logical thinking, and the right is associated with intuition.Men's brains have more connections from front to back, which may heighten their perception. They may be more attuned to what's going on around them so they can take action. Men have stronger connections between brain areas for motor and spatial skills. That means males tend to do a better job at tasks that need hand-eye coordination and understanding where objects are in space, such as throwing a ball or hammering a nail.MRIs showed the biggest gaps between the sexes were the larger amount of gray matter women had in their hippocampus, a structure that plays a role in memory, and the left caudate, which is thought to control our communication skills. Verma found that in female brains, there's more wiring in regions linked to memory and social cognition. So is it surprising that women tend to be better at understanding how other people are feeling and knowing the right way to respond in social situations?When your brain processes the same signals over and over, those networks will get stronger, like working out a muscle. So even if male and female brains start out similar, they may become different over time as boys and girls are treated differently with different expectations.''It confirms that \textbf{gender} is partially a social construct, but not completely. I believe just that.Other source: ''with 50 percent of men and 48 percent of women saying they played video games on a console, PC, or handheld device. Despite this, men are much more likely to self-identify as "gamers" than their female counterparts, and both men and women generally assume that most video game players are men.''I couldn't find a source that gave exact numbers about casual vs. hardcore female gamers.

Then again, parents generally don't like the idea of their kid being a gamer and most gamers are adults anyway. The fact remains that most blockbuster titles depict violence and often muddy dark colors. Girls generally not liking those things is a way bigger and more complicated issue than just gaming and in the end it doesn't even matter.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small +Sophie Sanderfer This was quite intersting to read through. First of, i'm not trying to attack you here, but i noticed that you dismissed pretty much all of Juventins points and you never brought any evidence for your claims and you saw him as part of this "problem" which i find ridiculous. Most gamers don't care what \textbf{gender} the character has or colour, what matters is if the game is any good or the story for that matter. But you seem to be offended if you have to play as a white male character and i personally find that to be actually "problematic". Do you really think GTAV would have been a better game if a female character was in the lead? The answer is no, it would be the same game. But here is the thing, the writers of Rockstar created the story of this game with these characters in mind and its their right to do so. If they forced a female lead character into the story which they constructed just to please feminists then they would have to rewrite everything and the narrative would have suffered. Of course if the story was written with a female lead in mind from the very beginning then thats something completely different. But look at Ubisoft, they really tried to satisfy the feminst audience by forcing this inclusivity into their games and then they got even more critizied for it by them. Its always a lose-lose situation because they never will be satisfied, they find always something to complain about. Lots of AAA games are catered to a male audience (world wide btw, make from that info what you will), thats because in this gaming sector most of the audience is male. Saying 50 of gamers are female is dishonest because these numbers also take mobile gaming into account and these people wouldn't be really interested in blockbuster gaming anyway and thats just the reality of it. But to say there are almost no games with great female leads is simply not true because there are so many out there and that makes me believe you don't play many games in the first place. For every game you show me which has a white male protagonist i can show you 10 more games with great female leads. If you actually look into the medium then you will see there is no problem. But if you really think there is then do as Joventis said and make your own games. Everyone can express and create what they want and thats so great about the medium and art in general. But not all games are for everyone just like movies and music and thats absolutely ok. If you want to force everything so it appeals for you is imo cencorship and against freedom of speach. If you don't like a game because the content offends you then play something else because there is plenty to choose from.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/494 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.202 \\  \hline

Basically every single one of those protagonists is a gang member, or a former gang member.  I'm not saying that they shouldn't make games like these anymore, because those stories still exist and should be told, but wouldn't it be nice if there was a playable \textbf{black} main protagonist in a fantasy, mystery or a sci-fi game, as opposed to just the usual default white male?? There is a lot of misdirected anger right now towards feminism by other vulnerable communities, but in reality what they are talking about is promoting equality and better representation for all groups, including the \textbf{black} community.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small +(\&quot;RNA0ROGER\&quot;) So why can't I, as a \textbf{woman}, have access to a popular game which treats men in the same way GTAV treats women? Why can't I pick up, beat up and pay for \textbf{sex} from scantily clad, poorly written, non satirical male background characters, while playing as a properly dressed, well written female lead character? Sure games are escapism, and they allow for the acting out of fantasies without consequences, but that in no way means that they aren't, or should be, overly sexist. Personally, I play games for the story aspect, but always, while playing older games, such as Pokemon, I pretended the main player character was female. I love how games such as Skyrim allow for male and female main player characters, and have a lesser level of \textbf{sexism} in their non player characters, depicting the women with functional armour and non skimpy clothing. As a \textbf{woman}, I am a market for the gaming industry, not just for meaningless puzzle games, but for games with in-depth storylines and characterisation. Popular games should not be made exclusively for men or a male audience. Lets be clear that I don't want non gendered, non explicit games, I want violent, gory, story-centric games with the scope to allow for many playstyles, without women being depicted as objects. Unless, of course, male characters are equally depicted as objects in humiliating and dehumanising situations, such as the situations for women in GTAV. And I do not believe this is an reasonable demand. If the developer would not put a male character in that situation, they should not be putting a female character in that situation.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Sex, Sexism, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}4/273 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.465 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Edwardy YvettiYetiThere is an \textbf{old} saying if it ain't broke don't fix it. For most of the gaming industry especially Rockstar what they have works. GTA 5 sold so well it broke records, that is to say the least a functional set ideas for a business and the consumer loves it. Thus they vote with their wallets and win the election. Games are a product and they are tailored to whoever buys them. Many men hold the view that the term \textbf{sexism} is a buzz word rather than a meaningful criticism of media. Then there are the ones that simply do not care, for this reason I paid full price for the pre release of GTA 5. I take no issue with any part of the game and I see no reason to. It is what I like and thus it is what I buy. But in all honesty I could write about my own feelings all day. But rather than doing that I will give you advice and little bit of encouragement. It is clear to me that you do not like games as they are, frankly to each their own. But as a bit of a spoiler the game industry isn't really going to change that much over the next few decades. People have tried to make innovations and to do things differently, valve tried doing exactly that. The portal series was created and it was a success. But compared to Counter Strike \& Half Life it was a complete failure. Then Valve did what all businesses do go where the money is and that was CS and HL. But as you said you are a market and I am certain there are many women like yourself that share these views. So I would suggest you follow in the footsteps of Elon Musk and create a product. You see a problem and you have a demographic, so like Elon did make a product to appeal to people like you. If you want games to change you need to make one, incorporate your ideas and produce a product and be successful. Because if you don't the next \textbf{woman} most likely won't, in fact if you won't then I think the answer to the question is really quite clear. Because you won't and many women won't, you say you want change but you don't create that very change. But who know I might be wrong, if I am I will gladly review the product you have created. In the end if you want change then a game is the best argument for that change few women have risen to the challenge. However you can put your ideas to the ultimate test.Please do so\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Old, Sexism, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/455 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.659 \\  \hline

Sure but that doesn't mean that the gamer creators are \textbf{racist} or sexist. People who make games usually make them to resemble themselves. Equal representation would be awesome but blatantly calling someone a \textbf{racist} or sexist because they don't show you in a game is going a little too far. Sometimes all it takes is saying hey I'm here as a whole community. Obvious GTA in it self it completely satirical i also didn't fail to mention how he as most white feminists do seem to completely leave out the \textbf{racism} which almost always goes hand in hand with \textbf{sexism}. Not to mention the use of trolls as his evidence for \textbf{sexism}. Honesty never felt a big problem with GTA other than it being boring as fuck and the \textbf{racism} which still isn't enough for me to honestly give the game shit reviews just because the game doesn't paint me skin color in the best light. Also back to the sexist thing most of the characters are minorities and he didn't really seem to sya anything about that but the gorgeous blond white model must be a victim of \textbf{sexism}. If that's the case any female pop star right now is sexist against herself. A simple call for more representation without all the bashing or gamers and game designers would have been great.

You complain about the same thing but as a "white looking" women you are in the same boat as the people you are accusing, their is more then enough representation of you too. Just like we minorities are always told if we want representation we have to create it ourselves. Not to mention the developers are going to make things that are going to sell.

First off, he's criticizing this one game as sexist, and then pointing out that the \textbf{sexism} of the community is clear in people's response to even light criticism about the portrayal of women. Guys, he loves gaming. He literally just said that you have to care about something to speak at length about it, and he's a game critic. He loves games, and he's not attacking them. He's suggesting how video games can be even better. Don't be satisfied with the status quo-- games are an interactive storytelling artform and I love them for that, and art has critics and critics make art better. It's okay to acknowledge something isn't perfect and still love it. You can still enjoy a game that's sexist for its other features-- GTA is /fun/. Nobody's denying that. When critics say GTA is sexist, it's not a personal attack against you for liking it. And I think that's the problem with the gaming community when it responds to accusations of \textbf{sexism} in games: the guys don't /want to be seen as sexist, so they insist that their games aren't, because they take the criticism as an attack on them for liking it. And then, feeling like they've been personally attacked, they get defensive. Which, in the end, makes them look even more sexist. Acknowledge that there's problems, guys. Love games anyways, but just acknowledging that the problem exists is the first, and most key, step to those problems going away.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/273 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.733 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small +MegaKaitouKID1412 Thank god there are some non hateful comments!I personally think GTAV was a bad example because it seems to me that it represents a social environment that is sexist. And so to me it is a rightful choice to put that \textbf{sexism} on purpose in the game. But whatever, he could have taken other examples that illustrate well \textbf{sexism} in videogames, i guess gtaV is a game everyone has heard about and so it has a bigger impact in his speech.I really hope the silent majority that watched the video doesn't agree with all those harsh coments...(pls excuse my bad english if i made mistakes, it's not my mother tongue)\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Sexism & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/114 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.754 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Shivolk I think the \textbf{sexism} in the community wasn't just demonstrated in the game's content itself-- which, honestly, yes, in some points is very justifiable, though it could still have been handled and balanced better than it was*-- but also largely in the community's reaction to any criticisms regarding the subject. Like I said, I suspect it's a defensive thing rather than intend to offend, but defending these things and ignoring their problems is infinitely worse than saying, "Yeah, you're right-- but I still like playing it." *Footnote: Honestly, I think there's very little excuse for a sandbox-type game not to have the option for the lead to be female, simply because male players do use that option too (especially in third-person gameplay games where the guy gets to look at his character moving-- not that I'm judging or that there's anything wrong with that, just making an observation). Just having the option for the main character to be male or female and experience the same story offers something a little deeper than the women-purely-as-objects-and-eyecandy, even if those female player character options still do serve as eyecandy. Given, I haven't played /this GTA, so I don't know if it has this or not for sure, but it sure sounds like it doesn't, so.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/213 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.469 \\  \hline

But they could have balanced it better maybe, i don't know.About the community... well yeah, he's quite right and i totally agree with your interpretation. And it's a shame, really, that we don't seem to be able to take criticism. Since everything is happining on internet, i hope the majority of people act like i (almost) always do: sigh and doesn't comment or upvote, but know that the top comments are stupid.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I honestly don't think it's sexist. There may not be playable female characters for the story mode but I didn't really expect it. It's played predominately by men and has been marketed to men (or lesbians arguably.. but to be fair, not really) and sure, they could've added a playable female, but I don't find it sexist that they didn't nor did I feel that the game was lacking because of it.On female portrayal, I'm not surprised that they are ridiculous, but the hacker you can bring on heists, the random occurrence Antonia Bottino, Tanisha Marks and Molly Schultz are all examples of female characters who are pretty regular, believable characters even if their parts are small, but at the very least it can't be said that all the females in GTA 5 are sexist stereotypes. And the blatant \textbf{sexism} was satire.. so, those are my thoughts, as the obligatory gamergate rep :D\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/154 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.649 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small +Diil Avery I agree with you, as i said, GTA is also about the story and they don't need to put a female character in story mode if it's not a story they want to tell. The game is indeed inteded for men, and i guess we can think of the blatant \textbf{sexism} as satire, or as a representation of the \textbf{sexism} in this environment. GTA is a great game and i wouldn't really want it to change honestly, but i understand someone could see it as sexist. Now, is it really that bad for a game to be sexist? I mean, admitting a game IS sexist, then what? many games are violent, it doesn't mean they make people violent. And i think sexist games doesn't make people sexist, so if you find it funny to have a game where boobs bounce well, why not? Women aren't forced to play it. But in the review of the game, the critic can say he finds the game sexist, so the people reading this will know, and maybe some girls that wanted to play it will not. He can even take 1point away and give it a 9/10 and not a 10/10 because for him, the \textbf{sexism} is a -. Then what? You can still play and enjoy it, even if it's got a 9/10 and is considered sexist by some.I just hope people could change a bit of mentality. You can very well accept a game can be considered sexist and not insult the guy who said that, even if you don't agree. (as you just did, and that is nice :D)On the other hand i hope he doesn't mean to "destroy" those games and put an end to all sexist games. But I don't think so, if he still gives a 9/10 to GTA.I hope i have not annoyed you with all that text and you've read it all hahah, have a good day sir!just a last thought:in cinema Transformers is considered by many as sexist, and there's no problem with that. it's targeted for men, and it ends here.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Sexism & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/354 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.847 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Shivolk Agreed, and even if it's not necessarily a product of \textbf{sexism} there will be people who find the humour in the game offensive and they are perfectly entitled to that.Yeah, I don't think it's bad if a game is sexist and if it went as far as the developers admitting that it contains \textbf{sexism} then, so what?But if I was to put myself in his shoes I think the point I would like to make is that there is a difference between consciously making \textbf{sexism} a theme and inadvertently making the game sexist and I'm sure if he thought about it for a bit that's what he might want to argue... but like you said, it hasn't been proven that games make us violent nor has it been proven that games make us sexist, so the research wouldn't be on his side. As always, my opinion is, if you don't like something, don't try and get it banned. Just don't give them your money and we can all game in peace :D Yeah I wish people wouldn't be so shitty. I've done it too before so I can't talk, but it really doesn't help and people lashing back against the criticism are just being screenshot and used as further examples of "how the gaming community is hostile to women" :DCan't argue with Megan Fox on screen :D\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/231 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.299 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small +Diil Avery Sorry did I miss something? Is someone trying to ban these types of games?I think it is important to aknowlage that a game is sexist if thats what it is. As you have said, we allow the same treatment of games for all other criteria, why not be able to talk about \textbf{sexism} in it?Being able to like even love something and still be avare of its flaws and criticize it is a very basic human thing. I also think that having a conversation about it and being able to criticize a game for it is a necessary step to moving forward. And by moving forward I dont mean lets never make a game like GTA, I mean having more variety in games. There are so many games out there in which \textbf{nothing} in the lines of gameplay or storytelling would change if the protagonist was female. I personally also never saw  a gamer that didnt play a game simply because it was a female character, hell, I know a lot of men who choose to play as females if the choice is given to them. I dont think the argument of ''just dont play and dont give them your money'' is enough though. We need to have this conversation and support the companies to do other stuff too. Lets be honest, the companies that make the big games and have the biggest profits right now, are going to be scared to lose money by trying something different. Having a conversation might make them see that maybe making a game that doesnt follow these things so closely wont lose them money. Its the same argument that was had about movies, and to some extent it still is. When the conversation about all male protagonists in movies started, everyone believed it was the only way to make money, that thats ''simply what people want'', that people wouldnt want to watch women in lead roles and that was reserved for chick-flicks. But then we had some of the top box office films like Burtons Alice, Gravity, Hunger games etc. And lastly I think its pretty lazy, while I like the sexy female characters as much as anyone, I would just love to see some more interesting design. And having sexy half naked women doesnt grant much in design. If the idea is she has to be conventionaly hot, and have the least clothes possible you will end up with very little you can do, in terms of physical appearance and clothing design. Example, I love the way Aveline form assasins creed looks like, and I think we can agree her costume would be a lot less interesting if she was half naked, just well, for the sheer lack of something to work with. And considering all the female characters have to be young it ends up being much of the same. Again Im not saying lets not have sexy women in tight (or very little clothing) ever again, Im just saying more variety in character design would be fun.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nothing, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/511 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.391 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small +MegaKaitouKID1412 Before I say anything else, I agree with him on the fact that it would be helpful to make more female leads, my problem is how he stereotypes the gaming community at large.But his descriptions of gamers ARE personal attacks, how he describes the counter arguments, describes gamers as smelly and shaking their fists. He puts a bunch of quotes from obvious trolls and treats them as the beliefs as gamers as a whole. This guy is as sexist towards other men as he claims gamers are to women. He expects the whole industry and gamers as a whole to change their companies, past times and passions to fit a few new people coming in. Its not the problem the gaming community is sexist and just want to push women away and make it a boys club, its the fact SJWs are coming in, demanding that everyone bend their whim and conform to them and gamers feel attacked. Yes there are some people who are sitting in the corner like he said, shaking their fists, their called TROLLS, most gamers will welcome you if you want to work WITH them. SJWs want to command gamers to do what they want and gamers react. You know theres this thing you can do, its called "not buy the sexist videogaes". He also acts like all these guys are just getting along and then ganging up on women/girls who come in, thats stupid. I'm a man and I have been insulted, mocked and threatened on video games on line, and I know its just a few vocal trolls trying to get my goat. Heck, I have had rape threats on video games...some how trolls get a lot a real thrill from \textbf{homoerotic} shouting. I don't go crying and saying its about my \textbf{gender} or \textbf{race} (I'm white and I sound very stereotypical white) and I have been called the N word plenty of times on online games. Personally I just turn it around and start making fun of them and you can very often get the to leave. There are lots of women who turn off their head sets for voice chat when playing and I have heard that used as a way to prove that women are attacked in online gaming, but I have heard just as many men say they do it to.

Feminism rally with such anger against \textbf{sexism} and tells us is horribly wrong, but when we take the accusation of being sexist thrown at us seriously then you cry we're angry and misogynistic.

I'm sorry but someone who says GTA is sexist doesn't understand GTA, nor gaming. It's not enough that he's a game critic, that makes it worst. Seriously, feminists, you need to stop believing everything is sexist. Bad situations being referenced in a game in order to create tension, story and difficulty doesn't equate discriminating, nor encourage discrimination of any sort.By equating storytelling in media with discrimination your basically proposing censorship in order for us to be "correct" and not discriminate.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small +donklue Less than 20? Where are you getting your stats? Is this just from your encountering of women on online games? Because, I hate to tell you this, man, but a lot of girls hide their \textbf{gender} on online games to avoid issues. I've talked to girls who won't turn on their mic without a voice changer, use male avatars and neutral usernames, and in general, just pretend to be guys. Or stay offline completely. If I've got hundreds of hours in the single player campaign but haven't gone online, does that disclude me from being a "real" gamer because you can't see me doing it? Honestly, my local game store is staffed by about an equal amount of men and women, and has about equal division of customers at any given moment, too. I'll admit, I've not been to a convention, but, c'mon, games are expensive as it is! Haha. My point: individual experience isn't a good indicator of statistics. Don't rely on your perception.The other day I was playing a game-- online and very social in content, and one of the guys I'm playing with goes, "You know, I wish there were more girls on this game. There are so few." And I was really confused for a moment, because I hadn't noticed that at all. I thought that that particular game had more girls than guys. It just came off to me as a more girly game, and I was introduced to it with one of my female friends, but then I looked at the split of avatar genders, and realized that in most games, there /were more guys than girls.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I disagree with him slightly, on the subject of GTA V. Really, the same things he's accusing GTA V of could equally be said of the recent Tomb Raider game - the male characters in Tomb Raider have no agency, don't have any sort of character or story arc, etc. The fact is, the characters in GTA are bank robbers, and a trio of female bank robbers is not all that believable, because robbing banks is historically an overwhelmingly male pursuit. Still, it would have been nice if at least one of the characters had been a \textbf{woman}. In a game with more than two playable characters, it shows a complete lack of imagination when none of them are female.Also, on the statistic that 47 of gamers are women, so what? Even if only 10 of gamers were women, there should still be 50 of the playable characters being women, because that's the proportion of women to men in the world. The idea that male/female characters in videogames should match the proportions of gamers suggests that men can only play men and women can only play women. Just because I'm a man, that doesn't mean I can only control male characters in a video game - I can play quite happily while controlling a female character. The \textbf{sex} of the character isn't important, unless the player is 8 and thinks girls are icky. Surely we need to get beyond that ridiculous level of immaturity.Fortunately, the imbalance is starting to go away, a bit. At least we have Lara Croft, and we recently got Until Dawn, a game that has an equal mix of male and female characters, in which the women characters are generally more interesting than the men, which is a nice surprise. On the other hand, we still get games like Metal Gear Solid 5, with its female characters that seem to be \textbf{nothing} more than masturbation fantasies for teenaged boys.So there's a long way to go, and I'm glad to see someone so succinctly explaining the main issues faced by those of us who care about \textbf{gender} equality.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender, Nothing, Sex, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}4/354 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.13 \\  \hline

So is it any surprise that these developers are capitalizing on their demography's interests? Because guess what, when you have a fanbase consisting almost entirely of men, presenting some sexy ladies, cars, guns and action is a good way to get them interested. The same way if you have a female fanbase consisting of entirely women, presenting sexy men and celebrities, fashion and whatnot is a good way to get them interested.

And there's the type that values equality for all men and women, and that is really the most \textbf{common} type. Unfortunately, the former has the loudest voices, and thus it gets feminism in general a bad rep. In my viewpoint everyone should be feminist. Now, I'm not actually that annoyed by \textbf{sexism} in video games. It does exist to an extent, but it's hardly the most harming thing. No, what annoys me is seeing peoples reaction to women on the internet in general, and if people paid more attention, that was a major point the beardy hipster made.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Firstly, the are different degrees of feminism and misogynism. What I am saying though is that if you aren't sexist then you are a feminist. Most people seem to not quite understand that, feminism is basically just \textbf{gender} equality (in its simplest Form), and if you do not support it then you will be to a degree sexist, because you can't not be sexist and not be a feminist, looking at the true definition.    Now, I'm not entirely sure why you say that it's mostly male feminists who assault women. That's really suggesting that all women who get raped are by men who value equality for both sexes?  That doesn't really make sense. I don't doubt that there will be some people who declare themselves feminist and may still assault women. However, the majority will not be by people who consider themselves feminists. They will be by misogynists.  Also, I don't have a hate of \textbf{sex}, because that would mean I was asexual (I'm not, most people aren't). As I did state earlier, sexualisation in video games is not what annoys me. It's a clever marketing scheme, and there is a difference between sexualisation and \textbf{sexism}. That being said, I don't like it in games and I'd rather be without it in them, but if you do I won't be annoyed at you, just not hugely impressed. In terms of sexuality and stuff, I don't like it being put into games and films where it's gratuitous and unecessery, but that does not mean I hate it as a whole, so that point you make is a little invalid. Finally, as I stated before its the aggressive unpleasant misogynistic hating upon women who do anything that I can't stand. For example the ghostbusters trailer having the highest dislikes ever on YouTube. And that's the thing he brought up which is true in the video. It's the thing I experience every day. And it is that, along with the horrible way some men treat women, as though they are objects, that annoys me.

I assume that you noticed that the majority of nurses and teachers are female.The point is, gaming  used to be a male dominated hobby and rhrough time girls got into it. But the problem arose when people didn't like the games so first they started calling people(gamers) Geeks and Nerds, followed by "brain washed mass murderers" and now sexists and \textbf{racist}. And if you know a few gamers you will see that they can be found in different sizes and shapes, with different opinions and different lifestyles, yet they are all hanging together and having fun.Feminism chose the only people who would fire back at them, this is the only reason people are.making such a fuss about it, because we dared to stand up and say "But we are not sexist or \textbf{racist}, and you are not going to take away my games." .\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender, Racist, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}5/287 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.742 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I think it's important for people to be able to create the games they want, but in doing so accepting the criticism they will get. I never played GTAV, but if people have a problem with it, they have a right. The real issue is that women don't have any games to choose from. I like the Dead or Alive franchise and ignore the criticism about the sexy women because I still get to enjoy the game, and in a perfect world a \textbf{woman} could just choose something else to play if it wasn't for them. Unfortunately, I don't think outlawing personal space to different types of gamers is key, it's that women have no freedom of choice and are forced to hate what they get instead.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Oh look, sexist stereotyping less than one minute in (1:00)... The hypocrisy is real.I would like to see some statistics that explicitly state that women make up such a vast  of the playerbase per genre. The few surveys I have seen state vague facts like the following: "[...] the stereotype that female gamers are interested almost exclusively in casual smartphone titles is tested by the data. 47 of female gamers polled had played a disc-based game in the last six months, and 68 had played an online game. 56 of female gamers have played on a console." -  [LINK] The above quote does not disprove the stereotype. In fact it really doesn't tell us anything. Half of female gamers played a disc-based game in the last six months? That tells me \textbf{nothing} of the other 53 (which likely did not play a disc-based game at all) and six months is a huge amount of time that doesn't tell me much about the other 47... "An online game" could mean a mobile game too, so that statistic is useless. 56 " have played on a console" is also ambiguous. How recent did they play, how often and for how long?If women did represent such a large portion of the target demographic of a game like GTA V, the market would speak for itself. Game developers for certain genres would take it into consideration and insert more female characters. It would be naive to think that giant publishers that make games for the target audience of young males have not done their own research. They have polled, interviewed, and surveyed their asses off and they know exactly what their target demographics are.Disclaimer: I'm all for female gamers and female protagonists. But this sense of entitlement has got to stop. It reminds me of how there was some backlash some time ago of superheroes not being ethnically diverse. Michelle Rodriquez stated something along the lines of 'instead of complaining, how about make your own ethnically diverse cast of superheroes'. Invent your own characters to suit your liking instead of bashing characters that others have worked so hard to create.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@InvisibleJim Thanks. I looked into it a bit, and: it's a valuable study, but it shouldn't be taken as the last word on the issue (or anywhere close to the last word). The study approaches the issue in a very broad way - it assesses respondents sexist attitudes using just three very general questions. One of the study's authors mentioned this on her blog and wrote "...some believe that this study is evidence that \textbf{sexism} is not a problem within the gaming culture. This could not be further from the point." Also, the study was only conducted in Germany, so it's not clear how applicable the results are to gaming in the U.S. and elsewhere.The study should definitely be part of the discussion, but it's not the end of the discussion. This is a complex issue, and there'll never be any one, single study that can cover every aspect of it. (I'll also note that I don't think this guy's TED talk was very good - it's not '\textbf{sexism} in gaming' so much as '\textbf{sexism} in GTA 5,' and he presents very little in the way of verifiable evidence.

She then antagonises people in the industry by forcing her way into geek culture and demanding it be changed immediately while not realising the ludicrous demand she is making that an entire culture that has been around for a lot longer than she has been alive, change because someone who is not a part of that culture has decided to take bits of it out of context and cry offence.She has manifested hatred for herself (because this is the internet, any and all outspoken people get hatred directed towards them) and successfully manipulated it to work in her favour for the sake of a new career move.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Abyss SpectreFeminism is about equality whether you like it or not or are receptive to its message or not. Feminism, while obviously talking about the way in which harmful stereotypes hurt men, doesn't go out of its way to be absurd like you suggest. That women could like being oversexualized, for instance, is not necessarily a good thing; society tells them that that is where they can find much of their own worth, so seeing a sexualized women can infer that that character has a great deal of worth and should be liked, even to the point of overshadowing the need for more substantive characteristics. As for men, it is rare that men are even mad into \textbf{sexual} objects at all in videos games, and men whose only purpose in a game is to serve as a \textbf{sexual} background decoration is virtually unheard of, but these are extremely \textbf{common} for women.I hope that you'll come to see these things the way that the rest of us and the development community see it. If so, then you'll be joining the right side of history. If not, then thebeauty about this particular issue is that feminists are already winning.

It's little different than here in the US, when the \textbf{Jim C\textbf{row}} culture in the South was torn asunder by politicians from everywhere else in the country. Indeed, a lot of the objections being brought up and responses by anti-feminists are the same as those brought against civil rights leaders et al. Even so, these "outsiders" effected a positive change in that culture, much like how scholars like Anita Sarkeesian have effected positive changes in game development culture, if not in gaming culture as a whole.Feminism has come a long way, but it obviously still has a long way to go to bring \textbf{gender} equality, and not just within gaming culture, although that seems to be changing for the better already at least. Maybe the difference is not so stark where you live if you live outside of the USA, but there are tons of institutional inequities here, unfortunately. For instance, the most prominent one is demanding that men and women get paid the same for doing the same work, as there's a large difference between the US, even after one accounts for pay within the same job category. Another is that politicians in some states (cough Texas cough) are trying to make voting harder for women by imposing restrictions on those who have had their name changed.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Crow, Gender, Jim Crow & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/276 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.087 \\  \hline

What you are looking at is the cunning use of the word "earn". Men and Women are paid exactly the same for the same work in the same position for the same company. if you aggregate all men vs all women, the side with more people in full time work will always have more overall pay, but I'm guessing you've already realised that obvious statement to be true.If I am in a full time position as a bank teller and I have a female colleague, provided we are not allowed to negotiate for our contracted rate, we will receive the exact same pay as each other. If your problem is that there isn't enough women in the higher paying positions, then you will just have to wait for the the number of women graduating college (far out numbers men) to do something with their degrees.

It does, however, discriminate against people forcing their way in without getting to know anything about the culture or trying to be a part of it from the start. Just turning up and declaring "I R Nerd Now!" does not count as trying, it takes a while to get in to it and is obviously commitment that people like Anita Sarkeesian aren't interested in doing, probably because she won't be able to milk funds out of SJW's that way as there would be no controversy.The video game culture is also not oppressive and will not affect you if you have no interest in voluntarily participating, so your analogy, besides being deeply disrespectful of those affected by such hateful laws, do not make a good or convincing argument for why someone who, by their own admission, has no interest in games or gaming culture, has the right to barge in and decide that everyone who enjoys it or has found a home within it, must now give it up.What she is doing is effectively enforcing the opposite of \textbf{Jim c\textbf{row}} laws in that we are together but not equal. Everyone has to have the same thing (the together part), no one can have their own niche market, but it has to be what Anita decides (the not equal part) is OK for everyone to enjoy and if you don't like it tough, you have to deal with it because that's what feminism has decided you are allowed to have now - essentially oppression.

Without any proof, the movement looks like it has become a parody of it's former self.I have watched all of her videos, they are neither factually accurate, or educating to anyone who does 5 minutes of voluntary research after, which considering your \textbf{blind} defence and obvious desperate need to be the victim, I'd say that you haven't done the research, instead you're happy to draw parallels to actually oppressed groups from history and declare "A winrar is me!"Unfortunately it doesn't work like that, and childish things like "/micdrop" only go towards the notion that you don't have any interest or knowledge in the topic at hand and you're just trolling, which is unfortunate as it's exactly that kind of behaviour which damages the reputation of the feminist movement .Though please tell me what this "losing position that encompasses a smaller and smaller minority" is..\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Blind, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}2/247 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.81 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I am male. I oppose the idea of "feminism" (or "machismo" or any of those genderized words for that matter).I want people to behave normal. Be yourself. Don't be your \textbf{sex}. I am not "a man". I am me. And if I want to behave a certain way I do it. No matter what \textbf{sex} you connect with that behaviour. How about we don't talk about "you are a sexist" but about "I don't feel recognized the way you seem to treat people around you". Let's make it something personal. So everyone is involved.But far apart from that topic, I strive to be a huge games developer one day. I study to become one one day. Guess what I will create as soon as I can. Correct. The things I THINK are cool. If that does not fit into the expectations of 70 of humanity, 50 of this humanity being female, so be it. If no \textbf{woman} EVER likes my games, well, I won't sell THAT many copies, but well... I hope I can live from what I get. If no man ever likes my games, but women do, I will be just as fine. I don't ever think about genders when creating a game. I think about what is in my head and what I want to share with the world. If that is a sexist joke, well, it's probably because I was born and raised that way. And if YOU have a PROBLEM with MY JOKES, come RIGHT AT ME and TELL ME about it. I would love to have some responses. So if YOU can convince me that my behaviour is wrong, and I DO listen to reason, I WILL change it. As far as I am able to.I think that is the only important thing we will ever have in the whole sexism-debate. It's the same with \textbf{racism} or all the other generalizations of a group of people. We need to see everyone around as individual. Not as a "part of group xy". Not a "\textbf{woman}", a "\textbf{transgender}", a "white person" or even a "lefthanded individual".

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small When you cite Anita Sarkeesian as a credible source, you know you've gone wrong somewhere...Anita makes solid arguments, but her premises are flawed. Very flawed. She (as well as many other feminists) conflate capitalism with \textbf{sexism}. What I mean by that is, game manufacturers make male-centered games because they are catering to their predominantly male audience, not because they're sexist. She also always targets games that are specifically made for a male audience and never (rarely) games that aren't. If she would take a little effort to look past the most popular titles (Batman, Mortal Kombat), she would find a huge world of games that aren't sexist in any way (Limbo, Portal, and many many many more). And even many big titles aren't sexist, like Smash.And then there's that scandal where Anita raised a lot of money and didn't put it to use...So forgive me, but in my eyes, she is the con artist, not Thunderf00t. Thunderf00t is just a moron on youtube. Sarkeesian is trying to make it in the real world, so she needs to be more professional, reliable and factual than Thunderf00t, since her actions have direct influences on many more people than Thunderf00t's actions (Twitter, the UN, fundraisers, ...). All Thunderf00t does is rant to 680k people on youtube for ad revenue.By the way, I personally don't think that hot girls in a videogame is necessarily sexist, as long as they're not being objectified. And even if they're being objectified, sometimes this serves the storyline and is therefore excusable.It's curious how the reverse is never criticised by feminists; when a man is being tortured, when a man is killed, objectified, abused, ... And feminists also never seem to mind the impossible beauty 'standard' that's being set for men. The difference, I think, is that women get jealous or envious of a game character, while men don't, which is hilarious if that were true.Nevertheless, you're dellusional or trolling.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Sexism & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/327 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.306 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small With those statements, I can see absolutely \textbf{nothing} wrong. The pressing matter would then be to decide what is ideologically warped and what is more... in line with how reality and society actually works and looks like.However, nowhere did I read here that games without correct representation of reality have to be purged. And I doubt that will happen for as long as your children's children will live.The demand for games you can enjoy without feeling aroused to think about those matters will remain for a long time. And that's okay. I highly doubt that GTA V turned out the way it did Rockstar North wants you to think of women as failed and inferior beings. You may believe there is some attempt of satire, you may believe that it's meant to be just a game, for the sheer sake of enjoyment. Again, that is okay.One might find the SAW series unappealing, but it's a matter of fact that there is this very real thing called eustress you may experience when watching scary or suspenseful movies. This is kind of proof you can feel "good" from them, as pointless as they might be to think about as more than just entertainment. Let's be a bit unfair and say that games for the simple sake of enjoyment are (if we are being overly superstitious and forget that there is always some kind of message you may see, or some part of the aesthetics you may appreciate or not) at the very least not worse than this.It's an issue if people really think that this is how reality looks like, or is supposed to look like, and then deduct from CODBLOPS that the USA never did anything questionable during the 60s, or that life is only really rich if you were assigned the right \textbf{gender}. Not saying that anyone in here does believe so.The reason why people criticise \textbf{sexism} in games is that if a game designer didn't care about what kind of world a they build in their game, there has to be a reason this kind of content ended up in there. I might be planting an epileptic tree here, but maybe your subconscious decisions are equally, if not more telling of how you think of something than the conscious ones. Unless you think that men and women are treated according to their \textbf{gender} exactly as they deserve in your society, there might be some reason for you to ponder, very generally speaking, how this world can be made better, or at least good enough for you to be satisfied.But again, starting a discussion about \textbf{gender} equality is not my agenda.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender, Nothing, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}5/447 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.119 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Evan Lindsay Most females that raise this issue-- and I am one of them-- are gamers that simply want to enjoy their favorite hobby without having to dread that avalanche of \textbf{sex}-starved boys immediately jumping us. Just because we play games doesn't mean we want to fuck you, and not wanting to doesn't make us nut-crunching harpies. I take critique/jokes about my gaming ability as well as anyone; that's not the issue in the least. I'd love to go back into online gaming, as I met a few small groups of awesome people but they ended up fading off and then there wasn't any decent people to join up with after. But I don't go back because of that issue and the constant harassment and consistent (as well as almost always extremely explicit) stream of rape threats whenever it's discovered that I am actually a female. It also doesn't help that the industry is still relying on little else beyond the \textbf{sex} appeal of 3D women; I'd like to be able to play a female character that doesn't wear bikini strings for armor. Is that really so much to give up?Take Lilianna from Dragon \textbf{Age} for example: appropriately dressed (except, perhaps a tiiiiny bit too much cleavage in the DA:O session, but that was the case for female armor sets in general), capable, intelligent/crafty, with a well-scripted dialogue as well as backstory and still has a hint of playful sexuality (which many women have but, contrary to popular belief, don't use it just to give guys they meet blue balls 'cause they tease but won't put out).

That isn't a gendered issue. Having women dressed how you want them is fine, but you have no right to tell developers to dress them any other way than how THEY want them. You see, if we tell women to cover up in the real world we are oppressing them.

No, the idea is to make the place better for everyone to just have a good time playing and only have to sweat the jackasses/griefers/trolls temporarily. Just because society tells guys to 'deal with it' doesn't mean you fucking should.What they're saying to other men, however, is not the same. We all know that one gamer threatening to kill another is 99.999999... never going to happen-- it's so ridiculous that it's just become a major annoyance rather than a true threat.Is it really so much to ask them for the OPTION to NOT have them wear the completely useless skimpy armor? It is perhaps a handful more textures, but that's a small concession to make to open up the game to 47 more of the audience that could theoretically get to buy the game.The women that get pissed off for you just LOOKING at them are very sensitive, and that's something I wouldn't defend. Sure, fine, get nervous about it-- but to run to the defense of, "it's objectifying me!" ... no. That is one of the few things that guys insist are compliments that I typically agree are indeed simply silent compliments.What's objectifying is when you pass a guy and they then turn to their buddy and say, "look at the tits on THAT!"; when a guy that just asked you for directions and you helped him out reaches out and manhandles your breasts from his car just because he can; when female models are constantly broken down into their 'meaningful parts' (mouth, ass, tits, vagina) instead of viewed as a whole person like the 99.9999.... of male models are; when you can't get a job that you're overqualified for because either a prettier, less qualified \textbf{woman} applied as well or a male with appropriate qualifications applied; oh, and when you are immediately considered inferior in things that are traditionally male (gaming, gambling, racing, martial arts, science, mathematics, etc) or incessantly mocked for not being perfect at or at least competent at things that are traditionally female (mothering, cooking, cleaning, serving, proper manners, etc) simply based on one chromosome. I know that you'll take the last one and insist that men are treated the same-- yeah, sure. They'll rag on you about not being able to do something, but it doesn't end up DEFINING you. If you're a \textbf{woman} and you can't cook, for example, or doesn't like children, that's something people will almost certainly bring up when INTRODUCING you to someone else or simply when bringing you up in a conversation when you're not there.

Why would it be so bad if people took a page from Bioware's Dragon \textbf{Age} and Mass Effect?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@chapachuu Except, when women are subjected to the same kind of violence that men are subjected to, it's seen as harsher and politically incorrect. That's why enemies are males. Because you can kill, maim, shoot, behead or punch a man and it won't be seen as hostile or wrong or controversial. Throw one \textbf{woman} under the same category and people go \textbf{crazy}. Men are disposable in culture and this is just an appropriation of that disposabiity in play. Even Tomb Raider featured that same trope. A \textbf{woman} goes around killing only men. So don't go around assuming that it has \textbf{nothing} to do with them being men because there is a lot with them being men.People want to have their cake and eat it too. They want strong women and \textbf{colored} characters but they want these characters to be free of violence and stuff. Sorry, but that just cannot happen. When you are in the world of the game, every character follows the same rules as the world, meaning expect any of the above to take place.Male sexualisation also takes place in video games. You don't think that there are so many shirtless, ripped, bare-chested, six-packed men in video games? Irrespective of the purpose of the character design, it still fulfills the same phenomenon of sexualisation. That's the thing with media. People want to see idealistic representations of character designs. That's why there is so much focus on actors and actresses looking a certain way or being a certain way because that is an integral part of media to have that idealistic representation propagate.If you want to talk about JRPGs and their depictions of women, then you have to understand the audience they are primarily catering to. Their main audience is Japanese and East Asian and in those cultures (especially Japanese) female sexuality is celebrated instead of being shunned or tabooed the way we do it elsewhere. They celebrate the female form and the \textbf{sexual} portrayals of femininity and hence the depictions of sexuality go far beyond \textbf{sexual} satisfaction for male gamers. The fact that they are sold in the Western world is a privilege we enjoy to get a chance to play such games but for comparison's sake, you can't put JRPGs in the same category as other games and \textbf{sexual} portrayals.. On that note, why can't a \textbf{woman}'s s sexuality be empowering instead of being shameful? Do we need to continue to propagate that mentality?\textbf{Sexism} goes both ways, because when there is prejudice against one, there is prejudice against the other too. The prejudice can be positive or negative but it is a prejudice and hence \textbf{sexism}. When a \textbf{woman}'s sexuality is suppressed and a man's isn't it means that men and women are not seen as equals. When a man is killed conveniently and a \textbf{woman} is saved for political reasons, it means that we value the lives of women more than men. I'm not saying that we should not talk about \textbf{sexism} but let's not make \textbf{sexism} a gendered issue as it goes both ways, and in this talk, the speaker just does not go to address it. If he wanted to speak about rampant \textbf{sexism} in gaming, then he should have also talked about how the lives of women are more valuable than those of men which is why it's less controversial when a man gets killed as opposed to a \textbf{woman} getting killed.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Colored, Crazy, Nothing, Sexism, Sexual, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black, Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}15/573 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.618 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@qsqua We both notice the same things, but draw different conclusions. To each their own, then. I think the problem could be solved if they catered equally to women gamers and included equal numbers of male and female characters in games (note I say characters and I mean it in a literary sense). I don't know of any feminist lobbying for women characters to not get equal portrayals as men in video games. That is EXACTLY what they want. If a solid, round, unstereotypical female character were to die as part of the plot of a video game no feminist would have a problem with that. At all. It's killing female prostitutes, who are portrayed little more than background objects, for example, that people have a problem with (made worse by the fact that many men do kill prostitutes in real life). Also, you mentioned physique and sexuality as the same thing: it's not. A ripped man is not a \textbf{sexual} object; a women with no personality, with a ridiculously sized chest hanging out, and having her make sexually suggestive comments every 5 minutes, is. When male characters have their bulging penises in everyone's faces, hitting on everyone (including other men), and having that as his WHOLE character, then we can talk (and have at least two of these hyper-\textbf{sexual} \textbf{sex} objects in EVERY single game of every single genre). And don't even get me started on the media.I understand Asian, specifically Japanese, culture; you don't have to explain, or attempt to justify, their \textbf{sexism}. It IS \textbf{sexism}; tradition (and culture as part of that) does not change or excuse that fact. I have no problem with female sexuality, or any sexuality for that matter; I would just like to see sexuality as PART of a character and not as a character itself, for it to be portrayed realistically, and to see it equally in men, or not at all. Portrayal of sexuality NEEDS to come with respect, and currently it does not in any video game I've ever seen. Art is a beautiful way of portraying sexuality in all sexes and genders; for example, artists and sculptors of ancient Rome and France, respected and even revered their subjects and portrayed them beautifully. Until video game developers can do the same with their subjects and audience, it cannot be respected as an art form. And no, just because one side is prejudice it doesn't mean the other is too, though it may seem like that to defensive, privileged parties. Most feminists do not hate men or wish to see them treated the same way women are. They want everyone to be on an equal playing ground, in every regard.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Sex, Sexism, Sexual & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/450 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.667 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@chapachuu Well, there are too many feminists who have that double standard. Heard of the recent  Changethecover  hashtag? Or even how feminists like Anita Sarkeesian cherry-picks and misrepresents violence in video games to fit her "\textbf{misogyny}" narrative propaganda. There are way too many feminists like that and until you have compromises taking place, you won't see any change in the phenomenon. Equality is a double-edged sword and feminists only seem to want to hold the handle end and not the blade end and until they are ready to do just that, there isn't going to be any more pandering continuing in video games. If you want feminists to represent women's voice in the gaming sphere, then you might as well give up on dreams of benevolent representations. There's no end to their politically correct whining." If a solid, round, unstereotypical female character were to die as part of the plot of a video game no feminist would have a problem with that."There is no end to how solid, how round or how unstereotypical of a female character is enough. There just isn't in the eyes of feminists. It's more of a whinefest of entitlement than anything more for feminists gamers like these. They're just as bad as the gamers who cry about resolution or frame rate in video games. They don't deserve a higher pedestal just because they self-proclaim themselves to align with a movement that is seen as fashionable in today's \textbf{age}. See Jade Aldemir and Anita Sarkeesian's problem with that character for reference if you want to know what I'm talking about."A ripped man is not a \textbf{sexual} object; a women with no personality, with a ridiculously sized chest hanging out, and having her make sexually suggestive comments every 5 minutes, is."What?! Is that the whole "ripped men are a male power fantasy" excuse? Where in video games do you see women exposing breasts and nipples and vaginas? Why would you compare a semi-clad \textbf{woman} to a man exposing his penis? Again, why can't a \textbf{woman}'s sexuality be empowering for a \textbf{woman} AND satisfying for the male fantasy at the same time? Why do we have to choose between one or the other?"I understand Asian, specifically Japanese, culture; you don't have to explain, or attempt to justify, their \textbf{sexism}. It IS \textbf{sexism}; tradition (and culture as part of that) does not change or excuse that fact."It is benevolent \textbf{sexism}. It is a part of culture but it is also celebrated that way. A \textbf{woman} in that sort of typical femme sexualisation is actually empowering to Japanese femininity while it may not be seen as empowering to Western femininity. The East works completely different to the west in terms of what they see as degrading and what they see as celebratory, hence it's best to keep Japanese games out of this discussion as we obviously aren't able to see it in the same lens as they intend to portray it in. That's one of the reasons why feminism isn't really catching on in Japan. Sexualisation is a power and not an objectifiable quality. The women don't need liberation or upliftment in such cases because they just don't see it as a bad thing like we do. You see a problem with focusing on someone's sexuality? They see it as empowering. No need to force anyone's opinion on one another, but we're obviously talking about 2 different perspectives here so it's best left out of the discussion."And no, just because one side is prejudice it doesn't mean the other is too, though it may seem like that to defensive, privileged parties. "It seems like you're unnecessarily trying to shoehorn privilege into this sphere. I clearly stated that prejudice goes both ways by giving the example of violence against men and violence against women in video games. When you prejudice positively or negatively, the other party is also affected by the prejudice either positively or negatively. A \textbf{woman} does not have to fear as much that she will be graphically tortured or disposed the way a man might be portrayed as.Why? Feminists themselves talk about how \textbf{sexism} against women affect men too by showing how prejudice against one, means a different prejudice against the other."Art is a beautiful way of portraying sexuality in all sexes and genders; for example, artists and sculptors of ancient Rome and France, respected and even revered their subjects and portrayed them beautifully."Art is subjective. So is perception. Many parties criticise Renaissance nude art because they believe it is just an excuse to display tits and \textbf{pussy} and dick when it is generally shunned by public. I disagree but that's my opinion. That's the thing about art. Someone might notice something and someone else might notice something else. We can't assert that what we see is what everyone else should see. Although I grew up in a culture where sexuality was a taboo, I personally always celebrated sexuality and its portrayals (no matter if people thought they were cheap or beautiful). I stopped seeing sexuality as a taboo or as something cheap and I celebrate any portrayal of it-be it porn or be it Renaissance painting.But simply put, vote with your wallet. You see something you don't like? You vote that you don't like it. If there are enough people who think like you, you'll start seeing change taking place.

That's one way of getting more women into video games. Why don't people fight for that kind of representation? I'd like to see a video game exist where it's just as ok for a man to go around killing women as it is ok for a \textbf{woman} to go around killing a man (Tomb Raider).You say that men are the default, hence they are made to inhabit these roles. I say, bring women in and make them inhabit these roles so that we can have more women in games. Pray tell me why is it ok for games to have female protagonists (Samus Aran, Jade, Lara Croft) yet still have male enemies? Why the issue there? I can bet that if a video game were to be made like TOmb Raider only with a \textbf{gender} swap, then people would shout and cry \textbf{misogyny}. There is a reason why disposable roles are inhabited by men and especially white men. Because you can do any of the things I listed above to white men without questions of \textbf{racism} and \textbf{sexism} being brought up. If you want to make claims of \textbf{sexism} against women in video games then I'd like to see women share the same disposable roles that men have in video games. You can't pick and choose what and how you want women to be represented as in video games.We've seen examples of games with strong female protagonists. I'd like to see games with weak disposable, killable female enemy objects. I'd like to see games with weak disposable killable POC enemies. Once these kinds of representations are considered normal, we can say that the claims that people make about \textbf{sexism} and \textbf{racism} in video games are not one-sided and hypocritical.And it is \textbf{sexism}. Tell you why? Because men are made to inhabit these roles BECAUSE THEY ARE MEN. Had they been women, they'd not be in those roles but developers would be ok with putting women in protagonistic roles like Lara Croft or deuteragonistic roles like Alyx Vance as long as the things they are killing are not their own \textbf{gender} but disposable men. Men are discriminated because of their \textbf{gender}. To say that it is not \textbf{sexism} because men discriminate against men is like saying that a \textbf{woman} being chauvinistic against her own \textbf{sex} is not sexist. It's asinine. If you want \textbf{sexism} to not exist, you need to be \textbf{gender} \textbf{blind}. Ergo, I'd like to see a game where I can play as a male character and where the enemies who can be killed, dismembered or maimed are women.I'd like to see the next Sniper Elite game to have ovary shots.I'd like the next Uncharted to have an all-female enemy set. No male enemies fighting Nathan Drake. Why do all the henchmen have to be male?I'd like to see the next Tomb Raider have Lara Croft fighting just female enemies.I'd like to see Emily Kaldwin and Corvo Attano fight female only guards in the next Dishonored.

That right there is supporting the idea that men are the default, the standard, the basic, the preferred. The fact is, you won't find an all-female cast because they rarely exist in reality. In Dishonored, the game only had male guards because only men were enlisted for military or policing occupations in the era in which the game is meant to be set, and this is true for a lot of games based on reality.I don't cry at a male protagonist. What is bothersome is the way women are represented in MOST video games. The fact that you said this:"I'd like to see a video game exist where it's just as ok for a man to go around killing women as it is ok for a \textbf{woman} to go around killing a man"...shows me that you are either horrifyingly ignorant or are trying to formulate some kind of backlash to a threat that simply isn't there. Like...have you EVER played GTA? How many games are there where the majority of female characters are whores? How many games are out there where the women are always decked out in thongs and bikini bras even when fighting in the same combat style as men? They are looked at and used differently. What would be nice to see is equal footing when judging the value of a character.  That's all. I don't think that is an extreme request, considering that the gaming population is nearly split down the middle between the genders, and I don't know why you insist on arguing something that could be easily fixed.

"It doesn't. Know why? because it's a video game. It's not a policy that is going to take your rights away. It's not a law that is meant to liberate you in any way. It's a product that you either buy or don't buy. A video game isn't made to make up for oppression. Technically, we'd also require video games to be politically correct with things like \textbf{racism}, \textbf{sexism}, \textbf{misogyny}, \textbf{misandry}, transphobia, \textbf{homophobia} and what not. It's not going to affect you, so it's ridiculous to expect that a fictional piece of media is going to make up for \textbf{misogyny}. Let's address \textbf{misogyny} if you're that interested in doing so-let's address acid attacks, rape, domestic violence etc. But no, I guess whining about video games is better and easier and will somehow end or make up for \textbf{misogyny}." That right there is supporting the idea that men are the default, the standard, the basic, the preferred. The fact is, you won't find an all-female cast because they rarely exist in reality."Maybe if females start depicting their prowess in women-only groups you'll start seeing an all-female cast. You see, we don't have as many female leaders in the world as we have men. Similarly, we don't have as many female criminals in the world as men. Games take inspiration from the world around them. You see more women being in situations that men have been in, you'll probably see a change in media. It's also humorous how you chose to focus on women not being represented benevolently in games and not negatively as criminals, rapists, paedophiles and assassins. Why are you so against women being in these roles that men have been in for decades?"In Dishonored, the game only had male guards because only men were enlisted for military or policing occupations in the era in which the game is meant to be set,"Thief 2 introduced female guards along with male guards even though it was set in a dystopian era where men were warriors and soldiers. It took the bold step of not conforming to reality and making its own universe. But for games that do use this mold, it's as you know, once more women inhabit these roles, it gives way for people to see them as capable for being soldiers, henchmen etc. Same applies for criminal scum.".have you EVER played GTA? How many games are there where the majority of female characters are whores?"Please name a few.GTA is a game with criminal tones. The majority of female characters are not whores. Not the ones that matter.Amanda is Michael's wife who is in an unhappy marriage.Tracey is a teenager who wants to live a wild life.Tanisha is a \textbf{woman} fed up with Franklin's gangbanging.Molly is a snide secretary to a rich, hedonistic millionaire.Debra is a working \textbf{woman} with a career.Michael is a criminal who kills people.Franklin and Lamar are gangbangers.Trevor is a psychopath who killed an innocent biker because he called him a motherfucker.Jimmy is a gamer nerd who is a potty mouth online.Lastly, the entire setting is a satire and parody of a living breathing world. The male AND female characters are all laughable. You taking GTA as a benchmark for representation of men and women is redundant because it's a comedy meant to humor, not to look at with a political lens.The women you see as whores in here are just as disposable as the men who are henchmen. Saying that the women characters are whores is laughable because the men are mere target practice."How many games are out there where the women are always decked out in thongs and bikini bras even when fighting in the same combat style as men?"Names please.I assume you're talking about RPGs.Well, here's a something that you might find shocking. I have a couple of gamer friends who are women who LOVE dressing in skimpy armor and fighting in RPGs. Many women themselves love doing this because in the words of my friends "they wouldn't dare to wear something like that in real life and fight like that". You see, even if you take the male gaze out of the equation, many women will demand that they want skimpy armor to be in games because they love it. Your opinion on \textbf{sexism} is not reflective on female population as a whole and is definitely not shared with everyone who is female.In RPGs I dress up my character shirtless beacuse it's a fantasy. I also play as white people and \textbf{black} people because I can't do that in real life.If you're talking about JRPGs then forget about it. Japan has already freed the nipple in their culture. They don't demonise female sexuality like Westerners do. To them, female sexuality is empowering whether it be from a male gaze or a female gaze."That's all. I don't think that is an extreme request, considering that the gaming population is nearly split down the middle between the genders,"Split down the middle but with respect to what video games? I doubt as many women play games like Dark Souls, GTA, Metal Gear Solid etc. as men do. I'd like to see evidence on how many women are gamers and what games do they play."and I don't know why you insist on arguing something that could be easily fixed."Where have I argued against women being represented in different ways? If you look at my original comment, you'll see that my main concern was that in a discussion of \textbf{sexism}, men are not in the picture. Men are placed in criminal roles and disposable targets to beat in games. Just because men make up protagonists does not mean that placing them as criminals is not sexist since women are criminals too. Furtehrmore, I elaborated on the speaker's point about agency. I've never stated that women should NOT be allowed to have any other roles supplementary to what they have been given. I'd like to see women as criminals too.If Lara Croft can go around killing men, I'd like to see Nathan Drake going around killing women. To say that these two things are different is sexist because you're treating the same scenarios differently due to the change in \textbf{sex}."When you load up a new game, do you sigh at the fact that your \textbf{gender} isn't available to play?"No. Because I don't care about what \textbf{gender} my character is. It's why I enjoyed Portal just as much as Half-Life, why I enjoyed Beyond Good and Evil just as much as Prince of Persia. It's why I enjoyed Thief and Thief 2 as much as Thief2x. I don't care about what \textbf{gender} I'm playing. Never cared. Video games could have had all female protagonists for all I care, I still wouldn't care at all. It's the character, gameplay, setting and experience that matter. Not whether the imaginary person on the screen has breasts or not."do you roll your eyes at the fact that she can only wear skimpy and outrageous clothing compared to everyone else?"Outrageous for you, not for everyone else. It's your problem not everyone's problem in your \textbf{gender}. I won't be surprised if the ones complaining about skimpy armor are the vocal minority of women and skimpy armor is only present in some games, not all games. Maybe you should play more games that very well give you the CHOICE to dress up your character the way you want. Play the way you want and others can play the way they want. What games have you been playing? I'd like to know."Despite the fact that such inferiority doesn't or shouldn't exist anymore, do you find yourself pissed off at the fact that people seem to hate the idea of standing up for yourself because of your \textbf{gender}?"Stand up for yourself, not your \textbf{gender}. Don't dictate what people should find offensive or not. You're tired of seeing some things in video games-how is that any different than a console gamer tired of seeing 1080p on his console on all video games? \textbf{Gender} debates and politics like these are fruitless and no more credible than resolution and frame rate debates and PC vs console debates. They're all trying to fight for something that is a non-issue. I'm not ok with men being the only \textbf{gender} to be henchmen, criminals and gangbangers. I don't whine about it. I only brouht this topic up because this video existed.It's like a man crying that movies and products like Barbie always show men as prizes that women seek and that women are attracted to them because of their princely charms and \textbf{gender}, not because of their personality. It's asinine to relate this to something as grave as \textbf{gender} equality."Even if I were to agree with you at male \textbf{sexism} in video games, it's just not relevant enough"And I guess that the existence of a greater problem negates the existence of a comparatively lesser problem? It does not. Both are non-issues. This video is about \textbf{sexism} in gaming. And not a single second of this video is spent mentioning \textbf{sexism} against men in gaming that is rampant because while there have been women protagonists and fleshed out women characters, there still haven't been henchwomen, women for target practice and disposable women. It's a biased one-sided view of a TED talk."There's \textbf{zero} reason for you to be getting all up in arms over what you perceive to be \textbf{sexism} because it doesn't permeate into reality."Disagreed.Men are more likely to get profiled as \textbf{sexual} predators.Men are more likely to be profiled as criminalsMen are more likely to face harsher sentencing for crimes.Men are more likely to be left behind while women and children go first. (disposable male).Men are more likely to face harsher street violence because there is little aid for a man facing violence.And this is assuming that what happens in video games actually permeates into reality. We have no evidence of that, so we cannot make claims about permeating into reality."Over the entire existence of our species on this planet, men have had the upper hand."Well that's relative.Do you consider dying in wars and suffering PTSD a privilege?Do you consider forceful military service and bearing arms in times of crisis a privilege?Do you consider false accusations made by women a privilege?Do you consider female-on-male rape being classified as "lucky guy" and "women cannot rape men" as privileges?Because privilege is relative. Men and women have had it hard at different instances in different times.And btw, how does historical oppression relate to current times? You haven't faced any of the horrors women faced years ago, so why are you banking on oppression to justify your voice and opinion on \textbf{sexism} as something deeming more important?"When one looks at a man, one sees his capabilities, flaws, talents, skills, and demeanour.

There are people who criticize violent as a way of problem solving in games and look at it under that point (and use it like for example when looking at army and forced service they say that its generally wrong to force people to do army-duty and it doesnt become better if you force women too (which isnt my opinion btw.. I am against forced service but when you force one, you should force all and give ppl the right to opt out based on ethical concerns(so they can do social services for example)so, like anita seems to be very pacifist in the way that she criticizes videogames that are very vioent.

Because a lot of female villains in games and in media in general are such hyper-sexual people...(which then leads to the question why the fuck do we see sexuality as this dark and bad and perverse thing and use it to accentuate the depravity-female villains control and manipulate with \textbf{sex} (a stuff a lot of female streamers and..well in general well known women get thrown at them) and the male villains rape..as if there wasnt other possibilities to show a bad character.. = =(I remember, like unreal tournament 03 had the possibility to play as female character. Fighting games had always female characters in them-who usually have physically impossible clothing and must suffer from kind of steel back looking at the size of their tits..(but well, looking at what those charas survive..maybe they have the wolverine gene)I know that you could kill children in Fallout 2-and that this was censored out here in germany.

Its the sexist notion that women are too delicate and nice to fight. (which is wrong. Women have fought all the time. They were pirates, shield maidens. Not in the number of men, thats known, but they have existed...)So, just put the in. Rockstar should give  female player character (because there were a lot of female monsters out there..

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small justin hope I am a feminist, funny thing. How it's viewed will likely depend on the presentation. If the female mooks are just that, mooks who happen to be female alongside male mooks, that'd be swell. Female representation is a win; ladies can be bad guys too, ; )There are factors that one would have to take into consideration when making the female mooks, yes, in order to keep them from being seen in a sexist light. Whether they are dressed in clothes significantly skimpier than their male counterparts (if they have male counterparts), if the female enemies are made mechanically weaker than men (though this could fly if they exceeded the male mooks in dexterity or another attribute, which might make for more diverse and interesting gameplay), things like that, you know? There's \textbf{nothing} wrong with having visually appealing characters or a Boobs Mcgee or two, but it's nice when ladyfolk can be respected just like (or in the case of some cases, hilariously disregarded for the sake of slapstick and japes) the guys.My apologies for elaborating on my thoughts so much, but...Games are an art. Like any other, they have complexity and value, and everything from their art style to their mechanics can speak volumes if you want it to. It's all rather fascinating and exciting to pour through. Playing through a game is wonderful, and for me it become even more wonderful to mentally pick it apart, because it's then and there where all the effort that went into making the game and all it's meaning can be laid out for all to see.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small justin hope Anita was definitely off on that, because the hookers were intended to be snuck around instead of killed. There was actually mechanical incentive NOT to kill them. They were not mooks as I am speaking about. A mook in a game is an enemy; a character who you can kill who will fight back. An NPC you can kill with no real resistance from them, such as those hookers, is not a mook. So, I must apologize for refuting you, but bringing up those hookers isn't relevant to my initial point.Though we can discuss those if you'd like! NPCs and \textbf{sexism} has its own mess of fascinating complications.If you are including a male version of a female NPC for the express purpose of "not being accused of \textbf{sexism}", you should probably take a hard look at why those characters might be considered sexist in the first place and consider reworking that instead. Is it because the characters are hollow female shells with no character complexity whatsoever? Do they exist only as eye candy for the viewer? There are places where eye candy is acceptable, and not every character has to be given depth and a backstory, but it gets tiresome to repeatedly see female characters who are only hollow shells in bikinis to be rescued, ignored, or killed on the player's whim.Now, I'm not one to point out a problem without also trying to mull over possible solutions. Adding in the male hookers was indeed a solution, but a very shallow one that didn't address the core of the problem -- that the female hookers are little more than vapid eyecandy. In this case, NPCs like the female hookers in Hitmen might be better received if they were at least balanced out by having one or two side-character hookers who were more three-dimensional characters. You know, people you could talk to and get quests from pertaining more to their personal lives and to the reality of being a \textbf{woman} (or man -- this could be done with male hookers too!) in the \textbf{sex} industry.I am also well aware that there will always be criticism lobbed at games that dare touch on issues such as \textbf{sex} work, but we could definitely reduce the criticism if we addressed the issue with tact and understanding!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Sex, Sexism, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}5/388 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.289 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@lollmemm Of all the groups of gamers... to say that the console players are the ones that stick up for "yes means yes"? Wow... have you ever listened to how those shits react if a girl gets on the mic on ANY FPS? I certainly wouldn't point there for the standard of standing up for women's right to consent. And if you think PC people are any better, let me shed a bit of light...I'm not a feminist. I am, however, part of that 47 of females that participate in the gaming community. I used to play MMOs quite frequently for about 3 years. I never said a word about me being female, and denied it if I was asked, due to the issues that I faced when the fact was found out. Constant \textbf{sexual} harassment, ranging from the seemingly benine, "so... you know... I'm single... *wink, wink*" to extremely graphic and specific descriptions of how they wanted to rape me. Some people dismiss this, as they technically cannot do it because they have no idea where I am... but if you're heavily into gaming, there's also a good chance you can figure out how to back trace an IP. That fear alone was a major factor in my eventually being unable to even consider logging in due to the dread of what I would face for simply enjoying my favorite hobby.The point of that is that THAT is what we face. Is it too much to ask that we have the ability to play a female character, or enjoy side female characters, that don't look like Photoshopped Ralph Loren models, aren't dressed in string bikinis for armor and actually have some kind of personality? We all have sexuality, and there's no reason to get rid of that, but if you're going to do that to women at least have some men that are treated in the exact same way. We'd like some eye candy too, you know. Plus, \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} men would be happy to have that addition, I'm sure. But I doubt it will happen, as it apparently makes straight men EXTREMELY nervous and insecure. Welcome to how women feel every time we watch a movie, see ads, or play the vast majority of video games. As you all like to say about our justified complaints: DEAL WITH IT.I'm VERY pleased with BioWare, for example-- they write brilliant games, such as the Dragon \textbf{Age} and Mass Effect titles. THOSE are the games I recommend to people. Though I like the indie scene that I've stumbled onto in the last few years, there aren't many of them that don't rely on the completely overinflated sexuality of 3D females. I have only one criteria that can almost without fail tell me what \textbf{gender} is missing from the development team: "Look at the female models in the game. Are they realistic? Then there's likely at least one \textbf{woman} will pull on that team, or at least a man (or several men) that don't see women as \textbf{nothing} more than \textbf{sex} objects. If they are not realistic: it's boys calling the shots."\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Gay, Gender, Nothing, Sex, Sexual, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Youngsters, Gender - General, Sexual Identity - General, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality & \cellcolor{green!5}8/522 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.533 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small THERE IS TOO MUCH \textbf{SEXISM} IN GAMING CULTURE, AND IT IS IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT IT LIKE THIS MAN IS DOING, but GTA is a game where you can kill anyone, not just women.  You can have \textbf{sex} with a \textbf{hooker} and kill her because that exists in real life crime.  It's a game about crime, it's a game about breaking the law and some people will take that more seriously than others because that's what the game let's you do, and that's what makes the game so engaging.  GTA does not incite violence against women, it is a game where you can do whatever the hell you want.  Also, these video games are made for adults and are given an M rating for a reason.  In the end, the problem is with the parents for buying M rated games for their kids, and not supervising their gaming when the games are less than ideal for kids.  Video games have been a big part in decreasing youth violence in the last 10 years.  What to know why?  Because when a 14 year \textbf{old} wants to get their angsty teenage anger out, and feels like shooting someone, he can go play GTA with parent supervision (to the point where his/her parents don't need to supervise anymore because they've raised their kids to know the difference between video games and real life), instead of ACTUALLY shooting someone.Please, get your facts right.  There is a lot of \textbf{sexism} in video game culture, but a lot of the shame is being put on the game developers, when it's really just a small portion of the gaming community.  Go look up Gaming for Good.  It's a fantastic site that has raised millions of dollars for great causes.  THAT is a more accurate description of gaming culture.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Hooker, Old, Sex, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s, Gender - Female sexuality, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}5/302 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.656 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@pluubooruu The likelihood is slim, but possible. You don't live in the same mindset as women do. The reason why that 'tactic' is so damn effective is because women are taught to believe that there's a rapist around every fucking corner. Sure you can say they're just following you around and you can block them-- which is bullshit because most MMO's feature a dastardly little thing called 'world chat' or 'shout' that you can't usually block. Even if you do, everyone else gets to see what this duchebag is saying and following you around attempting to make as many even slightly \textbf{sexual} moves as possible with his limited-animation character and it's fucking infuriating.Also, I'm not asking for protection-- we have the ability to report the abuse, and I've done that... not that it often resulted in anything, despite your assertion that they were banned; the best I got was a temporary ban but he simply switched to a different account and continued-- my point is that guys that don't do that shit shouldn't just laugh at it. They should kick the asshat out of their group/also report him. Surely other gamers report or force out duchebags that camp incessantly in online FPS games?Frankly, yes. I'd rather be killed than be raped. The constant night terrors, inability to walk down a street without being on the verge of breaking down due to fear that he'll come back and do it again... no. I'd rather they say they'll kill me. I could-- and have-- just brushed that shit off. As for being worthless trash and being called out for my sexuality; being accused of being a blue-ball inducing \textbf{lesbian} \textbf{dike} is apart of my real life as well as online when I simply tell some guys that I don't want to fuck them. I'm bisexual, but that's not even the goddamn point. The rejection just too much of a blow to their more fragile than glass egos for them to take, so they feel like they have to degrade me as much as possible to feel better. Typical asshat bullies.And PLEASE tell me how women are toxic? Did she insult the size of your dick? Did she say that you couldn't last in bed? Hardly close to what is said to women in terms of harassment. The worst I've ever seen is of those girls that get on games and proclaim their \textbf{gender} just to grab the attention that the rest of us attempt to be invisible to avoid."you'd rather just give up on a hobby cause you got harassed once."ONCE?! Did you not read my fucking comment?This shit was done almost every single session I played, for at least two of the three years I played-- and before that I did my best to be as invisible as possible as I learned the mechanics so I wouldn't be a complete noob when I started looking to join a proper party and really climb the level ladder.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small That ESA included games like candy crush which let's be honest is not a gamer's game. Women usually played those types of games. I play a wide range of games from COD, Battlefield, Halo to Fifa and football manager, yet i still don't consider myself a Gamer because I know that's not enough to be a real gamer. With that being said, there are still real female gamers out there. However, there's no doubt that the majority of gamers are men. So when you say "punch them in the face" to those that say women don't play real games...then you need a learn the difference between Halo and candy crush. Journalism in gaming is a very sensitive topic and it's probably why there were comments like that there. There's alot of corruption in gaming journalism which has been around for a number of years now. Also any public figure knows that they can be subjected to death threats. Difference is, they all know that death threats are not to be taken seriously. I use Marilyn Manson as an example, he received lots of death threats in the late 90's yet he still did his shows.1) "No female leads" - There are female developers out there. They can easily make a video game like GTA and make a female lead. Society should not dictate the way the game is developed. It would be like writing the material for a comedian to do his set. Also you can hack the game and add mods that you want. So you can make a female character yourself if it really bothers you that much. If the game is not catered to you, then don't play it.2) "posters" - A cartoon \textbf{woman} in a bikini. So what? Does women in a bikini mean that she's a prostitute? It looks like there is a beach in the background so it seems like it's pretty normal attire for a day out on the beach. Sure it an attractive \textbf{woman} but so what if that helps sell? Besides children are not buying the game seeing as the game is rated 18. If a child does acquire the game, then that's bad parenting. 3) "Women in the game" - So it's better to be a guy that is a mobster, evil, thief etc. Where are the good guys in the game? The point is, there are no good people in the game. There's only relevant and irrelevant people and it tries to reflect society as much as it can when it comes to perpetrators. Also if there were missions that involved killing women, there would probably be an outcry over men promoting violence against women. You just can't win this. 4) "Shaming women" -  Sure women are shamed in this game. We have to understand that it's a game. No-one takes this as reality, otherwise you'd see these things happening alot in society. Games don't want to be an artform in the ways you're suggesting. The artform of games is to be anything it wants to be. That is it's artform. It doesn't want to be controlled in any way. Rap is also considered an artform even though it includes killing men and calling women bitches. It knows know boundaries just like games and is the reason why it's loved. By choosing what happens in games, you're taking away the very soul of a game. It's no long a developers game. If Rockstar gave in to these demands, then people would just stop playing and wait till another game similar to GTA came out. They'll end up playing that one instead.GTA will offend some people sure. That's what's so good about it. It allows you to enter a fantasy world which seems very similar to ours. If you don't like the game, then play another game. I love how for years Men who loved video games and comics were looked at as nerds, undesirable by women and living in basements. The psychological impact it had on these people didn't matter at all at that time. However now, the very games that they enjoy are being taken over by people who people who never cared for them in the first place, and quite frankly, don't care about the game. Just because there's money in gaming, there's more people around. If racing cars in the streets was legal and a multi billion dollar industry, you'd have women arguing about how the \textbf{woman} at the start is half naked when she calls the \textbf{race}.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Race, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}4/755 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.53 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I just want to say that I'm a girl who plays WoW to a point that it could be considered unhealthy, and to all the girls out there who play LoL or WoW or any of the really big MMO's, that the way we are treated isn't because every boy/man that plays them is "misogynistic" but because most of these games predominantly consist of males. I understand there are some sexist comments that are thrown at you but you have to understand not every male gamer is out to get you or objectify you. You can't have tissue paper skin when you play these games. A lot of men/boys probably react to you the way they do (with comments like, "OMG A GIRL?!, MARRY ME?) because they are genuinely surprised that a girl is playing that game, or maybe just flirtatiously poking fun at you. If the tables were turned and the games we played consisted mostly of females, I'm almost positive the treatment we receive, we would have given to the men. I understand how it feels to be ridiculed for being a girl and playing a game. People would expect me to be horrible at the game because I was a girl and if they thought I was good it mean't I was \textbf{fat} and ugly. If someone is being hateful or toxic to you, you just have to ignore them because they aren't worth your time. If they think you're bad for being a girl then prove them wrong. And if you are bad at the game then it's fine because there are plenty of bad male players too. And it's not just girls who have to put up with shit. Some guys and gals are mean to each other and you just have to learn not to be so sensitive about it because in the end WE ALL have to put up with each other's shit.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Fat & \cellcolor{green!5}Physical Identity - Physical Features & \cellcolor{green!5}1/320 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.312 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Do games have \textbf{sexism}? Yes they do and it is good that we do have conversations about it. So how is the \textbf{sexism} portrayed in gaming? Well in many ways and very differently in between different sexes.For example, most protagonists are males and usually white males. While I have no issues with it if the artist wants to make them white and male, I would still love more diversity in gaming protagonists.In the future as technology develops and the industry grows even more, I suspect that we will be having \textbf{gender} variation options in every single possible game and that they will be done so that it addresses your chosen \textbf{gender} variation. And skin colors too, pretty much all the good character customization options there are.Now at the moment, there certainly are stereotypes in gaming for both sexes. Women tend to be portrayed often as sidekicks or romantic pursuits. Like I already said once before, this is fine as long as the artist themselves want it to be like that. But it doesn't have to be and diversity is more than welcome.Men tend to fill the role of protagonist, the hero, the one that carries the whole platform or the villians of gaming that are \textbf{nothing} more than pure punching bags to the game characters. Redundant mass almost. This is also important to address when you look at the \textbf{sexism} in gaming.What about gamer behavior and the issue of males getting harassed more but women getting more personalized harassments? This is true and unfortunate since the girls I play with are actually very good gamers and fun to play games with.The issue with this is that psychologically males use 7 times more grey in their brains matter than girls do. Grey matter are localized areas in our brains that process information and focus. This means that boys have more tendency to have a tunnel vision and focus on one specific thing at a time. While they are focused, like playing in video games, they can become very insensitive of the world around them.Add to the fact testosterone, a hormone that is mainly used in male bodies that supports aggressive and competitive behavior in males further adds males primal need to be competitive and dominating even. This explains the way males sometimes act the way they do online.It has more to do with biological bodily functions than their personality per say, although it is true that practicing self awareness of own behavior and maturity often can help the person from at least voicing their thoughts if anything else.How about girls then? Well it is also proven that girls have on average 10 times more white matter in their brains. White matter is the parts of brains that move around information and operate sensory systems as well as processing accomplishments faster. This means in practice is that female brains are more adapt to think somewhat more complicated but in more conclusive manner as well.Female brains are also more adapt to have sense of surroundings and because of this, girls do sense things that male brains don't. So female brains do have a greater concept of words, tones, behavior and whatnot while male brains are much more direct and simpler in this scenario. Because of this, female brains are more sensitive in that they are more aware of what is actually really harmful and rude while male brains just pass it all as the same fodder.Female brains also process accomplishments faster than male brains do. This means for example, that female brains are faster at reacting to anything than male brains are which can be a huge benefit in games that require fast reflexes.I am a psychologist so I know a bit about neuroscience between genders.A good scenario of that senselessness in male brains is an example that I faced some months ago. I was playing in a game all by myself with 3 randoms. One of the randoms turned out to be a girl, and while I did not jump the gun and treated her normally as a fellow gamer in my eyes, I still managed to act like a douchebag, although unintentionally.So here is how it went:Girl: Do not piss off a girl with flamethrower! :DMe: Do not piss off a girl in general.Girl: That is incredibly offensive.And she left the game. Now at this point I felt really bad because in my eyes it was meant to be a compliment and not an insult. What I thought was that girls are strong enough like males are that you really shouldn't piss off a girl because she can kick your ass.But my mistake, because she found it offensive rather than a compliment of girl strength.However the further I thought about it, I was further confused as to what I said wrong. I have always had the policy that pissing off anyone in general is not a very good idea, no matter if the person is a girl or a boy.Surely she would agreed if I would have followed my comment with the notion that pissing off guys isn't a good idea either, because pissing of people in general is not a good idea.I mean who goes around streets, pissing off people just for personal laughs. And I wonder how many times that asshole person would have gotten their ass kicked to the orbit. Because I suspect that if you would act like a huge douchebag to people you do not know, you would find yourself in hospital very often.Then again, I also know that I might be insensitive since my male brains aren't programmed to notice things as well as female brains are. So it might be entirely my own douchebag attitude that I am just not aware off or that the girl I was talking to was just hyper sensitive and in the mood of looking for fights. In any case, there are differences how females and males behave and understanding that also helps you to deal with the situations a bit better.TL;DRNow, like I said in the beginning of this post. Gaming is sexist towards both sexes in very different ways and being aware of it helps because it makes the developers consider alternative options more than they do know. And while I have no issues how things are now because artistic freedom is more important than \textbf{gender} politics in a artificial and virtual world, I still welcome diversity if the artist so chooses to do.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender, Nothing, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}7/1102 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.635 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Mikasa PinataI get that. Thaks for making that lucid enough though. The point is, when considering representations of women (let's say specifically in GTA 5), the game draws from believable scenarios. Meaning that you have women pedestrians but also women as strippers or prostitutes. Similarly you have male pedestrians but also male security guards, henchmen, soldiers and criminals. Because that is a game that draws upon believability. Sure, there are a small number of male strip clubs, prostitutes, etc. and there are a good number of female cops, security detail, soldiers etc. but the number is lesser.(In fact, I actually remember seeing female cops gun me down twice in the game which was quite a surprise. No male strip clubs though-would be a good addition to future games for all those straight women and \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} men :P)But the point I want to segue into is that when women are represented in a positive light it's all fine and dandy but the moment women are inflicted violence upon, killed or otherwise you have people protest (Remember how GTA 5 was banned in Australia and why). I think that that is unfair. If we are to pursue strong, fleshed out female characters (which we should) then we shouldn't treat them as fragile entities when put in a gritty world like that of GTA 5 or other video games.

Gamers don't care about \textbf{gender} and there are other games for women. Around 14:00 minutes you pretty much describe your bias. How a \textbf{woman} character in game is only as good as how powerful she is to the plot or in more direct terms. Next time when I go see Hunger Games III Movie I'll be sure bitch and moan a lot about  how sexist that movie is against men. How it portrays the man as a damsel in distress needing saving from Jennifer Lawrence and her bow. Just play the games don't insult a community while making money doing it. I don't care if you are man \textbf{woman} child or a \textbf{frog}. Gamers only care about one thing when it comes to other players, and that's if you are "good at the game".\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Frog, Gender, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General, Nationality - French & \cellcolor{green!5}4/149 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.685 \\  \hline

And I wouldn't brand anyone as 'misogynist' or 'sexist' who simply or even 'passionately' argued this, but don't you think a lot of the 'hateful' comments she received were beyond rational critique of her work? I really don't know how anyone is going to justify the abuse directed towards her about 'killing her family' or raping/murdering her and then "drinking blood from her c***". In the context of the hate campaign against her, I can very much understand why people are supporting her. And hey, if any guy got the sheer volume of abusive comments she's gotten, I would definitely sympathise equally with him. It's beyond \textbf{gender}, people might cry 'sexism' or whatever, but it's more than that - there's been a lack of humanity.I also did say that people clearly 'do care'. I said that in my comment - I was responding to the original commenter who was trying to say people "don't care". I think you and I agree there at least?And one last point - does social critique always need a tonne of research? I mean (as a non-gamer, don't hold it against me, I was just curious!!) from watching her videos, the snippets from the games themselves are pretty convincing sources. And some of the games she uses like GTA5 are hardly obscure. Anyway, she's only a "scam" as much as casinos are. People will always choose to throw their money away on what matters to them. I guess if people are interested, why shouldn't they financially support her project?

In MMOs they get gifted stuff, get immediate help and often get invited to higher level clans and parties SOLELY based on their \textbf{gender}. That IS a BENEFIT.Most other competitive modes however, don't give anyone special treatment and are ruthless to all. If they strike a nerve with a comment, you can expect them to follow through on such insults, they WANT to lower your game by attacking your weak points. THIS IS NOT AN EXCEPTION TO MALES EITHER. (If insulting your womenhood or being a mysogynist prick gets under your skin, expect it to continue... or idk IGNORE them?)So I'm basically seeing this from all you whiners, all the SJWs and all the feminists attacking gaming: WOMEN SHOULD NOT BE TREATED BADLY IN GAMING.And if we mention how men are belittle and made fun of in said games, no one gives a shit. Women are still being "mistreated"... who cares if men are though, right? The disposable vermin male \textbf{gender}. So much for equality...

If they were smart, they'd report, ignore and move right along, but this clearly doesn't happen if everyone on that side of the fence (most of which aren't real gamers) is raising such a big fuss.And yeah, go ahead throw ad hominems.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Meow Laksap I'm not saying it is a boy's club. It's never been a boy's club, actually. Girls have always been around in gaming. Not as much as now or as much as men... but guess what? Everything has been fine by them... until Sarkeesian and the feminists/SJWs decided to jump in and start policing shit with their PC BS.Underepresented or misrepresented? Are you fucking kidding me? I'm a \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} male, and I don't bitch about lack of \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} characters (both male and female, which there are WAY LESS of, and are usually displayed as stereotypes). AND EVEN LESS TRANS CHARACTERS!!!And if you're stating you're under/misrepresented when there's so many female characters out there, (some bad and good, both in design and/or in practice) I'll either call you a liar or a whiner.Become a dev and change that if you think it's a big problem... you definitely can, no one is stopping you. But will the game sell? Will it be enjoyed? Cause in the end, that's what gamers want, regardless of \textbf{gender}. And if you don't get the money to fund the next game from your first, you're probably out of a job or at the very least, not gaining any profit.And opinions matter if they have merit. Sarkeesian (sorry if I mention her name a lot, but SHE is the one who started this utter shite storm of nonsense) has been pointed out to not really be a gamer (she has been recorded saying that video games are, and I QUOTE "gross") and has not given credit to the Let's Play-ers that she stole footage from, AS well as completely lying in some of said videos. I should really care about that type of person's opinions? And the opinions of those who follow her blindly?And I don't think gaming is simply for men. Let me be clear on my opinion of this: games are primarily geared towards MOSTLY men, but are usually universally enjoyable. Statistics are clear, men are more interested in hardcore games at a significantly higher rate then women, and casual games tend to be towards unisex (or children depending on the game). And the less casual games are becoming ever more female-friendly (and not in a bad way... yet).I'm sorry if I seem frustrated, but so many seem fixated on making games totally politically correct, and so female empowering, and I have no problem with the latter so long as it doesn't shame men or make them look like crap, but it usually does when it comes to feminism. Look at college sports, it has to be 50/50 \textbf{gender} ratio, even if significantly less girls are interested. I don't want it to have quotas like this in game design and such, because I know there's people out there like Anita, who will simply get in to stamp out anything she doesn't like or find appropriate.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gay, Gender & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General, Sexual Identity - General, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality & \cellcolor{green!5}6/486 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.235 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small So what if they aren't good at gaming, what matters is that they want to game. If they have payed as much for their games as the rest of us, then they should be able to voice their opinion without getting hate from other gamers, these complains is to be heard by the developers, and it's up to the devs if they want to listen or not. I'm a real gamer by your definition then, I started when I was 5, played on my famicom, and as I got older I play resident evil, tekken and FF series. I'm 19 now and I play games everyday. I also play competitive games like league of legends, dota2, and smite, I get best stats 90 of the time when play. I do get mad at those who aren't good, but I do not flame or tell them to uninstall, they deserve to play as much as I do. All you can hope for is better matchmaking. Lately I've been into Destiny (which I think did an awesome job when It comes to \textbf{gender} equality, since female guardians, actually look like they know how to fight, and are not dress as playboys bunnies and wear highheels to the battlefield, that's what I call silly.You must understand that women who actuallly game feels like they don't belong, it makes them uncomfortable playing the games and a female character in the game are oversexualized for male pleasure only. What does that say to us and young gamers.We will not tolerate being portrayed as \textbf{sex} objects. Ofc there are those who doesn't mind this and there are those who does. These people matters.

I'm not that interested in Anita, since I have formed my own opinion out of my own experience. I honestly believe that the reason games are played more by men is the result of games being developed for male audience. It's very adrocentric, and could very likely be the reason why women have less interest in "hardcore games" games. But hardcore games isn't more of a "real game" and other games according to me. It's just more hardcore, just another genre really. That's why unisex games like the sims and many games on phones that doesn't have specific \textbf{gender} targeted have way more female players. like you said, if I understood you correctly.It's really isn't the game developers fault or mens fault. Society has created this both men and women, movies are the same. It's manmade, therefore it can be changed.I'm sure that more women will start playing more games if it become more female friendly. We shouldn't prevent something that could actually be good for everybody, it's not just female that wants things to change, men that fight on our side clearly isn't offended or find it to be shaming men. You should feel untouched.Just let Anita do whatever it is she is doing, ignore it and you will feel much better. If things really are changing then let it.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Meow Laksap Maybe not, but games will be dramatically changed... too much so that most people will lose interest and the gaming industry could potentially die... And it's not just that but the whole premise of women feeling unequal. Really? Maybe we should make 50 of AI enemies female. As it stands, in video games, nearly all enemies to be slaughtered with little to no care of their character are male. Only the \textbf{Elder} Scrolls and games like that series seem to defy that stereotype. What this presents is that men are disposable and unimportant. They are just generic people who are like bugs to be squashed or vermin to be eradicated.See what I did there? You could spin video games into whatever issue of \textbf{sexism} you want. But until you have good, clear and concise evidence that women have it rough in the game industry, that they are under-represented and misrepresented, and treated so much worse then men, then I'm afraid you're being completely and utterly dishonest, and are making a big deal out of \textbf{nothing}, of which you accused ME of.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Elder, Nothing, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s, Age - Youngsters, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/184 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.63 \\  \hline

That's how things improve. No, you can actually find someone sexy without seeing her as a \textbf{sex} object. The reason why they become \textbf{sex} object is how they choose to portray them. I can find a modestly dress and a quite girl/boy sexy, but in gaming they make it easy for us to objectify, since they are just there to fulfill your \textbf{sexual} desire or whatever, although they don't really have any roll in the story or are playable at all.I didn't say everyone has to be ugly and unattractive, but how often do we see a female that is as stinky and unattractive as Twitch?

These are basic rules of conduct so I have a normal gaming experience. The one thing this guy points out that makes 0 sense with your argument is why does it matter to you? Why does an idea of more female playable characters or protagonists bother you?

I swear the excuses people come up with to maintain the status quo are such bullshit. No matter how many statistics and facts we show some people about \textbf{sexism}, they still think their imaginary and narrow-minded perception - that the advocacy for women will lead to \textbf{sexism} towards men - is already an existing fact. Basically, because of the possibility that men MIGHT be treated unfairly, we shouldn't bother trying to treat women equally at all. These people think their biased opinion is more legitimate and real and worth caring about than the abhorrent statistics feminists reference. These people cry out hypocrisy when they find one double standard in favor of women. They think that that one double standard in favor of us makes up for the 20 double standards in favor of them. It's either women play it completely fair without straying a hair, or the men refuse to cooperate. Everything has got to be 50/50 or male dominated. God forbid a video game cast ever consist of two women and one man!! Oh my God. It's the Apocalypse. Humanity has been misrepresented. Women are not universally relatable. They're all the same! There can only be a token \textbf{woman} because "\textbf{Woman}" is a character type category equal to "Grouchy" "Brainy" and "Clumsy". Yes, I'm looking at you smurfs with your "Smurfette". Is there any reason that half the smurfs couldn't be female? Do grouchy, brainy, clumsy, etc. women not exist? Is being a vain man different from being a vain \textbf{woman}? Now look, I'm not dissing the smurfs, but using it as an analogy. It's not as obvious as in the smurfs, but in many media, "\textbf{Woman}" is a token character. It's insulting. We're more than 50 of the population, but get to be represented by only one character? How does that make sense? Now I know I got off topic, but if anyone would like to see equal representation in male and female characters, watch the Avatar TV series. You know, if trying to be equal in positive ways is too hard for everyone to swallow, then maybe we should just aim to try to be equal in negative ways.

I wanna marry you!"If it's a girl who's good at the game, she'll be called out as having an ebay acc or having been boosted, and if she's bad, that's normal and to some desirable because teaching a girl the game and helping her is apperantly something to want. To me it's not shocking at all that several boys that I know have felt a little \textbf{weird} when I teach them stuff about a game or end up having better stats than them, or even when I call another lane or roll than they expect me to want. I fucking HATE premades that just assume the girl is going to go support, Please, bruiser top.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I assume you're going by statistics that say women make up around 45 of the gaming market. This is true, but these sources include any form of gaming, even mobile gaming and maybe even facebook gaming. So, given all this it's not really a surprising statistic. However, when it comes to more "hardcore" gaming, on console but particularly competitively on PC, it is still ruled by a pretty solid majority of males. Apparently women only make up 16 of WoW players, for one. Honestly, if women truly were as \textbf{common} in these types of games as you believe, the problem wouldn't exist, as you'd be playing with almost 50 women and no one would think female presence was something to make note of.I'm not agreeing with unequal treatment of women in gaming, and I agree that no matter the demographical differences, everyone should be treated with respect, but the misconception surrounding the figures is basis of things that are close to this topic that I don't agree with.

However, even if every gamer on this planet were male, the kind of \textbf{sexism} portrayed in many games would still not be ok.Maybe more girls aren't getting into gaming as much as boys do because they don't see examples they can relate to when they look at current games?\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Sexism & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/87 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.149 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I find it funny how different people define "gamer" and "hardcore". I remember going to a game store to purchase wow airtime and when the clerk asked if I gamed and I replied yes he then asked "what, only WoW right?".So some people don't even see that as a real game.Funny thing is a few years before that I worked in a gaming store as I have been passionate about games since before I can remember (4, 5 years \textbf{old} ? some where in the mid 80s). I grew up with PC games from \textbf{old} dos games (tertis,  heros quest, Trivial Pursuit) through 90's pc games (warcraft2+3, starcraft, final fantasies, Counterstrike, quake), PS2 (i have +-200 games in my collection), PS3 and Newer PC games (wow, SC2, D3, Witcher), xbox 360, PC Lans, Console lans and now to PS4 (I am currently playing Watchdogs and Destiny).  He didn't know this ofc. He just looked snarkly at his friend as though to say "see, girls don't play "real" games. They don't' play OUR games".I moderator a popular local gaming forum as well. I don't advertise I am a girl and only the \textbf{old} regular posters really know for sure that I am. It's funny how people are shocked when they find out. Same goes for MMOs.In Wow my main is a male chracter, again people are shocked when they find out I am female as I am top highest DPS in raids. To be fair in my raiding guild there are only 2 girls and in my more social guild there was more ladies (7:10). Are those women that don't raid  less of a gamer? No. I see them online at least an hour most days and more on the weekends. It is their passion and its what they spend their free time and money on.I think some men use the "real" gamer thing because they see that "their" space is being invaded by women and there is some male ego thing that says they need to claim a piece of it for themselves. To Define themselves as "more" or "better".

That's because gaming was and still very much is, a male based hobby. Wouldn't you find it \textbf{weird} if a couple of you're male friends gave you tips on beauty? And when you said support im going to assume you mean support class ie healer. That kind of deal. The reason, i think,people asssume most females will be a support class if for .two reasons. One, most girls ARE actually support classes. ( stereotypes don't come from nowhere). second, for the most part. Girl gamers aren't very good. There are a few girl gamers who aren't baffled the simplist of things in game.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small It would also appear you don't get it either. First of all,i had to make the generalistion because i was refering to female gamers specifically, there is no negative stigma attached to it. Second of all, both genders are to blame for the way females are portrayed. What i find ammusing is how they will carry it on until it becomes inconvinient for them. By that i mean \textbf{woman} will complain about the way they are viewed, but they'll continue to use thier bodies anyway lol. This is why thy're portrayed like that. (I don't agre with it by any means, but it's everyones fault). The last bit doesn't make any sense, i know men give \textbf{woman} tips on beauty. But im trying to say that for the most part, genders giving advice in a realm that they're not usually associated with. Will cause someone to become baffled by it.And this is also why males don't like females butting into thier shit. Because they all of a sudden have to change to everything because females don't like it. If we don't,females will tell bullshit facts( female gamers make up half the gaming population in the US, not the rest of the world).

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Jermaine Ford I know all this. I've never claimed to not know WHY people generally are soooo sexist towards women when it comes to gaming. I've said that I hate it. That's it. I said I'm not at all suprised that some men find it \textbf{weird} when I'm better at a game than they are or I teach them something, so there's no point i explaining why to me. I totally get it. What I said was that they're weirded out because I'm a girl in their territory and then you said pretty much the exact same thing. It's not really comparable with make up tho, because not nearly as many guys do make up as girls play games and most guys that DO actually do make up are professionals so even in make up some men tell us what to do and how to do it. Either way, the point is that its wrong. Most girls that I know play because they like it, that there's a few typical "gamer girls" out there who stream and use their bodies and a high pitch voice to earn money from it does not mean that anywhere close to all of us do this, or rather, most of us DON'T do this. Sadly these girls are the ones who get attention, because they want it. Obviously they're gonna be seen more often than us who just game and don't really care about being a so called girl gamer. It's not the same people btw. You were saying that we complain about how we're viewed and carry on using or bodies anyway, or something like that. NOT the same girls doing these things. There's me and girls like me who just completely hates being a girl in games, and then there's the girl who embraces it and makes it harder for the rest of us to get taken seriously. What makes it even worse is the fact that we pretty much have to be very overweight, somewhat less pretty and not concerned about beuaty to get taken seriously. It's a little annoying. Especially since my two biggest hobbies apart from music is make up and games.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Weird & \cellcolor{green!27}Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}1/363 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.275 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Yeah and the first part i agree with. But i thought it was a little convinient how the blame was placed entirley on men in your first comment. So if you don't want a comment back. Make sure you're not posting comments completely discrediting ALL male gamers. ''The thing is that in these different mobas, fps's and mmo's and such, if they find out that we are female, one of two things will happen. They will either:1. treat us as delicate flowers, not tell us off when we do something wrong, say it doesn't matter or just white knight us when someone flames. 2. Treat us as we do not belong, not give us buff's because it's a waste to them, claiming the reason we might be bad is because we're women, that we belong in the kitchen and if we're actually good it's amazing to them.''Also, if you understand it all. Why feel the need to say that you wouldn't be surprised if you told a boy something   he didn't know in gaming and was shocked? Because it's not relevant to anything. Obviously segregation exists between genders and thier respective hobbies. If you really understood you'd appreciate the male perspective as well. Also to say that the scenarios aren't comparable because not as many men do make up as females play games, is kinda \textbf{dumb}. Because your basically saying that their needs wouldn't count as much as the female gamers. Due to the lack of males interested in that specific hobbies. Which in turns shows that most people ignorant in the retarded war bewtween females and males. Simply use \textbf{sexism} as a front to further thier own ambitions. Even if the person isn't aware of it. This is what you're doing atm btw. Ignorance is bliss As to the second part. Unfortunatley i was refering to females a whole. ( i don't mean All females, just easier to make a majority generalisation.) It's difficiult to erase a stereotype that females themselves refinforced for centuries. The last part is closely linked to my first comment. You say all male gamers can be catagorised in only of two situations Despite it being wrong because their obivously are males who aren't White Knights. But yet you make the agruement of individuality to suit your case. ''NOT the same girls doing these things. There's me and girls like me who just completely hates being a girl in games, and then there's the girl who embraces it and makes it harder for the rest of us to get taken seriously.'' The very last bit is case of self worth and conifidence. If you wanna be heard and taken seriously then do it. PLus it's not true,as male and gamer I know all to all well that males will never really take a female who is \textbf{fat},ugly etc seriosuly.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Jermaine Ford What you're doing now is basically telling me I shouldn't generalise men and still you do this to women. I have never said I meant ALL men, I've never said that every single dude does these things, just that it always happens. Whether it's ONE dude in a group of ten, or five in a group of five, I never said. You shouldn't tell me I'm doing something wrong when you're doing the exact same thing. And it's not really an argument of individuality, it's basically two groups, exactly like I divided men into two groups in the first comment. There's ladies who just wanna be treated like everyone else in their games and there's girl who exploit the shit out of the fact that they're female to earn skins, money, objects, games, admin-positiions and whatnot. Then ofc theres different grey-areas of this and some migh just use their \textbf{gender} a little while for the mostpart they just wanna play and not have to deal with \textbf{sexism}. I didn't mean to put all the blame on men you know, because I know this isn't true. The question was not about gamer girls exploiting the fact that they're female tho, it was about \textbf{sexism}, so I wrote solely about the \textbf{sexism} I have to deal with. And no, ofc it's my fault that you didn't get the whole make-up thing because I'm not even sure I actually wrote it all. I have absoluitely \textbf{nothing} against men doing make-up and most girls simply do not care. Most of the time it's other men telling a dude he can't wear make up. Some of the best professonals when it comes to make up are of the male \textbf{gender} so even in beauty some men tell us what to do and when. There's \textbf{nothing} wrong with it as far as I think, but it's not really a fair comparison. There's not nearly as many men doing make up as there is female gamers, and there is not nearly as many professional female gamers as there are male make up artists. The argument to start with was that a \textbf{woman} would feel \textbf{weird} taking beauty-tips from a man, and this is not even close to true, Which was my point to begin with, apperantly I didn't do a too good job att explaining it tho.

Hwat I'm telling you is that WHEN they actually find out that I'm a girl, they either say something sexist or the whiteknight me, which is equally annoying. Pricks just being pricks I'm used to, I'm not really sensitive either. I'm so very used to it and I've been a gamer since I was 13 and I'm 21 now. Back then I liked the attention I got from being a girl, in for example wow, but with time I realized how annoying it is that I can't just be a gamer, in people's eyes, they see me as a GIRL gamer no matter what.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Amanda Drugge Well if I just said girl or just said gamer, it wouldn't really clarify that I'm talking about a girl that plays video games. And yeah, it makes no sense to treat female gamers differently, just like I find it ridiculous when ESL has tournaments only for females, since the teams don't really interact with each other, so the need is not there, as there is no difference between a man and a \textbf{woman} in gaming like there is in physically exhausting sports like football, tennis etc. where the male has a gigantic advantage just by being male. As for the term gamer girl, I don't find it to be sexist - it simply acknowledges the fact that females are very much a minority in the vast majority of multiplayer games, and therefore you don't come across female gamers that often, even in games where voice communication is the norm (making it easy to identify genders).Why would someone whiteknight you when he finds out you are a gamer girl? Well, maybe it's because of a large part of the community being immature (the younger, the more likely to be immature, fact, boys aged 17> are much more \textbf{common} than adult women in the games I imagine you having these experiences in, no matter what some hipster tells you on Ted), and therefore he wants to make sure you have a comfortable experience while playing with him, since females are generally a lot more sensitive to the shit that goes on online than men are. It is actually quite \textbf{common} everywhere for the communication and behavior to change drastically once a female enters the nearby world - if you were a guy, you'd know this. Every single guy I know behaves drastically different when there are chicks around, it's a simple universal fact. Realize when you're on guy territory, expect male behavior - and that includes offensive comments based on simple things that don't matter - males get them too, and we just laugh about it. There aren't a lot of places where we men are free to be men, so when you step on our territory, which you are more than welcome to do, you can't just expect us to change our behavior to the more sensitive people like we do almost everywhere else where we aren't "alone". Why would anyone make any assumptions about you based on your \textbf{gender}? Well, maybe it's because you're a minority that is to find almost nowhere in top competitive play, and therefore it would seem logic that you have a lesser understanding of the game - is it rational? No, but neither is much else people do. I can tell you that it is possible to find people to play with, who will not whiteknight you and will not make offensive comments, but you might wanna look into playing a different game then.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Common, Gender, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}4/483 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.828 \\  \hline

I get why they act differently, and that's \textbf{nothing} I or anybody else will be able to change, it's just simply the fact that it's usually the two extremes. Either it's horrible or it's all cute and nice, ONLY because they - like you - seem to think we can't handle normal criticism. It's not rational no, because the reason we aren't seen is because we're basically condemned as soon as we try to put foot around the bigger players. It's kind of an evil circle. We aren't seen around the top in competitive play, and therefore people keep treating us as if we can't be good at it because of our \textbf{gender}, make us play roles we don't want and such, which makes girls not wanting to, or not being able to even TRY to make it big. I mean, it would be a lot more simple if there could just every once in a while be a girl on a professional lol-team.

How is gendercide, rape as an act of war, and being sold in any way not as bad? Try not to let this become a competition and just realize that treating women this way is disgusting and stop justifying it. I never said ANYTHING about women hatred, so I never drew any paralells between wanting to protect a female and hatred of women, you did. I've never seen a \textbf{woman} treating a man differently, though they might act differently to seem more cute, It's \textbf{nothing} compared to how the two extemes of \textbf{sexism} a lot of us have to put up with. I'm not saying men are worse, just than a male in gaming is the norm so there's no reason to treat any of them/you any different, and the opposite seems to go for women. No one has ever asked you to take responsibility for how other men act, at least not here, so don't give me that. It should be obvious that when I say men, I mean SOME/MOST men withing the GAMING COMMUNITY (and I mean, I play LoL, WoW, Gmod and a few other games on and off and I haven't played with every active male gamer withing these games, so it's obviously a quite limited), not every single man on this planet or every man that has ever played a game.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Can not believe this thread is still going, geez. You need to understand, the fact that female gamers get treated better than guys in some cases is \textbf{sexism} too, and BAD. It's literally in my first post, BOTH of the two things that can happen, suck ass. I don't WANT you fucking attention, I don't WANT you to fawn over me because I'm a \textbf{woman} and I play "real" games. It's noooot wanted and most of the time it's creepy. WHAT is so hard about just treating people the same? Someone here commented that we get treated as bad as everyone else and that we just make up that it's because of our \textbf{gender}. If this was true, that we don't get treated at all differently, then why are there men who treat us better ONLY because we're female? Why are there people who flame me UNTIL they find out I'm a \textbf{woman}, then they stop? I don't care that people call me out on my mistakes, I want you to, but not because I'm a \textbf{woman}, saying shit like "girls can't play games, they belong in the kitchen" or things like that. Or jokes about them wanting to sleep with me, marry me, date me, w/e. It's horrible. Yes I realize that the stats are skewed. That doesn't excuse the behaviour tho and it honestly shouldn't outweigh everything else I made points about in my original post. Oh, and it IS a problem that there's barely any fully dressed non sexualized female characters in games (for example LoL) today. It's gotten better since I first posted all this in this game in particular (for example, more undressed men, more non sexualised and undressed females, less boobs and \textbf{thin} wastes and so on), but it's still a thing. AND lastly, the same guy who said we get treated the same already also said that I just proved to be a delicate flower by posting this. To you (prolly a dude, this one) I wanna say, telling a \textbf{woman} that she's a delicate flower for talking about something that is problematic to her and other women is LITERALLY the shit men have been doing since the dawn of time, and the reason feminism exists.

Also why its not a problem how men are dressed in video games?Why men are always clothed, not sexualized and act certain way etc. Its equally as "sexist" towards men if you so decide to call it.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Honestly why don't any of you even read before you answer. Yes it's a problem that male characters are really strong and muscly, but it's not sexualizing, it's idealizing. One of them has correlation to what society thinks about how a certain group of people should dress and be. The other has correlation to macho culturem they're both shit. So, now the two groups, female and male characters in game, have in \textbf{common} that they are usually drawn with bodies that are almost impossible to achieve (you need to wear a corset for years to get that \textbf{thin} of a waist for example). But male characters are rarely undressed to the extent of the female characters. They're not sexualized to the same extent and THAT REALLY IS THAT. Besides, this honestly isn't even the important bit because obviously we play the games anyways and we can see that it's starting to change slowly, with more 'macho' women and more sexualized men. The problem however is that women absolutely do get treated differently, I even asked a transwoman about this yesterday, she absolutely notices the difference, and how demeaning it is to be called "good for being a girl"  and get creepy attention. Guys who pretend to be female in games notice the difference, honestly wtf.Ofc theres a bunch of men telling women how it actually is, that what they experiance isn't a real experiance. This is literally like saying women and men don't get treated differently on like Tinder. U fkn stupid if you don't realize it.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I get what you're saying and I agree to a degree, but not all of them are "beta", some of them are just normal men, I know many of them personally. It's kinda problematic that you strengthen the idea that there is a certain way you need to be as a man. It's the exakt same as telling girls they need to be ladylike, no matter if your view of a "real" man is someone who respects women or someone who is macho AF. There should be NO "real men"-idea. It is literally what makes (some) men fkn \textbf{crazy}. The idea that a man NEEDS to be certain things.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small IT DOESN'T FUCKING MATTER IF WE HAVE ADVANTAGES OR DIADVANTAGES (we have both, let that be clear) IT'S STILL A FUCKING PROBLEM. Majority of us DO NOT WANT TO BE GIVEN THINGS SIMPLY BECAUSE OF OUR \textbf{GENDER} honestly WHAT is so fucking hard to understand with "we want to be treated EQUALLY"??? Equally meaning NO special treatment, no matter if it's GOOD special treatment or bad. WANT NONE OF IT. That's why soooooo fucking many of us have unisex names and don't disclose our \textbf{gender} until we legit start talking to someone who obviously had no idea and/or didn't care to begin with. And I know, as a female, with looooads of female friends who play games, that they HATE being treated differently. I hate being gifted shit from my male friends because I know they do it to hit on me, they know this, so I mostly just get gifted shit from my female friends, and I gift them back. I have once in my life (when I was 15, I'm soon to be 24 now) used the fact that I'm a girl to get 500g in wow so that I could afford artisan flying, and it didn't feel good, it felt awful, so I never did it again. You're way off. I never EVER said anything like people shouldn't be rude. I don't believe that toxic behaviour and/or flame makes anyone play better, personally I make a million more mistakes when I'm angry than when I'm just laughing at my own mistakes and having a good time. Flame makes me angry = flame makes me play worse = flame doesn't fkn help. HOWEVER, I think I said the opposite to "no one can be mean to women", I'm 100 sure I said I DO NOT want to be treated differently, meaning that if a person would flame a guy for a mistake, he should flame me too for that same mistake. THAT is treating people the same no matter their \textbf{gender}. It's only a problem when the flaming doesn't have as much to do with the skill the female has and more that she is a girl. You wouldn't tell a guy that he belongs in a kitchen or that he's "good for being a guy", and so, you really shouldn't say these things to women either. If you'd say "why did you do that idiot" to a dude, you should say the same to the girl who makes the same mistake.

It's REALLY silly to me that this whole thread consists of guys telling a \textbf{woman} how things are and what she has experienced isn't true, when that's the whole problem to begin with. You wouldn't know, unless you systematically tell people you're female to experience it. Those men that have done that AGREE that we get a looooot of creepy and mean shit thrown at us, ALONG with some 'advantages' (like creepy dudes thinking you'll ride their dick if they give you a skin or acting like you can't handle the same things as everyone so they insist you get your favorite role or lane, maybe I want to be pushed to try something different like pretty much everyone aside from supports are). Your experiences as a male has absolutely NOOOOOOOOOO meaning in a discussing about female experiences in gaming. If you think about it just a little, it's pretty clear why. Good on you tho for not caring about \textbf{gender}. I know there's a lot of people that don't let \textbf{gender} decide how you treat someone in game, and I'm glad. I also know it's gotten a lot better the past two years since I wrote the original post. But it's still there to a point that it still fucks with our experiences playing a certain game.

OH yes ofc because it's your way of saying "stupid little girl hehe I, as a man, know everything, listen to me". I don't like the word mansplaining but it's literally what you just did. Don't you think I know there are rude people irl? Rude people in general are not the problem. It's NOT one person, similar things happen all the time, and that's a pattern that strongly proves that not mainly gaming itself, but the community, is sexist. I just need you to think about what you're all doing. I mean this honestly. I'm not saying this to prove anything or shame you or w/e, I just really want you to think about it. Do you believe that a whole \textbf{gender} just make things up for no reason whatsoever? Unless our goal was to be as comfortable as men in a certain area, what would our goal be? Especially when it comes to this. What we want is literally for men to NOT GIVE US FREE SHIT because we're female and also to not make sexist or creepy jokes when they find out we're female. How does this hurt you in any way and why would you ever oppose it unless you felt personally attacked by what we say? How would you, as men, know better than sooo many women, what women experience in gaming? It's literally the same as with tinder. Ofc you don't feel offended that guys are disgusting as shit towards others when it not you they're disgusting towards. Yet, it's something literally every \textbf{woman} on tinder, snapchat or whatever the social media/app has happen to them, aka suprise dick pics (the equivalent to dick pics irl is illegal, not sure why it's ok online), being called names and getting insults about our appearances when we reject them and rape \& murder threats if we tell them what we think about their actions (offensive AF even when we don't actually believe they mean it). Do you deny these things aswell? Or is it just this one certain gaming thing that holds no truth?If these other things happen, WHYYYY oh why would it be so amazing to you that this is a legit problem for us? I realize that I'm mainly talking to the type of men who would call women 'honey' as a way to patronize women when talking to them in this thread so I know for a fact that you're part of the problem and that's why you don't take notice when shit happens, you're probably the one doing it, not only here, but in games aswell.

The wording is really important when you use certain words to push someone else down.

It's not a couple of people, dude, it's a whole lot of people, enough that it ruins my gaming experience almost every time a male stranger finds out my \textbf{gender}. Hence my unisex nickname in games. And lastly, yes, mansplaining is a thing. I thnk you know exactly what it is. It is when a man explains something to a \textbf{woman} in a patronizing way. Expecially things that are basic. Like what you said which was basically "people are rude sometimes". So, mansplaining, you did it. It's really magical seeing men thinking they for some reason know more than women when they personally have no insight in the matter whatsoever.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I need you to understand that I absolutely understand that men have problems. They have problems in other areas mostly. Men can absolutely be sexualized but reality is that they aren't as much in gaming. I said that as long as male and female characters were sexualized equally, that would be fine. Either all of them should be, or none of them should. And if they are, they should have an equal counterpart in the other \textbf{gender}. This is the problem with men like you. YOU CAN NOT TELL ME that I don't care about men and only ever actually talk about your (men's) problems whenever a \textbf{woman} talks about ours. PLEASE for the love of god let us tell you what is a problem without you telling us we're wrong (because you for some reason know better, tho \textbf{nothing} you say ever contradicts or disproves anything I've said) or saying stuff like "what about men". It just proves what we've been saying all along, literally we can't ever take any space without men feeling offended that we do. You absolutely have the right to talk about your problems but in this area it's literally all non problems. "we can get scammed by men faking being girls" YEAH this wouldn't be a problem if you did like we asked and didn't give us shit because of our \textbf{gender}. "everyone's an asshole" yeeeah but not everyone is an asshole based on your \textbf{gender} and makes jokes about it and/or make you feel like you don't belong because you don't have a dick. "people talk less to guys" yeah because they don't want to have \textbf{sex} with you simply because you are of your \textbf{gender} and play games, we don't just get friendly talk, we get creepy talk. Be glad. Me stating we have issues and that your issues in this same area aren't as big is NOT SEXIST. I'm not treating any of you differently because you're all a bunch of dudes. If you started talking to me about something totally different, about make up or w/e, I'd never act as if you don't belong or make jokes about your \textbf{gender}. I'd never stereotype you. The things I say, I say with your statements as basis. You NEED to realize that me stating that men have less issues than women have in gaming is not stating men don't have problems at all and that only women have it hard. I fully recognize that men deal with a \textbf{crazy} amount of pressure their whole life to provide for their families and women, that you get pushed down when you show feelings to the degree that a lot of men can't cry (and they even seem proud of it often times), that you're pushed to show your strength all your life and some of you become violent because of it. I realize more men commit suicide because of this, and lose custody of their children when they shouldn't because society seems to think that women are naturally closer to their children OR  that the men have been away working too much, trying to provide for their kids. I realize more men die at their jobs, because they do more dangerous work, because society expects them too, because "men are strong". I realize it's fucked how they still in many parts of the world still save women and children first, as if men have less of a value. I know men are raped and both physically and mentally abused a lot, and that they are too afraid to report it because they often times get disbelief and straigh up laughter. It's fucked up. I know. I've forgotten many things here obviously, but I just wanted to make you aware that I, and women like me, DO CARE. When we say we're about equality, most of us actually are, and are not about matriarchy. You don't have to believe me ofc, but I really wish you could. And I really wish that you could also see that I'm not being \textbf{blind} to your side of things only because I'm talking about problems WE experience. Ours and your problems are two sides of the same coin and even if I didn't personally care too much about men's problems, It would be really difficult not too since ours and yours so often are connected in different ways. I know this was rather off topic and one hell of a TL;DR, but I think it's important. With all this said, I fully respect that when it comes to men's issues, you know better than I do, for example what it's like growing up with the macho ideal being shoved down your throat, because I have nooo idea, even if I think I've witnessed it enough to know to a degree. I will never, since I've never been in that situation. In that same way, you couldn't possibly know how often these things happen to girls in gaming and how much it bothers us. I know for a fact that you do not get the same thing. Maybe being scammed is not the same thing as being pursued by a creepy dude because he found out you're a girl. And it's not the same as being told/thought of straight away, that you suck at a game and should play support because of your \textbf{gender}. Ultimately because "maybe being scammed" by someone pretending to be a girl was your decision. Meaning, you actively decided to give a girl online something because of their \textbf{gender}.  You shouldn't have.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small First off, I want to say that most of the response Carolyn Petit received when reviewing GTAV was absolutely disgusting. Just because someone is transgendered doesn't make their opinion any less credible. I watched her review of the game, and I felt she did an excellent and thorough job critiquing the game's strengths and flaws.Now, onto the \textbf{sexism} and \textbf{misogyny} in GTAV…Yes, there are definitely parts of the game that are degrading to women. But has anyone thought that maybe the \textbf{sexism} is in there to PROVE A POINT? Maybe hold a mirror up to society and show people how the world CAN and DOES work at times? Maybe art imitates life? Could it have been used, dare I say, SATIRICALLY? You know, instead of the "fuck women" attitude?Look, I'm not saying that games CAN'T be offensive or bad. But there's this important thing called CONTEXT. Just as important, ART IS SUBJECTIVE, and people need to get these things through their heads before they start bashing something and looking at everything through a discrimination filter.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Misogyny, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/178 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.685 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small 1) Just because it has male leads and no female leads doesn't make it sexist, he had that right.2) Using \textbf{sex} appeal and an attractive \textbf{woman} to attract the male audience, because it is a marketing strategy, is not sexist. The GTA players are, I reckon, mainly dudes. So because they used a \textbf{woman} in bikini instead of a man in trunks, it's sexist. I thought it was rather sexist towards the \textbf{woman} in question by saying that.3) There are plenty of non important female npcs and non important male npcs. Just because the npcs that stand out your opinion are the hookers, housewives, whatever does not mean the game is sexist. And seriously, this "non realistic view" is actually not so unrealistic. I'm pretty damn sure there are a prostitutes in societies so I don't see how that's objectifying women. It's like saying because I made a \textbf{black} male as a criminal in a game that I'm being \textbf{racist}. What the actual hell?4) A game's often not in any way related to reality, but simply inspired from reality. It has a lot of caricatures. In the first place, the media resorts to many different strategies to make money off celebrities, such as adultery and slander. Why are you so offended? Because the "victim" is a \textbf{woman}? Second of all, it's a mother fucking game. Would you find it more fun to chase someone around the city, do risky things that you probably would never do in real life or make your character sit down on a chair and use the computer? \textbf{Common} sense the former two are better.5) There are sexist characteristics in this game. And it's not just towards women. It's the internet, do you think that in real life people would go to your face constantly to tell you that you are wrong? No, they ignore you or confront you politely! In real life, people tend to flock with others that share the same opinion. On the internet, different opinions clash! And I haven't seen the review, but I do know that taking internet comments to justify a cause is immensely stupid and ridiculous. It's the internet, a place that is not respectful and very rude, and where people will not kiss your ass on everything you say. Imagination and creation shouldn't be limited by such crude limitations. By the way, people do not become video game characters. You do not become who you play and watch. We know it's an entertainment. You know what else? If a male Lara Croft was created, with the same characteristics as her, except male, no one, and I mean, no one would say he's a good role model.

Men who play games are less likely to refer to themselves as a 'gamer' if they play casually, while women who play the most casual games on and off like The Sims consider themselves among the elite of all gamers. There are no games companies actively excluding female gamers, whereas you're making it seem like there are.There's an obvious difference between the mindset of each \textbf{gender} when it comes to gaming and historically, the main \textbf{gender} of hardcore gamers is male. Only recently, ever since it's become 'cool' for women to play games and more 'acceptable' for anyone to do so, have the numbers of women gamers have increased.Women are late to the game on this and developers make whatever they want, so why is there a need to pander to women because they don't like certain games \textbf{Nobody} complains that a Tarantino movie is too violent, because that's what they expect from it. So why complain about \textbf{sexism} in GTA V? This is the series that glorified hiring prostitutes and then murdering them so you could get your money back, you should expect that sort of thing.The poster girl from GTA V can also hardly be criticised, or you have to make the point that almost every single company uses \textbf{sex} to sell. Check out any cologne or perfume ad, any clothing label (male or female) and even any soap advertisements. The problem isn't with gaming or \textbf{sexism}, it's a proven formula continued by marketing departments simply because it works.Also, the quoted messages are from people clearly from 4chan, which, from a simple search can be shown that was the case.Just like the \textbf{old} men sitting in a room being forced to try accept games as a legitimate form of art, you're spouting wildly overstated tall tales to these people. Princess Zelda controlling Link, dressing up as a dude and saving him? Never happened. Since you're referring to Sheik, it's assumed that you're referring to OoT. Link's quest began before he ever met Zelda and everything required in story to give him the motivation was present before they met, too. Zelda only provided him the information about the Temple of Time and gave him the OoT and the means to travel to Death Mountain. This has gone for long enough, so I won't bother explaining Sheik's story in OoT, but will mention that you should know it and sure as hell shouldn't lie about it when you're trying to get people to take you seriously.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender, Nobody, Old, Sex, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s, Age - Youngsters, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}7/449 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.559 \\  \hline

There will be males who call you out for being a female giving statements such as, you must be playing on your brothers/bf's system, or I'M NOT LETTING YOU DRIVE CAUSE GIRLS ARE TERRIBLE DRIVERS! but there's also the female community who to me seems like they get offended when another female is in the lobby trying to "fight" for alpha female player in the all male lobby.

You have more economic power than men because 80 of consumer goods purchased are done so by women due to the fact that you have you money and your husbands, fathers and boyfriends money to spend.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Okay, a couple of thoughts I had during watching this include:The game =  = the storyline in the game. The "game is sexist" is a blanket statement, where I think the correct statement should be, "some of the characters, in the storyline, are sexist."He implies that the world is a sand box but you "cannot choose to be a prick", as though it was a sand box-RPG, it isn't, it's a storyline based crime simulator. "sand box" only describes the gameplay mechanics, \textbf{nothing} else.He then goes on to say the male characters have agency, when a great chunk of the missions are actually them, against their will, being manipulated into doing missions they don't want to do, showing they have no control/agency of their own.Them being "redeemed" is a strange phrasing, as there is \textbf{nothing} to show them being redeemed, at all, in anyway. Not being caught =  = Being "redeemed"He actively acknowledges all the characters in the storyline are monstersThere are as many moments that actively shame men, including the threatening of rape to JohnnyK, as well as possibly even raping Floyd.Trevor, himself, turned out to be suppressed by his mother, actually in love twice, \& discourages the use of "bitch" around him.Michael's wife was just as unfaithful to him, as he was to her. Jimmy was as bad off as his sister, Tracey, only different.Franklin mourns the loss of his one-time girlfriend, to the point he still has a picture of them together, at his bedside, even though she's moved on/getting married.This game is rated mature, \& the storyline is very adult. Why should "girls" even be playing it? Is he saying he wants "girls" in the storyline itself? Children, in a GTA? He can't be serious.\& finally, if he likes the idea of "video games as art", he can't hope to control the vision of the "artist". The people he knows who say the game isn't "satire" have no more a valid opinion than the "artists" who find their humor satirical.Did he really incite violence against people who question the statistics at the end?\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}2/361 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.554 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Nice video. As a gamer I'll say that there are generally two types of female gamers I've came across. Those who are gamers, then those who fit the 'gamer girl' mold. That mold as I've seen since Diablo 2 back in 1999 is literally those who fall back on being a girl to woo guys into giving them items, gear, helping them through things they can't do on their own.The ones who are simply gamers, well, it's hard or impossible to tell them apart unless they point it out or you're on a VOIP while playing with them. Most of them I've known won't admit to being female publicly in competitive gaming because of how heavily they're raged at and called liars because a guy's ego can't handle being owned by a female. lolAnd yeah, there's a lot of \textbf{sexism} in gaming... some has a viable place, but not all. I belong to a large gaming community (over 1000 members) and a lot of those I've met and talked to are female and many of them agree with the two paragraphs I put above. Even had a couple laugh at me on Teamspeak, them admit they're a gamer girl because they'll start prodding their boyfriend/husband/other guys to help them out. On the other foot, there's a couple I talk to regularly that continually school others in BF4 and the WvWvW of Guild Wars 2.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/236 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.424 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small In inspired talk from a man I didn't know before this. I was very pleased with the whole video, and \textbf{sexism} is a real issue in the gaming industry.There's a lot of comments on here trying to defend the POV of men in the gaming world. How there's \textbf{nothing} wrong with their male characters and how it bashes all of the characters. However, that it does not do so equally is the point. When women are harshly verbally abused and their jobs threatened simply for stating that \textbf{sexism} exists in this media? That's when you know something is wrong. It's true women are devalued and dehumanised in some of these games.And if you don't believe in rape culture then you have never truly talked to a \textbf{woman} who has been raped by someone she trusted and thought loved her, put down by her parents and told it is her fault when men assault her, told the way she dresses or talks or the things she likes are wrong.My point is, just because you don't see examples of these things daily, as they happen, doesn't mean they aren't there. These are important issues and addressing them one step at a time is the only way to go. Because our society is too set in its ways to take it down all at once.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nothing, Sexism, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}4/225 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.778 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small My humble two cents. Rockstar have repeatedly featured female leads and supporting characters in their games, who show actual personality traits, character growth and aren't just there to make goo-goo eyes at the male leads. The lack of such female characters in GTA V is odd, but not sexist. Including a female character for the sole reason of '\textbf{gender} equality' or pointing out the lack of such is just as sexist.Lastly, the accusation isn't quite accurate. Michael's wife, Amanda, is a reasonably strong character. She does not simply exist to enable Michael; quite the opposite, she actively berates him for his terrible behaviour. She has her own motivations and has redeeming qualities. I don't believe the game is sexist, as nearly EVERY character is portrayed negatively, and the semi-redemption of the male leads is as a result of them being main characters, not because of their \textbf{gender}. Imagine the backlash if Trevor had been a \textbf{woman}.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/157 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.274 \\  \hline

Deliberately excluding women from a setting would be sexist.You need to read my comment again. Considering that Rockstar have had strong female characters in past games (and at least one strong female supporting character in GTA V), I doubt that the lack of female lead characters was a deliberate, sexist decision.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Sexism & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/79 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.266 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@45calGunslinger I think I get your point there, it's one that has always intrigued me about \textbf{gender} equality.Let's put things like this : in your group of 8 workers, whose work is building cupboards, the law says you have to hire 4 men and 4 women. How cool, this law makes women and men equals, yay!But what if there are 6 men wanting this awesome cupboard-making job, who are all better for this job than the 5 postulating women? It means 2 men won't get the job they deserve for the sake of \textbf{gender} equality?But then, is this really what you can call equality? Doesn't that even become sexist towards men, since women are priviledged?In the same way, I feel like it isn't fair to always urge the use of more female leaders in movies, games, etc.Don't get me wrong, there is a part of truth in everything Paul Verhoeven says. But the solution to \textbf{sexism} is not as simple as filling quotas of 50/50. And an underrepresentation of women in a game doesn't make me think the developers are sexists, because it must be the case for some of them, but you can't tell with such observations. Also it's been said that videogames are now more and more labeled as work of art. Hell, to some extent, let the devs create the characters they want, if they feel like having 3 dudes as main protagonists, I don't see why they'd be like "Hm.. Forget it, we have to include a \textbf{woman} here.". In the same way that painting only male subjects rarely is an issue to anyone.Actually, I think real \textbf{gender} equality would be the complete unawareness of differences between women \& men. Like perceiving everybody either as hermaphrodites or asexual beings. Because a character being cool because "damn, it's a \textbf{woman}, it's uncommon", is also sexist. A character should be awesome because of his being, but regardless of his \textbf{gender}.A female Trevor shouldn't be perceived as better than a male Trevor, or the opposite, because we should just find Trevor's personnality the exact same in both cases.What makes us think one or the other is better is because of all the thoughts we already have about what it is to be a man and what it is to be a \textbf{woman}, thoughts we've been raised to think.So I don't think we can reach that complete equality, but we can still try to come closer to it.(That being said, I'd find the idea of a new GTA with a bad-ass female main character, litterally kickin' balls, awesome.)(And sorry if I made some mistakes, English isn't my native language.And I'll feel pretty \textbf{dumb} if you tell me I totally missed your point.Anyway, it became more a statement of my own vision than one of yours.)\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Dumb, Gender, Sexism, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}9/478 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.883 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small It's an insightful video, but there are definitely some points that need to be touched on. Most notably the constant undertone that adding women to video games etc will someone how improve the quality, which is only objectively true from the perspective that it promotes equality, where in a creative scenario, the \textbf{gender} of a hero should be chosen based on the personality and story of your hero. Further to that point, there are clearly some heros in EVERY media form that would have been better depicted with the opposite \textbf{gender}. It's also a terrible idea to use GTA as an example point for video-game \textbf{sexism}, due to the fact that the sole aim for grand theft auto is to be distasteful and confronting in its disregard for racial/sexual equality, and to at times amplify the class gaps in modern times to bizarre extremes. It is not a good game for proving any point except how tasteless humans as a total can be. He also neglects to touch at all on the fact that video game \textbf{sexism} is a very \textbf{old} "culture" based on the fact that at one point in time women were the minority in online gaming, and where as that has moved onto balance, the gaming mentality has missed a few beats. Instead of really discussing this with any merit he lots angry gamers into derogatory stereotypes and creates a null pendulum effect to just insult the other body of gamers. In reality, very few of these people are truly harmful people, more often a combination of idiots and elitists who determine that playing games on any platform other than their prefered platform means it is not a "proper game" instead of really addressing the mentality behind it, he says "feel free to hit them" In reality, platform elitism is an issue totally irrelevant to \textbf{sexism}, as its normally an opinion impressed on ANYBODY who will listen. Realistically speaking, a lot of debate and butting heads of feminism in gaming is almost null, there is a problem undoubtedly, but I believe people generally redirect the issue into \textbf{dumb} shit that isn't realistically a problem. IE the girl on the GTA cover. Yes, they sold the game with a piece of \textbf{sex} appeal thrown in, of course they do, everyone does, and its no bigger issue than the topless pictures of Taylor Lautner used to promote Twilight. All these things do is steal attention from legitimate concerns like the discrimination against female gamers in online communities, and the disturbingly low number of games being created to fulfil a female fantasy. (that said in the context of a stereotypical war game fulfilling masculine notions of fighting and heroics and badarsery etc, and as a counter to this there are very few games released with a purpose of creating a world with the intention of drawing in and engaging a female audience.)getting too long endrant.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Dumb, Gender, Old, Sex, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}8/486 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.646 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I think the topic of \textbf{sexism} within games is a tough nut, that cant be gotten rid of so easily. I see what he is getting at, but I don't agree.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small No, it isn't sexist towards men that they are the only ones being killed. In environments where the game is based off of historical events, WWII genres and the like, it displays policy and the mindset that women are not combat capable, and therefore do not deserve warrior/solider status, and therefore will not be seen as people killed by war, despite women being combat-capable, and also numerous casualties. In games where combat is not based after any particular event, devs and players find it far more plausible that women would only fulfill the role of sexy computer-program sidekick than warrior, even with super-space armor. In the cases where there is A single \textbf{woman} who fights, she is usually the exception. It's very rare that you'll find bots, friend or foe, that will be women. Which is stupid, cause we make up over half the population and all that jazz.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Thunar CorvidsTo acknowledge the industry has been adding female enemies but nowhere near as male ones.And yes my point was to cause you to go \textbf{crazy} over "killing women".In reality i wouldn't even dream of hurting a \textbf{woman} because i was raised right ..or..in a very conservative way as you may call it, be it good or bad.But this is the problem. Men are most protagonists as they are most enemies - just like in RL where men are top A and bottom Z on the social ladder.Men are the "random factor" we take huge risks and sometimes it pays off - A grade and sometimes life spits in our faces, the bottom people.Do you think homeless men like to be poor?Or that they don't have "motivation" ?This whole set of thinking , of claiming women aren't equal...with the TOP men is incredibly hypocritical and self-serving.For example i can always complain i am not as rich and powerful as oh i dunno, say that \textbf{fat} billionaire \textbf{woman} from Australia ( or whatever his name ).Do i compare ALL men to her and her kind and claim that : "hey i want to have equal representation ( wtf does that even mean in a capitalism economy ?!?!?! ) on the corporate board.Another thing that strikes  me and i know i am going off the rails with this but bear with me."\textbf{gender} quotas and equal representation in a company's board room".I'm sorry, but do you understand how a CAPITALIST system works?We put people there that bring benefits to the company and fuck the workers and customers.Men or women.The fact that there are more MEN means simply that men can easily override their natural caring instinct for others or they have found men with less empathy than women with less empathy.It's not a "boyz club", it's not a "restrictive club of \textbf{old} men".There ISN'T some grand conspiracy at work here. This is why all this narrative sounds like David Duke stuff.Oh there's a conspiracy to keep us down, \textbf{patriarchy} and the men are ditching better qualified women because...reasons.Wtf..sigh rant over..\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Crazy, Fat, Gender, Old, Patriarchy, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments, Physical Identity - Physical Features & \cellcolor{green!5}7/368 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.902 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@cr4yv3n ...I'm a bit confused about the point of your little rant.  Are you saying that \textbf{sexism} doesn't exist because more men are homeless?  "The fact that there are more MEN means simply that men can easily override their natural caring instinct for others or they have found men with less empathy than women with less empathy."  Oh my god, do you think that we're a bunch of walking uterus?!?  That is complete bullshit first of all, and second of all it only furthers my point that men will avoid hiring women because they think we are weak and over-emotional.  Also, you can't possibly use the logic "because in real life..." because these are fucking video games.  I can slaughter dragons and have godlike powers in a video game.  I can't do that 'IRL'.  Also, there is \textbf{sexism} oozing from every fucking corner 'IRL' so your logic is clearly flawed.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/150 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.333 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small While the guy makes a lot of good points, here's the thing with GTA V.It's clear the people who made it did so without thinking about the game's themes, and how \textbf{racist}, sexist, offensive in any shape or form it might be. So with that said....I say fuck it.If the developer isn't really trying to make something for the sake of art, then try not to critique as such. You'd be better off trying to do that with other games, where a lot more thought was put into the atmosphere and the immersion of the world.Just my take on it....even so, wtf internet?\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/106 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.943 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Well I see two obvious problems with your argument.First,saying that something is not bad simply because it was not intended to be bad makes no actual sense.If someone is being \textbf{racist} and doesnt know it his still a \textbf{racist},a really dum \textbf{racist} but still a \textbf{racist}.The second is that Rockstar has always made games with strong political messages.In pretty much every GTA game they make huge efforts to make fun of the society we live in.Even in this game there is a big focus on social inequalities and the inability of an individual to escape the economic situation that he was put in.So if they can be big boys about that I dont see why they couldn't handle other difficult questions with equal care.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}4/124 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.226 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I agree. GTA is based on silly cliches from gangsta/crime movies. Women as detailed characters simply isn't a thing in the genre. It'd definitely be good if one of the characters in the next GTA was a \textbf{woman} but they do have to admit that it'd be a bit innovative/risky so it's fair enough that it hasn't been done.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/59 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.695 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I do, actually, and I used to live down the road from Rockstar North's studios in Edinburgh. The problem with it being a british-made satirical view of American culture is that a lot of people DON'T see it as satire, they just see a big violent sexist game - and since it's been praised by SO many people as being an amazing singleplayer game with a brilliant narrative, \textbf{nobody} can use the excuse "Oh, but it wasn't meant to be serious"\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nobody & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}1/81 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.235 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small You have to prove the culture is bad first. Countless studies show just how negligible the effects of video games have on human behavior. \textbf{Nobody} who pushes this narrative has yet to provide evidence to show a causal relationship between video games and \textbf{sexism}, so we don't have a reason to believe you. Objectification just sounds like another way to say "\textbf{sex} is wrong" and ignores why issues like \textbf{sexism} even exist. Not even some feminists agree with this argument, they would rather a \textbf{sexual} women not represent a negative thing, whether it be a slut or is objectifying herself, and erase the stigma on \textbf{sex}.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nobody, Sex, Sexism, Sexual & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}6/106 & \cellcolor{green!5}5.66 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@michalovesanime I'm all for equality in Videogames please don't misconstrue that from my previous rushed comment. I'm working on a project atm with a couple of girl gamers in the UK, starting up a new youtube channel. I love how Lara croft has dialled it down and become more human now they have a lead female designer. But he doesn't talk about games that do have equality in male/female characters(Dragon \textbf{Age}, Mass Effect), he just goes after the usual media flogged horse GTA and if it wasn't so controversial that game especially wouldn't do as well as it does.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/99 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.01 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small don't be daft. He's clearly a gamer so he would be stereotyping himself as well as you. There's a difference between making a joke and trying to marginalising people. I was talking to my friend, CloudCuckooCountry, about this. he is far more eloquent then I am and this is what he had to say:"The difference is in what Derrida called the absent presence.An absent presence at its simplest understanding is a part of the text left unsaid, but which the implications of the text led back to. In the case of marginalization, the absent presence is a hierarchical power differential (as in; that one particular group of people is somehow objectively superior or inferior to another group of people).For example: if I were to make a joke about women, I would never explicitly say that 'Women are stupider than men, women are inferior to men, women are… etc' but the contents of my joke may contain a type of wording or a turn of phrase that makes an implication. And the implication turns a statement like 'women are stupider than men' from something which is unsaid to an absent presence; something which is said in subtext, something which is brought into the conversation as a truth, without anyone declaring it to be a truth.If I were to make a joke, any joke, the person listening should be able to tell me what grand narrative I've implied without explicitly saying it. As such, I (a man) can make a joke about women (the other, in the context of me) and imply a grand narrative (masculine superiority) and thus make a marginalizing joke. In such a case, even if I never explicitly disrespect women, someone would be justified in calling me out as a sexist.That's not to say that all jokes about \textbf{sex} or \textbf{gender} are sexist. It's possible to make a joke about \textbf{sex} or \textbf{gender} that doesn't contain an absent presence which invokes a hierarchical power differential. But you need to analyze the joke before you can declare whether or not it contains this.P.S. There's also explicit marginalization, but that's far more blatantly obvious to identify. I'm assuming your concern is when someone justifies marginalization by dismissing it as 'just a joke'."Cloud was talking about making sexist jokes vs making jokes about \textbf{gender} but the argument is the same for any joke that could be offensive. The "absent presence" that was left unsaid by this video is that Paul Verhoeven is a gamer himself and doesn't believe that the stereotypes he joked about are prevalent.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender, Sex & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}5/434 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.152 \\  \hline
