  \cellcolor{green!27}\small How can you call her anti-Semitic? She is likely more Semitic than Netenyahu. The bible says the devil will deceive the world. First of all Semitic is not a group of people it is a family of languages indigenous to Africa. Aramaic, Arabic, Hebrew, Amharic, Tegri, and about 400 others spoken Africa.The Zionists rule our country and have infiltrated the Christian Church. Any bible scholar knows the Jews are descendants from the European Kazarian Kingdom. In 740 AD they converted to Judaism under King Bulan. For hundreds of years they ruled a region between the Caspian and \textbf{Black} Sea. They converted to Judaism the same way Donald Trump's daughter did. These imposters have no genetic, historical, or archeological connections to the Biblical Hebrews. The Christian church remains silent because if these European imposters are exposed; then people will ask who and where are the Hebrew Israelites.First of all they would look like Rep. Omar. The biblical Hebrews were Negros. Israel is in Africa despite attempts to redefine it as the middle east. Moses was raised as Pharaohs Grandson and all the Pharaoh's of that era were Negros. Pharaoh had order the murder of all Hebrew baby boys of Moses \textbf{age}. Their was no physical differences between Hebrews, Egyptian, and Ethiopian people. When Moses true identity was discovered he fled into the wilderness. While resting at the well he helped the Shepard girls water their flock. When they return home early their father ask them, " how is it you are back home so soon". They answered an Egyptian helped us. They thought he was Egyptian because Moses fled with the clothes on his back. He was still wearing Egyptian clothes. Moses married an Ethiopian \textbf{woman}. King Salomon and Sheba first born son Maliki became the first King of Ethiopia. European were desperate to white wash history. For this lie to work they had to make the Egyptians and the Israelites white. This served the Kazarian European Jews and the Christian church. In many European countries that were not invested in the exploitation of Africa and it's people; you find \textbf{Black} Madonna and Messiah.The Catholic Church decided to change the image of the Messiah. Pope Alexander VI commission a new European image of the Messiah. It was a big deal so a heated competition between DaVinci and Michelangelo ended with DaVinci winning the contract because he was rumored to be the lover of the Pope's son Cesare Borgia. The image of the Christ that is on a billion pictures is the \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} son of Pope Alexander. Why would the Hebrew people ever go to Europe. When threatened they always fled to Egypt and when Jerusalem was destroyed by the Romans they fled in to south and west Africa where you can find the tribes today. These Africans pass the Genetic test and they still follow Hebrew traditions. The very first maps of Africa commissioned by European Kings shows a section of West Africa called the Kingdom of Judah. Now this is where the story gets interesting. When the slave trade started we are told other \textbf{African} sold other \textbf{African} tribes into slavery. The truth that will shatter all we know today is the first slaves brought to the Western Hemisphere were the tribe of Judah. Yes, the hated blacks of the America's are directly decendant of the tribe of Judah.The imposter Netenyahu stood before Congress claming Moses led his people, but Moses never went to Poland. Netenyahu whose real name was Millenkosky before his father changed it to sound Hebrew.Some say they are our allies. I need only point out how they have spied on us for decades and then sold those secrets to our strategic enemies. Russia received the bulk of these secrets in exchange for allowing more Jews to immigrate to Israel.During the Iraq war they were caught trying to steal secrets about our troop placements in Iraq. Intending to assist insurgents kill American troops. Even more dramatic was the 1967 attack on the USS LIBERTY. They made every attempt to sink this ship and blame it on the Egyptians during the Arab Israeli war. The ship was clearly American and many sailors lost their lives as the Israeli Airforce and Navy mercilessly killed many American sailors.If you are an American patriot you can not stand by and let this foreign power use us for their evil goals.Jerrod Kushner is a traitor and he is setting us up for conflict with every country around Israel. Iraq, Libya, Iran, Syria must be destroyed and they used ISIS and American to do it. ISIS has attacked Christians and MUSLIMS; but never Israel and no one seems to think something is strange about this \textbf{terrorist} organization never throwing even one pebble at Israel but swear war on everyone else.If you are a Christian please realize they use your love of Jesus to manipulate American politics.Also realize Jesus was not the Messiah name and the bible clearly predicted this great identity theft. Revelations 2:9 and 3:9 clearly calls these people as the synagogue of Satan.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}African, Age, Black, Gay, Terrorist, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Ethnicity - Black, Gender - General, Religious Identity - Muslim, Sexual Identity - General, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality & \cellcolor{green!27}45/852 & \cellcolor{green!27}5.282 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small He called and over a million \textbf{black} men showed up.How can you call her anti-Semitic? She is likely more Semitic than Netenyahu. The bible says the devil will deceive the world. First of all Semitic is not a group of people it is a family of languages indigenous to Africa. Aramaic, Arabic, Hebrew, Amharic, Tegri, and about 400 others spoken Africa.The Zionists rule our country and have infiltrated the Christian Church. Any bible scholar knows the Jews are descendants from the European Kazarian Kingdom. In 740 AD they converted to Judaism under King Bulan. For hundreds of years they ruled a region between the Caspian and \textbf{Black} Sea. They converted to Judaism the same way Donald Trump's daughter did. These imposters have no genetic, historical, or archeological connections to the Biblical Hebrews. The Christian church remains silent because if these European imposters are exposed; then people will ask who and where are the Hebrew Israelites.First of all they would look like Rep. Omar. The biblical Hebrews were Negros. Israel is in Africa despite attempts to redefine it as the middle east. Moses was raised as Pharaohs Grandson and all the Pharaoh's of that era were Negros. Pharaoh had order the murder of all Hebrew baby boys of Moses \textbf{age}. Their was no physical differences between Hebrews, Egyptian, and Ethiopian people. When Moses true identity was discovered he fled into the wilderness. While resting at the well he helped the Shepard girls water their flock. When they return home early their father ask them, " how is it you are back home so soon". They answered an Egyptian helped us. They thought he was Egyptian because Moses fled with the clothes on his back. He was still wearing Egyptian clothes. Moses married an Ethiopian \textbf{woman}. King Salomon and Sheba first born son Maliki became the first King of Ethiopia. European were desperate to white wash history. For this lie to work they had to make the Egyptians and the Israelites white. This served the Kazarian European Jews and the Christian church. In many European countries that were not invested in the exploitation of Africa and it's people; you find \textbf{Black} Madonna and Messiah.The Catholic Church decided to change the image of the Messiah. Pope Alexander VI commission a new European image of the Messiah. It was a big deal so a heated competition between DaVinci and Michelangelo ended with DaVinci winning the contract because he was rumored to be the lover of the Pope's son Cesare Borgia. The image of the Christ that is on a billion pictures is the \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} son of Pope Alexander. Why would the Hebrew people ever go to Europe. When threatened they always fled to Egypt and when Jerusalem was destroyed by the Romans they fled in to south and west Africa where you can find the tribes today. These Africans pass the Genetic test and they still follow Hebrew traditions. The very first maps of Africa commissioned by European Kings shows a section of West Africa called the Kingdom of Judah. Now this is where the story gets interesting. When the slave trade started we are told other \textbf{African} sold other \textbf{African} tribes into slavery. The truth that will shatter all we know today is the first slaves brought to the Western Hemisphere were the tribe of Judah. Yes, the hated blacks of the America's are directly decendant of the tribe of Judah.The imposter Netenyahu stood before Congress claming Moses led his people, but Moses never went to Poland. Netenyahu whose real name was Millenkosky before his father changed it to sound Hebrew.Some say they are our allies. I need only point out how they have spied on us for decades and then sold those secrets to our strategic enemies. Russia received the bulk of these secrets in exchange for allowing more Jews to immigrate to Israel.During the Iraq war they were caught trying to steal secrets about our troop placements in Iraq. Intending to assist insurgents kill American troops. Even more dramatic was the 1967 attack on the USS LIBERTY. They made every attempt to sink this ship and blame it on the Egyptians during the Arab Israeli war. The ship was clearly American and many sailors lost their lives as the Israeli Airforce and Navy mercilessly killed many American sailors.If you are an American patriot you can not stand by and let this foreign power use us for their evil goals.Jerrod Kushner is a traitor and he is setting us up for conflict with every country around Israel. Iraq, Libya, Iran, Syria must be destroyed and they used ISIS and American to do it. ISIS has attacked Christians and MUSLIMS; but never Israel and no one seems to think something is strange about this \textbf{terrorist} organization never throwing even one pebble at Israel but swear war on everyone else.If you are a Christian please realize they use your love of Jesus to manipulate American politics.Also realize Jesus was not the Messiah name and the bible clearly predicted this great identity theft. Revelations 2:9 and 3:9 clearly calls these people as the synagogue of Satan.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African, Age, Black, Gay, Terrorist, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Ethnicity - Black, Gender - General, Religious Identity - Muslim, Sexual Identity - General, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality & \cellcolor{green!5}10/862 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.16 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Raul Tiangson By definition Farrakhan can't be anti-Semitic because Arabic speakers are semetic and Mecca is in a semetic country. I am sorry if you feel put down by my comments but I am tired of this lie. European Jews are not semetic. They are certainly decendants of the Kazarian Kingdom. They are converts that stole the identity of the true Hebrews. The true Hebrews are coming to an end of their second captivity. Yah is waking up the true Hebrews. Deep down in our genetics was embedded a wake up call. The bible says the Hebrew people would forget who they are. Does that sound like the Jews today. The bible says they will be slaves again after the Egyptian captivity. This is not going to be accepted by the church because the church white washed it's history to promote white supremacy. Europeans could not reveal that the Biblical icons including the Messiah were Negros and at the same time exploit the \textbf{African} Continent. I have no general hatred of European of Jew-ish people. I am a people person and really do love white people and Jews. It is those perpetrators who willfully deceive that should be exposed.

Revelation 2:9 and 3:9 states very clearly these people are imposters. Jacob the father of the 12 Hebrew tribes was married to an Egyptian \textbf{Negro}.

So America would join them in fight against the arabs.No one seems to remember Israel spying on American and then passing that info onto the Russian government in exchange for more Jews being allowed to immigrate to Israel.Let's not forget how they were caught trying to get strategic info on our troop placements so they could pass the info on to insurgents with the intention of giving the Iraqi insurgents a better strategic advantage to kill American troops so there wouldn't be a chance we would consider more troops in the regionTrump will go to jail when all this is finished. Netenyahu or I should say Millenkosky which is his real name before his father changed his name to sound more Hebrew and not Polish.These Jewish imposters were a perfect substitute to distract from the true identity of the \textbf{African} Hebrews.On a personal note I pray for the destruction on Levin and Hannity.

Jews reinforce the "persecution complex" in blacks for their own jewish gain. Jews and Judaism declared war on white Christianity a long time ago and have been working towards its end ever since HENCE mass 3rd world immigration, white guilting and shaming constantly in the press and in movies. They NEED "minorities" votes because they do not have the numbers themselves to accomplish what they want which is Jews on top, gentiles on the bottom, laws in effect to protect jews, like ANY and ALL jewish talk of jews conspiring, as "anti-Semitic" hate speech.

It is like they are so passionate about being jewish and the world is theirs to rule that they completely missed maybe they were just envious and should have assimilated better. Their Talmud, which rabbis have to know and teach, preaches against gentiles, Jesus, Christians, non jews which is why the jews don't knock on gentile doors asking you to come learn with them from their holy books. Judaism IS anti-Christian at its core and it is the biggest secret kept in America and especially away from Christians.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small You are ignorantHow can you call her anti-Semitic? She is likely more Semitic than Netenyahu. The bible says the devil will deceive the world. First of all Semitic is not a group of people it is a family of languages indigenous to Africa. Aramaic, Arabic, Hebrew, Amharic, Tegri, and about 400 others spoken Africa.The Zionists rule our country and have infiltrated the Christian Church. Any bible scholar knows the Jews are descendants from the European Kazarian Kingdom. In 740 AD they converted to Judaism under King Bulan. For hundreds of years they ruled a region between the Caspian and \textbf{Black} Sea. They converted to Judaism the same way Donald Trump's daughter did. These imposters have no genetic, historical, or archeological connections to the Biblical Hebrews. The Christian church remains silent because if these European imposters are exposed; then people will ask who and where are the Hebrew Israelites.First of all they would look like Rep. Omar. The biblical Hebrews were Negros. Israel is in Africa despite attempts to redefine it as the middle east. Moses was raised as Pharaohs Grandson and all the Pharaoh's of that era were Negros. Pharaoh had order the murder of all Hebrew baby boys of Moses \textbf{age}. Their was no physical differences between Hebrews, Egyptian, and Ethiopian people. When Moses true identity was discovered he fled into the wilderness. While resting at the well he helped the Shepard girls water their flock. When they return home early their father ask them, " how is it you are back home so soon". They answered an Egyptian helped us. They thought he was Egyptian because Moses fled with the clothes on his back. He was still wearing Egyptian clothes. Moses married an Ethiopian \textbf{woman}. King Salomon and Sheba first born son Maliki became the first King of Ethiopia. European were desperate to white wash history. For this lie to work they had to make the Egyptians and the Israelites white. This served the Kazarian European Jews and the Christian church. In many European countries that were not invested in the exploitation of Africa and it's people; you find \textbf{Black} Madonna and Messiah.The Catholic Church decided to change the image of the Messiah. Pope Alexander VI commission a new European image of the Messiah. It was a big deal so a heated competition between DaVinci and Michelangelo ended with DaVinci winning the contract because he was rumored to be the lover of the Pope's son Cesare Borgia. The image of the Christ that is on a billion pictures is the \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} son of Pope Alexander. Why would the Hebrew people ever go to Europe. When threatened they always fled to Egypt and when Jerusalem was destroyed by the Romans they fled in to south and west Africa where you can find the tribes today. These Africans pass the Genetic test and they still follow Hebrew traditions. The very first maps of Africa commissioned by European Kings shows a section of West Africa called the Kingdom of Judah. Now this is where the story gets interesting. When the slave trade started we are told other \textbf{African} sold other \textbf{African} tribes into slavery. The truth that will shatter all we know today is the first slaves brought to the Western Hemisphere were the tribe of Judah. Yes, the hated blacks of the America's are directly decendant of the tribe of Judah.The imposter Netenyahu stood before Congress claming Moses led his people, but Moses never went to Poland. Netenyahu whose real name was Millenkosky before his father changed it to sound Hebrew.Some say they are our allies. I need only point out how they have spied on us for decades and then sold those secrets to our strategic enemies. Russia received the bulk of these secrets in exchange for allowing more Jews to immigrate to Israel.During the Iraq war they were caught trying to steal secrets about our troop placements in Iraq. Intending to assist insurgents kill American troops. Even more dramatic was the 1967 attack on the USS LIBERTY. They made every attempt to sink this ship and blame it on the Egyptians during the Arab Israeli war. The ship was clearly American and many sailors lost their lives as the Israeli Airforce and Navy mercilessly killed many American sailors.If you are an American patriot you can not stand by and let this foreign power use us for their evil goals.Jerrod Kushner is a traitor and he is setting us up for conflict with every country around Israel. Iraq, Libya, Iran, Syria must be destroyed and they used ISIS and American to do it.

So Christopher Hitchens was/is indisputably correct the book, atbest is mediocre. Furthermore, Christopher confirms the \textbf{Quran} contained myths borrowed from the Christian and Jewish religion by 7th-century warlords to formthe Islamic religion which in turn was used to control their soldiers and people they conquered.

One simple reason is I have yet to read a verse in the \textbf{Quran} that goes beyond the knowledge  of a 7th or 8th-century individual. I mean, it is clear that Islam was created by warlords to keep control of their soldiers and people they conquered. The \textbf{Quran} is filled with intimidation to prevent Muslims from leaving the faith and this is confirmed by a well respected Muslim scholar.

It's anti injustice and anti oppression that the so called leftist Democrats and other freedom loving people's across the  world are up against. Is that wrong. But its very cunningly twisted to make it look that they are all 'anti-sremitic'. It's a master plan to distract the world from Israel's, atrocities against the Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza. Palestinians are subjected to the worst form of apartheid,  hatred, violence, killings and terrorism by the Israeli government and army. The \textbf{nation} owns a stockpile of some 400-500 nuclear weapons apart from the latest hitech weapons which they use freely against unarmed Palestinians who have \textbf{nothing} but stones and cheap home made glorified firecrackers which are described as 'rockets', and they don't even explode. So stop lying and distracting the world from Palestine's real issue by constantly camouflaging the hidden truth of the ghastly brutal occupation and terrorism of Palestinians by the newly arrived East and West Europeans.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Alan Dershowitz, while refreshing and admirable in his seemingly non-partisan defence of civil rights, has some hypocritical allegiances.

Remember that Dershowitz was implicated in the same Epstein \textbf{sex} scandal as the Clintons and Bill travelled multiple times, deliberately without security, on Epstein's Lolita Express. This is the kind of blackmailable filth that cements loyalties in politics. Conservatives should capitalise on but be very wary of Dershowitz; Trump's pro-Israel policy may be all that endears Dershowitz to the Republicans.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Satan is a God too.How can you call her anti-Semitic? She is likely more Semitic than Netenyahu. The bible says the devil will deceive the world. First of all Semitic is not a group of people it is a family of languages indigenous to Africa. Aramaic, Arabic, Hebrew, Amharic, Tegri, and about 400 others spoken Africa.The Zionists rule our country and have infiltrated the Christian Church. Any bible scholar knows the Jews are descendants from the European Kazarian Kingdom. In 740 AD they converted to Judaism under King Bulan. For hundreds of years they ruled a region between the Caspian and \textbf{Black} Sea. They converted to Judaism the same way Donald Trump's daughter did. These imposters have no genetic, historical, or archeological connections to the Biblical Hebrews. The Christian church remains silent because if these European imposters are exposed; then people will ask who and where are the Hebrew Israelites.First of all they would look like Rep. Omar. The biblical Hebrews were Negros. Israel is in Africa despite attempts to redefine it as the middle east. Moses was raised as Pharaohs Grandson and all the Pharaoh's of that era were Negros. Pharaoh had order the murder of all Hebrew baby boys of Moses \textbf{age}. Their was no physical differences between Hebrews, Egyptian, and Ethiopian people. When Moses true identity was discovered he fled into the wilderness. While resting at the well he helped the Shepard girls water their flock. When they return home early their father ask them, " how is it you are back home so soon". They answered an Egyptian helped us. They thought he was Egyptian because Moses fled with the clothes on his back. He was still wearing Egyptian clothes. Moses married an Ethiopian \textbf{woman}. King Salomon and Sheba first born son Maliki became the first King of Ethiopia. European were desperate to white wash history. For this lie to work they had to make the Egyptians and the Israelites white. This served the Kazarian European Jews and the Christian church. In many European countries that were not invested in the exploitation of Africa and it's people; you find \textbf{Black} Madonna and Messiah.The Catholic Church decided to change the image of the Messiah. Pope Alexander VI commission a new European image of the Messiah. It was a big deal so a heated competition between DaVinci and Michelangelo ended with DaVinci winning the contract because he was rumored to be the lover of the Pope's son Cesare Borgia. The image of the Christ that is on a billion pictures is the \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} son of Pope Alexander. Why would the Hebrew people ever go to Europe. When threatened they always fled to Egypt and when Jerusalem was destroyed by the Romans they fled in to south and west Africa where you can find the tribes today. These Africans pass the Genetic test and they still follow Hebrew traditions. The very first maps of Africa commissioned by European Kings shows a section of West Africa called the Kingdom of Judah. Now this is where the story gets interesting. When the slave trade started we are told other \textbf{African} sold other \textbf{African} tribes into slavery. The truth that will shatter all we know today is the first slaves brought to the Western Hemisphere were the tribe of Judah. Yes, the hated blacks of the America's are directly decendant of the tribe of Judah.The imposter Netenyahu stood before Congress claming Moses led his people, but Moses never went to Poland. Netenyahu whose real name was Millenkosky before his father changed it to sound Hebrew.Some say they are our allies. I need only point out how they have spied on us for decades and then sold those secrets to our strategic enemies. Russia received the bulk of these secrets in exchange for allowing more Jews to immigrate to Israel.During the Iraq war they were caught trying to steal secrets about our troop placements in Iraq. Intending to assist insurgents kill American troops. Even more dramatic was the 1967 attack on the USS LIBERTY. They made every attempt to sink this ship and blame it on the Egyptians during the Arab Israeli war. The ship was clearly American and many sailors lost their lives as the Israeli Airforce and Navy mercilessly killed many American sailors.If you are an American patriot you can not stand by and let this foreign power use us for their evil goals.Jerrod Kushner is a traitor and he is setting us up for conflict with every country around Israel. Iraq, Libya, Iran, Syria must be destroyed and they used ISIS and American to do it. ISIS has attacked Christians and MUSLIMS; but never Israel and no one seems to think something is strange about this \textbf{terrorist} organization never throwing even one pebble at Israel but swear war on everyone else.If you are a Christian please realize they use your love of Jesus to manipulate American politics.Also realize Jesus was not the Messiah name and the bible clearly predicted this great identity theft.

Nor is it the representative for Jewish people world wide. Many Jewish peoples throughout the world oppose Zionism. Many of them from very religious Jewish communities.

The right course has become clear from the wrong." (\textbf{Quran} 2:256)'And let not the enmity and hatred of others make you avoid justice. Be just: that is nearer to piety' (\textbf{Quran} 5: 8)"If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which is as thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers.....thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him: But thou shalt surely KILL HIM; thine hand shall be first upon him to put him TO DEATH, and afterwards the hand of all the people." (Deuteronomy 13:6-9)Well Narendra,There is no comparison whatsoever between what this world has seen the 'non-Muslims' do and what the Muslims have done. The two World Wars in which 70 million people were killed were 'Christian' wars.Then there is the occupation of Muslim lands and the exploitation of their resources, which was and still is happening at the hands of 'non-Muslims' of all religions. This should be borne in mind when speaking of the Islamic view of humanity and of love and compassion. Fair-minded historians should compare the Islamic conquests of other lands with the Crusades, for example, and what happened in each case.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Yeah - truthful to each other meaning fellow muslims - not to non-believers who are considered free game ! Islam will not or cannot coexists with people of other religions or faiths. Look at the religious minorities in muslim majority countries - they are or have been systematically wiped out to almost nonexistence. Hindu India is facing a growing threat from its own muslims . Google for yourselves the percentage of muslims in India after the partitioning in 1947 and today. In a few more generations, muslims will form almost 50  or more of the population of India. More than Pakistan and Bangladesh combined ! China has the foresight to see the dangers posed by Islam in  the country and has taken proactive steps to protect herself from this - I prefer to use the term - VIRUS ! The Christian West is still \textbf{deaf}, \textbf{dumb} and \textbf{blind} to the dangers posed by islam. Really need to wake up before it is too late to do anything about it.

Then We sent to her Our Angel, and he represented himself to her as a well-proportioned man.19:18She said, "Indeed, I seek refuge in the Most Merciful from you, [so leave me], if you should be fearing of Allah ."19:19 He said, "I am only the messenger of your Lord to give you [news of] a pure boy."19:20She said, "How can I have a boy while no man has touched me and I have not been unchaste?"19:21 He said, "Thus [it will be]; your Lord says, 'It is easy for Me, and We will make him a sign to the people and a mercy from Us. And it is a matter [already] decreed.' "19:22 So she conceived him, and she withdrew with him to a remote place.19:23 And the pains of childbirth drove her to the trunk of a palm tree. She said, "Oh, I wish I had died before this and was in oblivion, forgotten."19:24But he called her from below her, "Do not grieve; your Lord has provided beneath you a stream.19:25 And shake toward you the trunk of the palm tree; it will drop upon you ripe, fresh dates.19:26So eat and drink and be contented. And if you see from among humanity anyone, say, 'Indeed, I have vowed to the Most Merciful abstention, so I will not speak today to [any] man.' "19:27Then she brought him to her people, carrying him. They said, "O Mary, you have certainly done a thing unprecedented.19:28O sister of Aaron, your father was not a man of evil, nor was your mother unchaste."19:29So she pointed to him. They said, "How can we speak to one who is in the cradle a child?"19:30[Jesus] said, "Indeed, I am the servant of Allah . He has given me the Scripture and made me a prophet.19:31And He has made me blessed wherever I am and has enjoined upon me prayer and zakah as long as I remain alive19:32And [made me] dutiful to my mother, and He has not made me a wretched tyrant.19:33And peace is on me the day I was born and the day I will die and the day I am raised alive."19:34That is Jesus, the son of Mary - the word of truth about which they are in dispute.19:35It is not [befitting] for Allah to take a son; exalted is He! When He decrees an affair, He only says to it, "Be," and it is.19:36[Jesus said], "And indeed, Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him.

How can you believe a Muslim who states she is for Jews when the writings of Islam state that Jews come from apes and they are as Christians are which the \textbf{Quran} calls 'pigs and dogs."

Sarsour even has to dictate to the 'white women' a special message because 'white people' are to be dummied down to be part of that crusade to make America bow to Sharia and Islam's dictates.All of these candidates including Ocasio are there in Congress to bend the laws so that these radicals  can make way for their own cult's  agendas so they are paving the way for those hostile agendas under the guise of helping women, illegals, blacks etc.  People (even celebrities like Allyssa Milano) are being used to be part and parcel to this group but underneath it all the goal is to destroy the U.S. from within and make it bow to Islam's agendas and the leftist \textbf{communist} group aka Sanders group, and the \textbf{black} activists, the illegals, and the women's groups have united with Sarsour's Power group (and remember that is CAIR in disguise) to vote for these Muslim candidates and \textbf{black} activist candidates that have leaned to this power group. Ultimately they are using each other to get a greater voice for each need each other to be a greater voice  but buyer beware the \textbf{common} goal is to divide the \textbf{Nation} and let it fall to hostile agendas. Do see Laura Loomer (a Jewish journalist) approach this problem and she shows that in Minnesota the Somalian refugees are taking the monies to push for their own (Keith Ellison also) so they can use the State funds to help ONLY the Somalians. She confronts Omar, Sarsour, Milano, etc.  In one video  the American Indians are shown living in tents  and cannot get Section 8 Housing or aid because all the money goes to the elite Muslim Somalian refugees.  Same as in Dearborn Michigan with the no go Sharia zones.

So those  women activists who were non Muslim who sided with a \textbf{woman} who is anti Israel, who favors  an ideology that sponsors genital mutilation and that calls death for anyone who does not adhere to Islam, do note you are being used and lied to. This is the silent Jihad being prepared for the U.S. till they become the greater number to gain power here and there are people willing to help them achieve it. So this lying techinque to the Jews was to get the vote and precede with the agenda they tote so the people believed Omar were ignorant and given over to this notion that political correctness is the way to go but it is not a two way street in Islam.This is Omar's associate and sponsor and any \textbf{woman} to vote for a cult that fosters this type of ideology should be ashamed of themselves and that goes for the celebs like Milano, Amy Schumer, Cynthia Nixon and the rest.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Common, Communist, Nation, Quran, Race, Terrorist, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General, Nationality - General, Religious Identity - Muslim, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}11/680 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.618 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Halley Jalal al Din al-Suyuti narrates Ibn Abbas, the MOST REVERED and TRUSTED narrator of tradition in the sight of the SUNNIS regarding his opinion of Al- taqiyya in the \textbf{Quran} verse: Ali Imran 3:28 "but not the Believers take for friends or helpers, unbelievers, rather than Believers if any do that in \textbf{nothing} will there be help from Allah; except by  way of precaution that ye may guard yourselves from them. But Allah cautions you (to remember) himself for the final goal is to Allah. That Ibn Abbas said "Al Taqiyya is with the tongue only; he who has been coerced into saying that which angers Allah and his heart is comfortable( I.e.  his true faith has not been shaken.) then (saying that which he has been coerced to say) will not harm him (at all); (because) al taqiyya is with the tongue only (not the heart.)" (Book "al Durr al Manthoor Fi al Tafsir al Ma'athoor")Abu Bakr al Razi states " It is permissible to speak words of unbelief when Al taqiyya is mandatory."  Ahkam al \textbf{Quran}" v2, p 10)Ibn Abbas stated "al Takia is the uttering of the tongue, while the heart is comfortable with faith which means that the tongue is permitted to other any untruth in a time of need as long as the heart is not affected and one is still a believer."  When the followers of Muhammad are in a weak position they are allowed to lie and do whatever is expedient to survive even if it meant breaking every Prohibition in the \textbf{Quran}. Taqiyya allows mohammedans to become short or long-term sleepers to be able to use deception, misinformation, disinformation, to bring discord and anything else to collapse the kuffar until Islam is dominant and the kufr is subjugated. So little Sunni you are a liar!!!!!! And you just proved it. You know what is so funny is that the person that you're talking to could be an ex-muslim, could be a minority who's actually had to live under the oppression of Muslims, or could be somebody who has just spent the time to educate herself and not take it for the words of the media, SJW marxist propaganda and Muslim propaganda.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nothing, Quran & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Religious Identity - Muslim & \cellcolor{green!27}4/372 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.075 \\  \hline

That there are over 35,000 uses Qatl with its derivatives used against, justifying killing unbelievers. This has been carried out for 1400 years \& still going. Mohammedans slew 80 million Hindus just because they were kufr. 8 million Armenians, just because they were kufr, millions of Christians, just because they were kufr, millions of Jews, just because they were kufr, killed many of atheist scientists in the early onset of Islam, just because they were kufr.

A Muslim has to follow the laws of the land their in.There is a back ground to this. But of course you did not provide it.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small American's are asleep at the wheel:   Lets look at the \textbf{Quran}, instead of getting our information from Soundbytes and propaganda clips.   SURA 3:28:  Let not the believers take the unbelievers for protectors rather than believers; and whoever does this, he shall have \textbf{nothing} of (the guardianship of) Allah, but you should guard yourselves against them, guarding carefully ( ÿ™ŸÇ€åÿ©‚Äé taqiyyah/taqƒ´yah). Talk to any Imam and they will freely tell you this...  if they do not lie.  I talked to one in the Capital City of Indonesia and he was extremely open and friendly with me.  He had \textbf{nothing} to hide.  He told me this:  Muslims are permitted to lie: (1) to save their lives, (2) to reconcile a husband and wife, (3) to persuade a \textbf{woman} into a bedroom and (4) to facilitate one on his journey. Muslims are even permitted to disavow Islam and Mohammed if it is not a genuine heart-felt rejection. Muslims will tell you that concealment of a truth is not an abandonment of that truth if it benefits Islam.  So, basically you can lie if you can justify that it serves Mohammad, and the ultimate goal of Islam, in making the entire world subservient to their religion, or they will kill you.  Yes, it is radical...and Yes, they firmly believe in it with their entire being.... and Yes, Americans, Europe, and the West cannot fit that into their Ideological motif of "Lets just be all inclusive and get along" mentality.  They just can't think someone could be so "intolerant."   It is like saying a wolf wouldn't dare hurt the sheep,  because it acts very similar to the sheepdog, and even looks like the sheepdog.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Really?  Neo-Nazis are not conservatives?  I seem to remember white nationalist Richard Spencer leading a rally after Trump's election where he led the audience in chants of "Hail Trump," accompanied by fascist salutes.  Watch it here if you haven't seen it: [LINK] I also seem to remember Spencer organizing the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville (Unite the RIGHT, not the left), the one Trump couldn't quite bring himself to fully condemn.  You know, the one where the conservatives marched through the streets carrying torches and chanting \textbf{Nazi} slogans such as "Blood and soil!" and "Jews will not replace us."  I remember James Allsup, president of the WSU chapter of College Republicans, was there and he posted a video where he almost jizzed his pants when he ran into Richard Spencer, "Mr. Spencer sir, how can I help you sir, can I direct traffic for you sir."  It was humiliating, and put to rest the lie that Republicans and neo-Nazis aren't joined at the hip.  I also remember Allsup in the video speaking highly of KKK grand wizard David Duke, who was also at the Unite the Right rally.  So, both neo-Nazis and the KKK were at the pro-Trump Unite the Right rally.  What does that tell you?By the way, do you know about the Enabling Act of 1933?  It was the piece of legislation that gave Hitler dictatorial powers.  The Nazis did not have enough votes in the parliament to pass it on their own, so needed help from other parties.  There were four other major parties in parliament at the time: DNVP (conservative nationalists), Zentrum (conservative Catholics), SPD (socialists), and KPD (communists).  The two conservative parties voted UNANIMOUSLY in favor of the legislation, thus making Hitler dictator.  The SPD voted UNANIMOUSLY against the legislation.  The KPD would have voted against it, but all its members were under arrest or in hiding.

That is a matter of documented history.  You presented no rebuttal aside from vague assertions.  Then, just as now, Nazis align with the right.  The Unite the Right Rally in Charlottesville was sponsored by and/or attended by neo-Nazis and the KKK.  At the rally, they declared their support for Trump.Really, all you're basing it on is the word "socialist" in the \textbf{Nazi} name.  If you knew history, you would know that the more socialist elements in the \textbf{Nazi} party (notably Ernst Rohm and the SA) were decisively purged during the Night of the Long Knives in 1934.  This purge came at the urging of conservatives within and outside the \textbf{Nazi} party.  Once it was over, conservatives were firmly in power.  The Nazis had a friendly relationship with business, were anti-communist, against independent unions, aggressively privatized industries that had been nationalized in previous administrations (banks, railways, steel, shipbuilding, utilities, etc.).  No socialist government would undertake aggressive privatization.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small You stupid brainwashed fool.How can you call her anti-Semitic? She is likely more Semitic than Netenyahu. The bible says the devil will deceive the world. First of all Semitic is not a group of people it is a family of languages indigenous to Africa. Aramaic, Arabic, Hebrew, Amharic, Tegri, and about 400 others spoken Africa.The Zionists rule our country and have infiltrated the Christian Church. Any bible scholar knows the Jews are descendants from the European Kazarian Kingdom. In 740 AD they converted to Judaism under King Bulan. For hundreds of years they ruled a region between the Caspian and \textbf{Black} Sea. They converted to Judaism the same way Donald Trump's daughter did. These imposters have no genetic, historical, or archeological connections to the Biblical Hebrews. The Christian church remains silent because if these European imposters are exposed; then people will ask who and where are the Hebrew Israelites.First of all they would look like Rep. Omar. The biblical Hebrews were Negros. Israel is in Africa despite attempts to redefine it as the middle east. Moses was raised as Pharaohs Grandson and all the Pharaoh's of that era were Negros. Pharaoh had order the murder of all Hebrew baby boys of Moses \textbf{age}. Their was no physical differences between Hebrews, Egyptian, and Ethiopian people. When Moses true identity was discovered he fled into the wilderness. While resting at the well he helped the Shepard girls water their flock. When they return home early their father ask them, " how is it you are back home so soon". They answered an Egyptian helped us. They thought he was Egyptian because Moses fled with the clothes on his back. He was still wearing Egyptian clothes. Moses married an Ethiopian \textbf{woman}. King Salomon and Sheba first born son Maliki became the first King of Ethiopia. European were desperate to white wash history. For this lie to work they had to make the Egyptians and the Israelites white. This served the Kazarian European Jews and the Christian church. In many European countries that were not invested in the exploitation of Africa and it's people; you find \textbf{Black} Madonna and Messiah.The Catholic Church decided to change the image of the Messiah. Pope Alexander VI commission a new European image of the Messiah. It was a big deal so a heated competition between DaVinci and Michelangelo ended with DaVinci winning the contract because he was rumored to be the lover of the Pope's son Cesare Borgia. The image of the Christ that is on a billion pictures is the \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} son of Pope Alexander. Why would the Hebrew people ever go to Europe. When threatened they always fled to Egypt and when Jerusalem was destroyed by the Romans they fled in to south and west Africa where you can find the tribes today. These Africans pass the Genetic test and they still follow Hebrew traditions. The very first maps of Africa commissioned by European Kings shows a section of West Africa called the Kingdom of Judah. Now this is where the story gets interesting. When the slave trade started we are told other \textbf{African} sold other \textbf{African} tribes into slavery. The truth that will shatter all we know today is the first slaves brought to the Western Hemisphere were the tribe of Judah. Yes, the hated blacks of the America's are directly decendant of the tribe of Judah.The imposter Netenyahu stood before Congress claming Moses led his people, but Moses never went to Poland. Netenyahu whose real name was Millenkosky before his father changed it to sound Hebrew.Some say they are our allies. I need only point out how they have spied on us for decades and then sold those secrets to our strategic enemies. Russia received the bulk of these secrets in exchange for allowing more Jews to immigrate to Israel.During the Iraq war they were caught trying to steal secrets about our troop placements in Iraq. Intending to assist insurgents kill American troops. Even more dramatic was the 1967 attack on the USS LIBERTY. They made every attempt to sink this ship and blame it on the Egyptians during the Arab Israeli war. The ship was clearly American and many sailors lost their lives as the Israeli Airforce and Navy mercilessly killed many American sailors.If you are an American patriot you can not stand by and let this foreign power use us for their evil goals.Jerrod Kushner is a traitor and he is setting us up for conflict with every country around Israel. Iraq, Libya, Iran, Syria must be destroyed and they used ISIS and American to do it. ISIS has attacked Christians and MUSLIMS; but never Israel and no one seems to think something is strange about this \textbf{terrorist} organization never throwing even one pebble at Israel but swear war on everyone else.If you are a Christian please realize they use your love of Jesus to manipulate American politics.Also realize Jesus was not the Messiah name and the bible clearly predicted this great identity theft. Revelations 2:9 and 3:9 clearly calls these people as the synagogue of Satan.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African, Age, Black, Gay, Terrorist, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Ethnicity - Black, Gender - General, Religious Identity - Muslim, Sexual Identity - General, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality & \cellcolor{green!5}9/856 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.051 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Yisroel Katz That seems kind of absurd. Mandatory Palestine existed as part of the British Empire for almost like half a century, and was occupied by the Ottomans for 100s of years before that. Arabs have been living on that land for nearly as long as Jews have. Intriguingly, a cursory glance at Wikipedia also suggests that the region was majority Christian for a long time before the turn of the 19th century. I don't think anyone should question the right of Israel to exist, since they won it fair and square, but that doesn't mean that you have to demonize the other side either.I think you should consider this. Dershowitz is being pretty disingenuous when he talks about the "anti-Semitism of the hard right". Obviously, that exists, but it's also a massive oversimplification in many cases. Based on your other comments on the vid, you seem to realize that Democrats aren't truly the friends of the Jews. From my reading of history, I don't think that the Jew has ever known a better friend than the white American evangelical Christian, at least in this current era. However, white gentiles are also starting to feel taken advantage of, since as you probably know, the majority of Jews lean liberal, liberals have taken an anti-white turn, and therefore many of those highly visible anti-white liberals are Jews. So, that is where that rise in anti-Semitism, which is real, is coming from. What I would submit to you is that you shouldn't dichotimize us into categories of "Zionist Christians" or whatever and the rest as "neo-Nazis". Instead, think of it like we want to renegotiate our relationship with the Jews, and try to approach us willing to have that conversation and with understanding as long we're not being overly hostile towards you. That "special relationship" between the white gentile and the Jew, whatever has worked for 70 years, obviously isn't working out so well right now. Non-Jewish whites are starting to feel taken advantage of, and that's only human. At the same time, Jews and white Christians together over the last century have built, bar none, the greatest civilization that the world has ever seen, which is why the rest of the world also wants a piece of that pie too. It would be a shame if we had to lose all that. I understand that you seem to be very proud of your people, your culture, and are probably sensitive to any threats to that. Which is an admirable trait. However, there are lots of Jews out there who are willing to make the difficult step of reaching out to us and having those tough conversations, so I just wanted to put it in your head that there are people like me out there and we're not all monsters. Fox News is not all-encompassing of all the conversations happening on the right right now. The powers that be, the ruling class, whomever they may be, divide us into arbitrary categories of Jew, gentile, Christian and atheist and Muslim, white and \textbf{black}, man and \textbf{woman}, straight and \textbf{g\textbf{ay}}, etc., and then sell us a poison pill "diversity" as a solution to all those problems, but the reality is if we're going to unite and beat those people, it will still involve building bridges of our own as well.Sorry for the rant, but I hope I don't come across as a hateful person, I disagree with some of the rhetoric of very "anti-Palestian" Israel supporters but I also admire your passion. :) I would feel much safer with people like you on my side than not if shit ever hits the fan.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Gay, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Gender - General, Sexual Identity - General, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality & \cellcolor{green!5}4/611 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.655 \\  \hline

Arabs favored Germany over other European powers, because "Germany was seen as having no direct colonial or territorial ambitions in the area. This was an important point of sympathy", Wild wrote.[1] They also saw German nationhood‚Äîwhich preceded German statehood‚Äîas a model for their own movement.In October 1938, anti-Jewish treatises that included extracts from Mein Kampf were disseminated at an Islamic parliamentarians' conference "for the defense of Palestine" in Cairo.[11][1][12]\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nationalism & \cellcolor{green!27}Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/137 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.73 \\  \hline

Johnson told Kennedy aide Ted Sorensen that "I know the risks are great and we might lose the South, but those sorts of states may be lost anyway."Senator Richard Russell, Jr. later warned President Johnson that his strong support for the civil rights bill "will not only cost you the South, it will cost you the election".

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Daniel Vincent what books should we read. Debunk each one of these facts then.Reasons to never trust DEMOCRATS: Democrats fought to expand slavery while Republicans fought to end it. Democrats passed those discriminatory \textbf{Black} Codes and \textbf{Jim C\textbf{row}} laws. Democrats supported and passed the Missouri Compromise to protect slavery. Democrats supported and passed the Kansas Nebraska Act to expand slavery. Democrats supported and backed the Dred Scott Decision. Democrats opposed educating blacks and murdered our teachers. Democrats fought against anti-lynching laws. Democrats passed the Repeal Act of 1894 that overturned civil right laws enacted by Republicans. Democrats declared that they would rather vote for a "\textbf{y\textbf{e\textbf{llow}}} dog" than vote for a Republican, because the Republican Party was known as "the party of nig--rs." Democrat Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia is well known for having been a "Kleagle" and a recruiter in the Ku Klux Klan. He personally filibustered the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for 14 straight hours to keep it from passage. Democrat Senators Sam Ervin and Albert Gore, Sr. (the father of former Vice President Al Gore) joined him in his efforts to defeat the bill. Democrat President Woodrow Wilson, reintroduced segregation throughout the federal government immediately upon taking office in 1913. Democrat President Franklin D. Roosevelt's first appointment to the Supreme Court was a life-long member of the Ku Klux Klan, Sen. Hugo \textbf{Black}, (D-AL). Roosevelt's choice for vice president in 1944 was Harry Truman, who was a member of the Kansas City chapter of the Ku Klux Klan in 1922. Roosevelt resisted Republican efforts to pass a federal law against lynching and opposed integration of the armed forces. Democrats supported and backed Judge John Ferguson in the case of Plessy v Ferguson. Democrats supported the School Board of Topeka Kansas in the case of Brown v The Board of Education of Topeka Kansas. Democrat public safety commissioner Eugene "Bull" Connor, in Birmingham, AL unleashed vicious dogs and turned fire hoses on \textbf{black} civil rights demonstrators. Democrats were who Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and the other protesters were fighting. Democrat Georgia Governor Lester Maddox (1967-1971) "brandished" an ax hammer to prevent blacks from patronizing his restaurant. Democrat Governor George Wallace blocked the entrance to an Alabama schoolhouse in 1963. He blocked the doors with his body, declaring that Alabama would be segregated forever. Democrat Arkansas Governor Orval Faubus (1955-1967) fought to keep Little Rock public schools segregated. Democrat Senator John F. Kennedy voted against the 1957 Civil rights Act. As President, Kennedy opposed the 1963 March on Washington by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. He also had Dr. King wiretapped and investigated by the FBI. Democrat President Bill Clinton's mentor was U.S. Senator J. William Fulbright, an Arkansas Democrat and a supporter of racial segregation. Clinton served as an intern for Fulbright in 1966-67. Sen. Fulbright signed the Southern Manifesto opposing the Supreme Court's 1954 Brown vs. Board of Education decision. He joined with the Dixiecrats in filibustering the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1964 and also voted against the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Southern Democrats opposed desegregation and integration. The Democrat National Party's 1868 slogan was, "It's a white man's party, let white men rule." Democrat Progressive Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood, was a white supremacist and attended Ku Klux Klan rallies in order to garner political and financial support. Sanger stated that Planned Parenthood was established in order to control the population of those whom she deemed "Inferior Races" (Negros, Jews, Latinos, etc.). Sanger was also a \textbf{Nazi} sympathizer and a believer in \textbf{Eugenics}. Democrats opposed: The Emancipation Proclamation The 13th Amendment The 14th Amendment The 15th Amendment The Reconstruction Act of 1867 The Civil Rights of 1866 The Enforcement Act of 1870 The Forced Act of 1871 The Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 The Civil Rights Act of 1875 The Freeman Bureau The Civil Rights Act of 1957 The Civil Rights Act of 1960 The Civil Rights Act of 1964 The Voting Rights Act of 1965 The United State Civil Rights Commission Republicans gave strong bi-partisan support and sponsorship for the following legislation: The Civil Rights Act of 1964 The Voting Rights Act of 1965 The 1968 Civil Rights Acts The Equal Opportunity Act of 1972 Goals and Timetables for Affirmative Action Programs Comprehensive Employment Training Act of 1973 Voting Rights Act of Amendment of 1982 Civil Rights Act of 1983 Federal Contract Compliance and Workforce Development Act of 1988 The Republicans: Republicans enacted civil rights laws in the 1950's and 1960's, over the objection of Democrats. Republicans founded the HBCU's (Historical \textbf{Black} Colleges and Universities) and started the NAACP to counter the \textbf{racist} practices of the Democrats. Republicans pushed through much of the ground-breaking civil rights legislation in Congress. Republicans fought slavery and amended the Constitution to grant blacks freedom, citizenship and the right to vote. Republicans pushed through much of the groundbreaking civil rights legislation from the 1860s through the 1960s. Republican President Dwight Eisenhower sent troops into the South to desegregate the schools. Republican President Eisenhower appointed Chief Justice Earl Warren to the Supreme Court, which resulted in the 1954 Brown vs. Board of Education decision. Republican Senator Everett Dirksen from Illinois, not Democrat President Lyndon Johnson, was the one who pushed through the civil rights laws of the 1960's. Republican Senator Everett Dirksen from Illinois wrote the language for the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Republican Senator Everett Dirksen from Illinois also crafted the language for the Civil Rights Act of 1968 which prohibited discrimination in housing. Republican and \textbf{black} American, A. Phillip Randolph, organized the 1963 March by Dr. King on Washington. The Ku Klux Klan was established after Southern Democrats lost the Civil War to the Republican Party. They were thought of as the "militant arm" of the Democrat Party and sought to kill former \textbf{Black} slaves, Irish slaves, \textbf{O\textbf{r\textbf{iental}}} Slaves \& the Republicans who freed them all. The late Senator Robert Byrd (D-W VA) recruited for the KKK. The Democratic Party gave us the Ku Klux Klan, \textbf{Black} Codes, \textbf{Jim C\textbf{row}} Laws and other repressive legislation which resulted in the multitude of murders, lynching, mutilations, and intimidations (of thousands of \textbf{black} and white Republicans). On the issue of slavery: historians say the Democrats gave their lives to expand it, the Republicans gave their lives to ban it. "--The KKK was the \textbf{terrorist} wing of the Democrat Party.--" The 1964 Civil Rights Act Roll Call Vote: In the House, only 64 percent of the Democrats (153 yes, 91 no), but 80 percent of the Republicans (136 yes, 35 no), voted for it. In the Senate, while only 68 percent of the Democrats endorsed the bill (46 yes, 21 no), 82 percent of the Republicans voted to enact it (27 yes, 6 no). Thaddeus Stevens, a Radical Republican that introduced legislation to give \textbf{African} Americans the so-called 40 acres and a mule and Democrats overwhelmingly voted against the bill. During the Senate debates on the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, it was revealed that members of the Democratic Party formed many \textbf{terrorist} organizations like the Ku Klux Klan to murder and intimidate \textbf{African} Americans voters. The Ku Klux Klan Act was a bill introduced by a Republican Congress to stop Klan Activities. History reveals that Democrats lynched, burned, mutilated and murdered thousands of blacks and completely destroyed entire towns and communities occupied by middle class Blacks, including Rosewood, Florida, the Greenwood District in Tulsa Oklahoma, and Wilmington, North Carolina to name a few. History reveals that it was Abolitionists and Radical Republicans such as Henry L. Morehouse and General Oliver Howard that started many of the traditional \textbf{Black} colleges, while Democrats fought to keep them closed. Many of our traditional \textbf{Black} colleges are named after white Republicans.

A few years ago antifa was demanding the sheriff offices in my state to release records on people with CCW permits so these people could be targeted, for what reason we still don't know. We have seen an up swing in anti-Semitic behavior. This also coincides with Obama bring in large numbers of Muslims. These Muslims are not choosing the Republican Party. Antifa, a democratic supposed organization, os constantly trying to violate freedom of speech. This is happening today. An other reason for a history lesson it because every single person of color tries to use it to justify their \textbf{racist} mentality, but when it is used to reflect habitual of a political party snowflakes have meltdowns. So make up your mind are we going to have a history discussion or not? Now you know why Obama tried hard to rewrite history, because Democrats was on the wrong side.

The left supports Farrakhan, who is a rabid anti Semite.  He was a rabid anti Semite.  The left hates Trump, he hates Trump.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Correct! I might want to point out though that this is in terms of the full number of dead, not the frequency of attacks.  Remember, the only reason for that particular number of Right Wing attacks to be so high, is due to the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. It's the second deadliest \textbf{terrorist} attack in U.S. history, killed 168 people and accounted for 77 of all the murders committed by Nationalist and Right Wing terrorists since 1992! There generally aren't a lot of politically motivated attacks in the US and that makes this a pretty crude statistic as it is difficult to measure. Daniel Vincent Mentioned earlier that he had no interest for left wing attacks or KKK attacks that happened decades ago, therefor it wouldn't be fair to put focus on Nationalist and Right Wing terrorists attacks that happened almost 30 years ago either! If one where to look at it from a broader perspective and go further back in time to Southern Democrats and Ku Klux Klan attacks, the result would look different. If one where to put all politically motivated attacks together from the last centuries and compare Left and Right Wing motivated attacks, there probably would not be a huge difference anyway, and most people on both the left and the right would denounce all these attacks despite which ideology inspired them anyway. I just brought this up as there seemingly was an interest for the most recent politically motivated attacks.

Also, even if that was true, were made anonymously so, there is not way that Hillary or \textbf{nobody} could know about that. Also the endorsement to Obama was because the KKK preferred to endorse Obama than Hillary. David Duke, personally has said that he never will endorse her, he prefers a \textbf{black} president than her. Look, again, KKK members think that their \textbf{race} is superior to other races, they are against immigration and advocates of the 2nd amendment .

The streets are full of \textbf{old} needles and human waist. I never used to generalize between parties but that is what we have come down to. If someone even suspects that you my have voted for Trump you are instantly labeled a \textbf{racist} or a \textbf{Nazi} or what ever else a college kid can dream up. I can tell all you finger pointing liberals that you don't know what a real \textbf{racist} is. The Democrats think they are accomplishing something by instructing these Antifa kids to harass people. Trying to push socialism and crying about free speech. These stupid democratic college kids don't remember the cold war and when they can't truly support socialism the chant and protest. As far as voting single party I watched Democrats do that my entire life. They voted by what their preachers and union leaders told them to. To over turn the damage that was caused alot of people not just me is voting straight republican. So far it is working. But when one political party has controlled a state or a city for an extended period of time you can't blame the other party for anything. When I look at gang ridden areas filled with drug addicts I look at who is running the show. Guess who it usually is?  I didn't vote for Trump because I thought he was a loud loudmouth asshole. After I have been attacked too many times in one way or an other by want to be Antifa, social justice warriors, and even a drugged up \textbf{crazy} \textbf{lesbian} in the work place I'm fed up with this childish shit. The left has gone too far left for any sane, hard working, middle of the road person to even understand. When some nut case does something to hurt other people you damn liberals start screaming about how violent and dangerous republican white males are, and screaming Trumptards, the Democrats are going to save us all with socialism, legalizing drugs of all kinds because addiction is a disease. Ban all the guns so only the gangs will have them. All the conservatives I know are not robing people so they can shoot up. They have CCW permits and follow ever gun law on the books. They are small businesses owners and others work hard at their careers. If I have to swing in one direction it will be to the right.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small You have made a lot of points. Try to do only a few and so we can debate easily. I don't understand why you talk about drugs problem and homeless. The drug problem is the crime derived from making it illegal. Legalize drugs is not a good solution, but at least is not that bad as making it illegal. That was problem when \textbf{alcohol}  was illegal in the 1920s.Again, I'm not a leftist , but about Trump , well, that guy is literally a \textbf{racist}, liar that doesn't care if he lies, because he will lie about the lie that he said. Someone that praises dictators like Putin, the guy from north korea, the one from China etc. By any stretch  of the imagination Trump is person that respects the fundamental values of the Constitution about freedom , separation of power in government etc. He thinks that people should obey him I rig the game for it. Seriously, Trump, for me is at the bottom of the bottom. But if someone supports him , I'll like to know why. If they said, Trump after Hillary, ok, I maybe can understand that, but otherwise it doesn't make any sense for me.The point about the drugs addict and who is running it, I don't agree. Alabama and some of the states in the south are the poorest in the country. Those states are run almost by republicans. If fact, if you  can say something is that the richest cities in the country are all left. New York, San Francisco, Seattle etc. Sure, you can say the same for poorest places, but I will debate that a little more. I agree fully with you about Antifa and other groups, but those people are very far to the left. The middle of the republican party is to far to the right. And , I don't know if you have notice this, but the whole world, is moving to the left, academy, industries etc, and the american right is way , way far to the right.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Racist, alcohol & \cellcolor{green!5}Behavioural Addiction - Alcohol, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/343 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.583 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small rey well to start with the real reason the left has gone nuts. Trump. The crooked Clinton's screwed over Bernie, but that is OK because Bernie is a full blown Socialist. We can't have socialism in the US because it never worked in the past it will never work in the future. Socialized medicine is a different story. That works great in all the other industrialized nations. Hillary lost because of two reasons. First no one wanted an other Clinton in office then she threatened to destroy fossil fuels. With \textbf{nothing} to replace it with. When she said that she lost Ohio and Pennsylvania. She cut her own throat. You can't blame Trump for being in the right place at the right time. With the combination of the east sitting on the largest reserve of natural gas ever discovered. Republicans loosening the restrictions on the industry and the introduction of right to work laws. If you have not noticed, anyone that wants a job can have a good one. Trump's and republicans policies have created over 4 million jobs in a year and a half. For the first time in West Virginia sense WWII there are more jobs than sober people to fill them. Sense Trump has become president my income has more than doubled, real companies have came into my state because of right to work laws and I have the best health insurance I have ever had. Because I have seen this happen first hand I will vote for Trump in 2020. Right now I know of a dozen companies and plants beginning for drug free employees with pay and benefits to reflect that need. Democrats and unions could not do this in my life time. As far as legalizing drugs. For starters weed is not a drug it is an herbal supplement. Like mushrooms. I think people should be able to grow it like tomatoes and green beans. If people have open access to heroin they would be dying in the parking lots. We have a bad heroin problem and non junkies are not getting ambulance and first responder help that they need because they are all being use for overdoses. Can you imagine if you could walk into a store and buy LSD? I know alot about drugs, I have done my share of partying and I know people are to stupid to do drugs. In the tristate area where I live drugs are a small part of gang activity. Human trafficking is big. If you legalize all natural drugs that is great, weed is better for everyone than beer is. However you would have to crack down hard on the use, distribution and manufacturing of hard drugs. Get off the idea that addiction is a disease. You can't have people buying meth at the flea market. As far as guns go, let's start enforcing the laws already on the books. You can require people to take classes and qualification tests only if they are going to carry. You can't do it for ownership. Once you do that the government can change one little thing in the requirements and then violate the second amendment. I think making it 21 to but any firearm is a very good idea. All school shootings in the past 25 years have been done by kids under the \textbf{age} of 21. Kids are just not as responsible as they used to be. States need to update certain laws. The school shooting in Florida by a 20 year \textbf{old} formal student. He had 30 or so domestic violence calls from his mom. In WV you have one call you loose your right to own a gun. You can pass laws to restrict law biding people from owning, using and carrying fire arms. Although I don't support the idea, cities should have different gun laws than non over populated areas. But to get back to Trump. I have not seen anything that tells me he is a \textbf{racist}. I am going off of what I know a \textbf{racist} to be. Not the sheltered, politically correct, liberal arts degree definition. You see in WV for example the grand dragon of the KKK would be drug behind a puck up truck for the simple fact that only fags wear purple. So you can't call people \textbf{racist} if you don't even know what it is. I have followed politics sense Carter was president. I have never seen a politician that doesn't lie.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Dude, don't make paragraphs that long, also include line breaks :), it's more easy to read.It seems that we more or less agree on guns and drugs, so I won't talk about that.Let me start with the fact that Trump and republicans have created a lot of jobs. That statement is misleading. The average number of jobs per month created under Trump is lower than during Obama. In fact, Trump hasn't done anything , since 2010 all the numbers(jobs, unemployment, etc) in the economy have been improving. What Trump does is the same that always have done, take credit for things that he didn't accomplish. And also I will go a little further to tell you that even Obama wasn't the direct responsible for the state of the economy. In fact, we can attribute that to Yanet Allen , that was the head of the Federal Reserve during all of these years and was the one who implemented a excellent monetary policy. So, even if Hillary was the president or McCain or Bernie, the economy will stay more or less the same. The best job that a president can do for the economy is to not intervene. Also, you are not talking about the tariff that Trump have made that are costing billions to the economy and tax payers, because of his protectionist mentality. It's true that all politician lies. We do to. Almost everyone care about the truth, they will hide that lie, or try to deny it, because they care about what you think. But Trump and his people, they don't care about , they will lie, constantly, they will make fact in the air, they would lie directly to your face about the lie that they said. Look, suppose that you have a couple and that person is cheating on you. The normal thing is that they will deny it, because at some level the "respect" you. So, they will try no to do it again or be more careful. That is what a regular politician does. But now, suppose that the person cheated on you in front of your face. So you confront her and \textbf{nothing} happens. Again they will do it in your face, because they don't care about you opinion. And this is what Trump and his people does. And in my opinion, this is very dangerous, because for them there is no difference between true and lies. Also, look at what he does as president. He only goes to Fox News, because they trait him polite. How many interviews have had Trump with CNN, New York times etc. That is very wrong, he his doing the same that dictators do, and it's be interviewed by people that support you. Look at Obama, Bush, Clinton, Reagan, etc, all of them have done several interviews with people of the opposite side, and have defended their points of view. If you think that that is not dangerous  i think that you don't understand how easy is to brake democracy and the american idea of freedom.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}1/511 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.196 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I just want to make another point. You said that socialism was try it and was a failure. I think that you are talking about Soviet Union, Cuba, North Korea etc. By any stretch of the imagination, Bernie is a "\textbf{communist}", in fact he will be someone in the middle of the political spectrum in a country like Sweden or Australia etc. And those countries are more "capitalistic" than US, look at the index of economic freedom. Bernie just want a safety network for people on the bottom, that is.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small rey I know the president doesn't have as much to do with the economy as people think. However republicans support right to work laws and Democrats don't. I am living a middle class life now because of right to work laws. Trump is not my first choice as a president, I didn't even vote for him however he is all we had. Sure I wish I could resurrect Ross Perot. To tell me Trp is a \textbf{racist} you have to give me an example, because O don't see it. The media is just so bias they just attack. Trump is not going to be a dictator because you can only have two terms. The only reason Trump is on office is because there is no one else to vote for.     There is a veteran from the southern coal fields of West Virginia, he is a democrat he ran for something and lost. I don't know what because I live on the North and didn't care. He claims he is going to run for the presidency. Maybe just maybe someone will be worth voting for in 2020. Until then I support Trump because he is picking Supreme Court Justices I like. People just need to calm down and remember there will be an other election. For me I what immigrants to enter legally, I want my right to work laws and I want very conservative supreme court judges.

Endorsing a person for their inner qualities over their skin color!"Republicans think their races are superior to others and against immigration" - Sorry WHAT!!?? There is no proof of the KKK donating \$20.000 to the Hilary Clinton, but there is no proof of any of the things you just stated either and they are factually wrong! I'm no republican, but the republicans judge people for their inner qualities and not their looks! This is why the republicans want a merit based immigration system, which the democrats and the left in general have OPPOSED! Me and my wife are Immigrants and we are both treated differently according to which \textbf{ethnicity} and citizenship we have. As an example, for me as a Danish citizen, I can technically get a green card as soon as 3 months, whereas my wife, who is Chinese, has to wait more than 6 years, and even after so many years of waiting, it may still be rejected. Since the republicans started talking about the merit based immigration system, the left and the media have only showed disapproval for it! "The Democratic party 150 years ago is not the same that right now." - Maybe you are right! But if they don't hold the same political opinions as they did 150 years ago, then they are not a "Democratic Party", as they wouldn't hold views of democratism. The Democratic Party these days are for open borders (globalization), gun control, high taxes, restrictions on freedom of speech, government controlled health care and government controlled education which are all Socialist views! My point is, peoples opinion can change, but an ideology will always remain the same! \textbf{Race} baiting and strategies like 'get-out-the-vote', is used by the left, purposely to divide our \textbf{nation} by angering and energizing the \textbf{black} voting bloc. It is a strategy that is predicated upon the belief that anyone who disagrees with Democratic policies are simply \textbf{racist}. Under this premise, white men who are not Democrats are \textbf{racist}. White men and women who consider themselves independents, but agree with any of President Trump's policies, are \textbf{racist}. And yes, even white Democrats who are not all in with the 'resist and obstruct' strategy are now considered \textbf{racist}. Here are a few out of thousands of examples of the left displaying \textbf{racism}.Don Lemon who recently said, "The biggest threat to this Country, are white men".

[LINK] Or just the general leftist citizens spewing \textbf{racist} hatred. [LINK]  [LINK]  [LINK]  [LINK]  [LINK] These are not even considered far leftists by the mainstream left, as this IS the mainstream left today!In collusion with liberal mainstream media journalists, the Democratic Party is attempting, through the prism of \textbf{race}, to redefine our country. It's clear who's the real racists! Let me ask you, how many \textbf{racist} Storie do you hear coming out from some of the most conservative states like Vermont, Main, New Hampshire, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Wyoming, Montana, Kansas etc. NON! It all comes from states like California, New York, Maryland, Oregon, Washington state etc. Reason is the left is obsessed with \textbf{race}, and that in itself IS \textbf{racist}! And some of the worst of it it comes from groups like Antifa, \textbf{Black} Lives Matter, MeeToo spouting hatred for white males usually! They support Socialist values like open borders, Gun control, High taxes and large government in general, and in spite of their social justice policies being the same as those of Hitler, Mao, Mussolini, Stalin etc. (esp. Mussolini, as his specific goal was to create a welfare state in Italy, which would function both as an instrument of social justice and an instrument of social control) the left and the Mainstream media don't renounce these groups. Why? Because they support the same values (most do so probably without even being aware)! The right on the other hand constantly denounce all of these groups, including the KKK and the Alt Right as well! So the democratic party indeed has changed and they don't hold views of democratisme anymore, and this switch is something that has happened just recently, cause both Obama and Hilary used to hold democratic views.Conservative states seem more low profile, because right leaning people and conservatives look positively at life and are more happy with whatever the current situation might be, they wish to preserve culture, and they openly love America! The left and the progressives on the other hand, look at America as flawed and even evil! This is why the left freaks out when the president says he's a Nationalist, cause oooh we wouldn't want a president that likes his country, and puts America first! And they think America is fundamentally \textbf{racist}, so Trump being a Nationalist must thus make Trump a \textbf{racist}. That is the thinking of the left, and it's why Ami Horowitz (in the video below) can walk out in California with an American flag, and almost everybody without exception will look down on him and spout hatred for the flag! [LINK] "People in the extreme left are the new PC people, with their own nonsense, but certainly they oppose to the KKK" - NO! Extreme left or far leftism, is Socialism and Communism, which is where most of the left is at right now! And Socialism is as far left as you can go with maximum sized centralized government controlling the means of production. Whereas Libertarianism (where my views mostly lie) is probably as far right as you can go, meaning absolute basic minimal government, maximizing individual freedom. A great contrast is that the ideology of Socialism has killed, and is killing to this day, billions of people! Famous dictators such as Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini, Mao etc. all killed between 25 to 70 million people each, and socialism is the direct causality of it. Whereas Libertarianism or even Conservatism on the other hand are responsible for 0 deaths! Basically speaking, the further right you go, the smaller the government size gets, and when government is small and insignificant, it obviously won't have power to turn tyrannical or invade foreign countries. You might say, the further right you go, the more peace is granted. Switzerland is a good example. It may be the most capitalistic country on earth, it has one of the smallest governments in the world and hasn't had any invasions or tyrannical governments for more than 600 years.I would like to recommend this video below for you, where Dennis Prager makes the difference between Liberals and Leftists clear.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small ‚Äã\@rey  - "Let me put you some example that \textbf{racist} comments and thing that Trump personally have said:" -He began his 2016 presidential campaign with a speech disparaging Mexican immigrants as criminals and 'rapists.' - Very incorrect! He clearly said Illegal immigrants! You are twisting his words! "-He uses the gang MS-13 to disparage all immigrants." - In what way has he done so? As an \textbf{immigrant}, I'm pleased to hear he cares about national safety and security. When he speaks of MS-13, he makes it very clear! Hopefully, you as well would want to see Gang-members who are known to viciously slaughter people get deported or locked up. -In June 2017, Trump said 15,000 recent immigrants from Haiti 'all have AIDS' and that 40,000 Nigerians, once seeing the." -  First of all, there is no proof of him saying this and the White House has denied that he said this! And you may not be aware, but Nigeria is a country not a \textbf{race}! Where is the \textbf{Racism} in anything you just cited? Do you even understand the word \textbf{racism}? A person who shows or feels discrimination or prejudice against people of other races, or who believes that a particular \textbf{race} is superior to another.Why would you even insinuate he's a \textbf{racist} in the first place? You sound like a very kind person, but if you have these things from Brainwashing CNN or MSNBC I would urge you to look around for news sources from both the left and the right! They constantly try and paint him as a \textbf{racist}, even though he's never been accused of being \textbf{racist} until he started running for president! If he's \textbf{racist} then why would he hire, elect and work with \textbf{black} Americans like Ben Carson and \textbf{colored} people in general. He's always been well known for his close relationships with many \textbf{black} rappers. I don't remember this perfectly well, but he also won that reward back in the 80s for being the first one to provide some sort of special care for the \textbf{African} American workers working under him. There is also the well known story of when he free of charge provided Jenifer Hudson and some of her relatives shelter at the Trump holdings after her family was gruesomely murdered in Chicago.The same people who denounce Trump for being a \textbf{racist}, hypocritically oppose Trump's plan for better school options for \textbf{black} children. There have been liberal commentators comparing Trump to George Wallace, the late Alabama governor who defended school segregation and stood in front of the white public schools with armed guards to keep the \textbf{black} children out. Trump is advancing the idea of school choice so that every child can attend a quality school, public or private. In cities such as Washington, D.C., and Milwaukee, the children who benefit from voucher and scholarship programs are predominantly \textbf{black}. Trump wants to increase by tenfold the number of \textbf{black} children who benefit from these vouchers and scholarships. And with that story where Donald Trump sent his own jet across the country, to pick up a sick child with family and medical people and then flew to NYC where the youngster got life saving treatment. Then flew everyone back to the west coast! All because the mother contacted him. Commercial airlines would not help the kid. No profit for Donald Trump and it probably costed Trump \$70,000 each way in fuel and other expenses. With such stories, there Is no denying his huge generosity.The \textbf{black} unemployment rate has fallen by a full percentage point in the last year, \textbf{black} labor force participation is up and the number of \textbf{black} Americans with a job has risen by 600,000 from last year. Preliminary data show \textbf{black} wages and incomes are up since the election. The rate of job growth per month for blacks under Trump has so far been 40 percent higher than the monthly average under ‚ÄéObama. Trump has averaged nearly 30,000 new \textbf{black} jobs per month. That's especially remarkable because Obama was elected when employment was way down. We now have the lowest ever recorded unemployment rates in the US for both \textbf{African} Americans and Hispanics. I have yet to hear a legitimate reason why President trump would be \textbf{racist} and with these things above in mind, I'm gonna say he's the very opposite!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African, Black, Colored, Immigrant, Race, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}26/724 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.591 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Bro, can you write only two or three small ideas. This is too long. I never said that "Republicans think their races are superior to others and against immigration", I said that about KKK and white nationalists.I have seen a lot about Jordan Peterson, and fully agree with him. But people like Micheal Eric Dyson are very far on the left. My concern for the moment is that the middle of the right party is way way to the right, than the middle of the left party. You can see this contrast if you compare politics in USA vs other developed nations. I cannot answer all your points, in your next comment make only one or two, I think is more easier to make the discussion.You said that as you move to the extreme right more peace is granted. That is completely false. I share almost all ideas of the libertarian idea, but libertarian is not far right. Far right is \textbf{nationalism}, protectionism, \textbf{racism}, racial superiority. You look at Jordan Peterson videos, that is something very clearly stated. The reason why Switzerland hasn't attacked anyone is because they have only 8 million people and are a very small country. Look at united states during the all history. The problem is that the american constitution doesn't apply to other countries, so the government can do a lot of shit. By the way, the most "capitalistic " country is Hong Kong, as Milton Friedman said: "Hong Kong is the best example of laissez-faire capitalism ".

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small ‚Äã\@rey  -¬†You wrote "KKK members think that their \textbf{race} is superior to other races, they are against immigration and advocates of the 2nd amendment . Those things are a primary concern of people in the republican party". You directly insinuate that the KKK are republicans or at least they align with them. To insinuate, is just a way to get around directly saying something. Maybe this isn't really what you meant to say, but it is what you wrote.   Minimum wage is just another thing to suppress economic freedom. Sanders wants to raise the minimum wage? Well that just once again shows how deluded he is! In fact all the countries that Bernie Sanders praise like Denmark(where I'm from), Sweden and Norway don't have a minimum wage! "You said that as you move to the extreme right more peace is granted. That is completely false. I share almost all ideas of the libertarian idea, but libertarian is not far right. Far right is \textbf{nationalism}, protectionism, \textbf{racism}, racial superiority." - I apologize if I wasn't clear! And looking at what I wrote I completely acknowledge I wasn't! I'm somewhat making a generalization. What I mean is the further right you go, the less government is favored contrary to the further left you go, the more government is favored. Therefor I put Libertarianism at the very end of the left-right spectrum as they advocate for less government than any other ideology. In Fact, traditionally they want to get rid of the federal government entirely. The Left-wing politics and right-wing politics are often presented as opposed! I didn't mean to refer to the "far-right" (or extreme right). But Far right and far left are not much different from each other, as they both promote \textbf{racism} and fascisms, segregating the populous and punishing the ones that oppose the government or people of certain skin colors and religions. Non of them therefor support small government. They both support big government to an extend where they could control the people, and I would even argue that the "Far-Right", is far left on the left-right spectrum. \textbf{Nationalism} does not belong under the "far right" though! Do a little research and you'll find it's normal right wing politics! "The reason why Switzerland hasn't attacked anyone is because they have only 8 million people and are a very small country." Sorry mate that is completely falls! Britains population was only 3.5 million people in the 16th century when they set out to concur the world, and they succeeded controlling half of it for hundreds of years. 70 percent of the Chinese population is either of Korean or Japanese descent. Despite the much larger population in China, these countries have numerous times invaded China and controlled vast areas of China. You may not know this, but my Country (Denmark), used to consist of both Denmark, England, Norway and Sweden and a big part of Germany. Despite the tiny population of Denmark, which was much smaller when the vikings where around, whey where able to go to war with these countries and win! And in more recent history, all the countries in EU have small populations, yet all but 2 countries (Switzerland and Sweden) have been invaded or have had tyranny numerous times just in the last 100 years! And it's not a coincidence that both Sweden and Switzerland along with the US (Which hasn't had tyranny or invasions at all), has the highest rates of gun ownership in the world! Switzerland being the most interesting one, with more than 45 firearms per 100 people and more than 35 per 100 people of those, are either Simi or fully automatic military firearms. Switzerland remains the only country in the world where any citizen above 18 years \textbf{old}, after going through the background checks, can buy modern fully automatic firearms (Something you can't even do in the US)! \textbf{Nobody} dares to invade a country where almost every male citizen is armed! It is also for this reason the Japanese chose not to do a land invasion in the US. As Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto said "'We did indeed know much about your preparedness. We knew that probably every second home in your country contained firearms. We knew that your country actually had state championships for private citizens shooting military rifles. We were not fools to set foot in such quicksand''. The safest countries also tend to be the most conservative countries that reject Socialism. Countries like the US and Switzerland. I think it's as simple as that! "The problem is that the american constitution doesn't apply to other countries, so the government can do a lot of shit. " I think it's simply because the US government has grown too large, and technically it shouldn't be allowed to make a simple move without the consent of the people, voting yes or no for whatever bill or change is being suggested! "Bernie could not do that if he were president, congress won't allow that. And I think that I could do a better job as president, and I'll prefer him than Trump., because at least is more honest" - One of the reasons Trump was elected is the fact because he speaks from his heart. No teleprompters! Which in most people eyes makes him more trustable. Why don't you find him trustable? So far he has provided and achieved almost everything he promised! I find Bernie Sanders to be a much more untrustworthy person than even Hilary Clinton. Bernie Sanders praised Venezuela 20 years ago, and he conveniently praised it right until it failed! He even said he thought it was a good thing, that the Venezuelan population was dependent on the government, having to line up to get food from the government. And recently, Sanders said quote "When I'm talking about Democratic Socialism, I'm Not looking at Venezuela! I'm looking at counties like Denmark and Sweden." Except that all nordic countries are marked based Capitalist countries! In fact there is not one single 1st world country that is a socialist country! Bernie Sanders is either deluded or a liar saying these things. With all the educations he's got, and socialism being his major and expertise, he certainty would know this basic knowledge, that even I random guy behind a computer knows! "By the way, the most "capitalistic " country is Hong Kong, as Milton Friedman said: "Hong Kong is the best example of laissez-faire capitalism ". Look at the index of" I'm sure when Friedman was around this was true, and maybe it still somewhat is. But I've lived and worked in Hong Kong, and since China has taken control of it, they have broken all the agreements with the Brits, and are slowly taking full control! I know several people that have fled from Hong Kong because of this. They are for the first time ever imposing corporate taxes, changing the laws and I even believe they are taking control of the Military, not sure about that last one though. As for the index ratings, you really can't trust many of those as they tend to be completely flawed! An example would be freedom index ratings always putting countries like Germany, Britain and Sweden higher than the US, even though they are countries where thousands are arrested, punished, jailed, fined etc. for practicing basic rights such as free speech and self defense! It's horrifying that cases such as what's happening with Tommy Robinson, is just one of 12 every day in the UK alone! These countries have 10 times more regulations and laws than most states in the US have, equaling less freedom! Yet these "Professionals" still put the US far down on the list. It simply doesn't make sense! I'm sorry for jumping into a completely different subject, but for anybody that sees this reply, If you aren't informed on the Tommy Robinson case, I urge you to look it up, so you can see how countries like the UK treats it's citizens when they arrest them for speech! Go to 7.40 in the video below where Tommy starts talking about his latest prison visit (most of it spend in solitary), for saying something the government didn't like.  [LINK]   Or watch this video for the short version. [LINK] If you've watched this video, remember, Tommy is statistically just 1 out of 12 people every day having to deal with this, in this case in the UK!I'm really sorry if you think I write too much.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Large, indeed :). At least all ideas are is split between paragraphs. I'll follow the same format than you to answer.Countries like  Sweden and Norway, Denmark don't need minimum because in part the don't have the level of immigration that US has. It has been documented that low skilled immigration affects mainly low paying jobs, therefore the supply of people for those job increase. So , in a country(developed) were you don't have immigration , the "supply" of low skilled people tend to decrease with time. I don't agree that MW should be set at the federal level, but I would like that different states try it. For example, here in Washington state the MW is 11.50 and the unemployment is very low, around 4. So, for me if you raise the MW and the unemployment stay the same and \textbf{nothing} changes is good. Even when is true, that in the technical sense is suppression of "economic freedom", in fact, I thing that suppression of "economic freedom" is a little exaggerated, because for the person that is working on that there is no freedom. Also , remember that the market is not perfect, is the least bad of all solutions that we know. When I refereed to the example of Switzerland  and its population, also I was referring to the fact, that compared with other countries is not that powerful. England, in its moment conquer half of the world because was the most powerful \textbf{nation}, as US is right now. Even if the state is small, national defense is owned by the state, I think that function is one of the basic functions for the state from the point of view of libertarians. But made the population vote for the decisions in a large country is very difficult. In my opinion the only way that you can avoid that the US government attacks other places is make a constitutional amendment to only attack in case of invasion or if a super majority on congress vote for that. About Hong Kong. I'm only talking about economic freedom, not press not political freedom. In fact you don't need political freedom to achieve economic freedom, Chile was an example, as Singapore is right now or Hong Kong. Those index of freedom of press etc are not made as the index of economic freedom is done. Those are made by surveys etc. The index of economic freedom take into account 5 factors: taxes, size of government , business freedom etc. It's not perfect but is widely used by a lot of economist etc. I agree also that since China took over Hong Kong economic freedom has decreased, but even right now, they are way more economically freedom that USA, low taxes, no tariff for importation nor exportation , very small government(something interesting is that Hong provides health care mainly through government), small deficit etc. Now about Trump and Sanders etc. Because Sander supported a place like Venezuela in some point you cannot discard him. Everyone at some points of their life support people that have done wrong things. Right now, you have Trump supporting the government of Saudi Arabia even when the US intelligence agencies have said that were they. But, he doesn't care if Saudi Arabia killed and ripped apart a journalist. For me that is way more dangerous than Sanders supporting Venezuela few years ago. This goes to the core of freedom and your principles. Something that I think that Trump doesn't have. Also, when Sanders supported the Venezuelan government was because in 3 years Hugo Chavez make Venezuela almost an illiteracy free country and brought down a lot of corruption and poor people in Venezuela started to have better life conditions. The problem with the ideology of Venezuela and Cuba etc, is that in the first few years everyone sees an improvement, but in the long term thing got worse, at least this is my opinion coming from a \textbf{communist} country :).I think let me also point this. Venezuela was moving in the same direction than Cuba, with a \textbf{communist} party and full control of everything. That was socialism at the extreme. When Bernie or me talk about countries like Sweden , Denmark etc, is to have a social safety net for people in the bottom, health care, and few basic services. That is fully compatible with a free market system. For me, these should be the main roles of a government in a free society: Army,police etc to protects their citizen , court of law were individuals can resolve their conflicts and what between all of us and voluntarily we cannot achieve. Let me see the videos about Tommy Robinson and then I will reply :)\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Communist, Nation, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Age - Youngsters, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}4/788 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.508 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small ‚Äã\@rey  - I won't argue with your first reply, as I agreed with most of it. But in the next one you are factually wrong!"You said that "the more conservatives countries are the safest". Seriously, that is completely false. US has the highest crime rate country among the developed nations. It's around 5 deaths per 100 000 people. For example, Canada has 1.3 , UK 0.9, Spain 0.7 , Switzerland 0.7 etc." First of all Switzerland is far more Conservative and capitalistic than the US, so this ones again proves my point! But to compare a large superpower with 50 sovereign states, to small EU countries in such a generalizing manner obviously doesn't make any sense. The Tenth Amendment expresses the principle of federalism and states' rights, which strictly supports the entire plan of the original Constitution for the United States of America, by stating that the federal government possesses only those powers delegated to it by the United States Constitution. All remaining powers are reserved for the states or the people. This is why every US state is almost as different from each other, as the different countries in Europe. Every state is unique in its own way. They have their own governments, laws, culture, nature, accents, climate etc. Hence, the statistic you have presented, is profoundly generalized. When digging into those crude stats, which only reveals the median numbers of the US, you'll find many negative numbers, but you'll also find much better numbers! First of all general violent crime rate is rated higher in EU than the US. And states like South Dakota, Minnesota, Vermont, North Dakota, Montana, Main, New Hampshire, Iowa, Idaho Wyoming Utah etc. are very peaceful states with low crimes rates and they all have some of the lowest murder rates in the entire world all below 3 out of 100,000 people! And the ones with the lowest are New Hampshire 0.9 in 2014,    North Dakota was rated at 0.6 in 2000, South Dakota was rated at 0.9 in 2000, Maine rated at 1.2 in 2000, Vermont 1.1 in 2010 etc. Some of them have increased and decreased over the years, but they are non the less extremely low, and only a couple other countries have similar low numbers. And ones again non of any of the states mentioned are left leaning states. The countries in EU with the lowest murder rates are Austria and Switzerland (Which also happens to be the most conservative) and the states in the US with the lowest crime and murder rates, as proven, are also among the most conservative US states. "China has less level of crime and murdered than USA. I only said this because every time that I ask a Chinese about this they said that they feel safer in China" - Sorry mate you can't win that one. China is a socialist dictatorial country, and they would never allow the real numbers to come out! Moreover the Chinese police don't even respond to 90 percent of calls. You can easily kill somebody in China and the police wouldn't care. My wifes' body is filled with scars from muslim gangs in China torturing her, beating her, cutting her with barber knifes etc. For 10 years they stole hundreds of thousands of dollars from her businesses, controlled her life, and in spite of calling the police thousands of times, hireling lawyers, contacting global domestic abuse organizations, \textbf{nobody} ever did anything. The few times the police would show, they would say "it's not my job". And one of these qycorpaths even used to live in the US as an illegal \textbf{alien}. He killed a man and in turkey then fled to the US. He lived here for 20 years and wasn't deported until he beat up an \textbf{elderly} lady. This guy is still living in China, and the only reason my wife's life is not controlled by these muslims anymore, is because I helped her escape from China, to a country where she now has the right to protect herself. This clearly shows as well, how flawed the US immigrations system is, and how weak our borders are.Don't you find it wired that when looking at a map of Murder rates, even some ISIS controlled countries and countries at war have low murder rates? You obviously can't trust stats out of 2nd and 3rd world countries! Every time mass murders happen in China, the government sweeps the area. They then go door to door, and threaten people with prison time if they report it, or tell anyone about it. Remember I lived and worked in China and my wife is Chinese! Little children are killed by the hundreds of millions by the government or abducted and sold as \textbf{sex} slaves, or sold to pharmasutical organizations and hospitals where they are slaughtered and their vital organs sold to the highest bidder. In fact my wife, have lost several friends because of this and she has friends that have lost children and loved ones to it. I could never imagine what the total annual death toll would be, if all the numbers of dead could be compiled. Unfortunately anybody trying to do research on this in China are usually found in a dumpster the next day, killed by the government. "I only said this because every time that I ask a Chinese about this they said that they feel safer in China" - Chinese always tend to love their country. But then you start hearing about how many of their friends of family have been abducted or killed and you realize something is wrong! Chinese are absolutely brainwashed in Schools! They are taught to love Mao, and even foreign dictators. The biggest idol of one of my wifes' friends is Stalin! By the way, don't buy Huaway phones! The Chinese government requires from the company to put surveillance chips in their phones and that includes the ones being sold in the US!

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@rey ‚Äã- Hey Rey. I've studied these stats a big part of my life! "I did the same in the EU and couldn't find any country with more than 2 murders per 100 000. In fact , UK and France who have garnered the media attention for very unsafe places in EU have 1.2 murders." - Well then you certainly didn't look carefully, because the murder rate for the European Union alone is 2.69, and if you included all of Europe including the high crime countries, the number would be much higher! Ukraine was rated at 6.34 in 2014,  Montenegro, was rated at 4.46 in 2016,  Latvia rated at 3.36 in 2015, Lithuania rated at 6.00 in 2015,  Belarus rated at 3.58 in 2014 etc. not to mention European Russia, rated at 11.30 in 2015, which occupies almost 40 of Europe's total area. And the European portion of Turkey known as Thrace, and turkey overall being rated at 4.31 in 2014. France and the UK are not considered some of the most dangerous places in Europe at all, but London and Paris have very high murder rates! Both the UK and France have some of the lower murder rates in Europe.  [LINK]  [LINK]  [LINK] The United States, with an average murder rate of approximately 5 per 100,000 is compared to a variety of Western and Central European countries (also sometimes Japan) with murder rates often below 1 per 100,000. This is, in turn, supposed to fill Americans with a sense of shame and illustrate that the United States should be regarded as some sort of pariah \textbf{nation} because of its murder rate.Note, however, that these comparisons always employ a carefully selected list of countries, most of which are very unlike the United States. They are countries that were settled long ago by the dominant \textbf{ethnic} group, they are ethnically non-diverse today, they are frequently very small countries (such as Norway, with a population of 5 million) with very locally based democracies (again, unlike the US with an immense population and far fewer representatives in government per voter). Politically, historically, and demographically, the US has little in \textbf{common} with Europe or Japan. And also remember, the vast majority of murders in the US come from very specific states! There where around 15.140 murders in the US in 2015. 1,861 where killed in California, 1,276 where killed in Texas, 1,149 where killed in Florida, 651 where killed in Pennsylvania, 611 where killed in New York state and 571 where killed in Michigan (Notice how 4 out of 6 of those states are also among the most left leaning states). Combined that's 6,119, meaning 40.41 or almost half of all combine murders in the US, comes from 5 states out of 50 US states!   [LINK]  [LINK] "Also, states like Vermont or Oregon that are very safe are not conservatives. These states are very liberals. The fact that the number of guns is high doesn't imply that are conservatives." - You do know that there is a big difference between liberal, leftist and democrat right. Most true liberals actually tend to be pro gun. Oregon is indeed a majority left voting state, but murder rates in Oregon range between 2-4. Not high, but not among the lowest either. Vermont (Murder rate between 1-2) is more or less a swing state I guess. They voted for Hilary in 2016, but Phil Scott won by more than 55 in the midterms, and all but one county (Windham County), voted \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} with some counties reaching 70 republican votes. "My only point is that crime is not related to be conservative. Do you consider Texas, Louisiana and the state in the south be conservatives? Because in my definition they are. They are religious, very republicans in the sense of no taxes , for the 2nd amendment etc." - They are definitely majority conservative. But all southern states have high crime rates because they are right on the border where more than half million illegal immigrants pour across annually, and more than 90 percent of all drugs are estimated to be coming from the souther border. And according to the Texas department of safety, between 2011 and 2018 more than 663.000 crimes where committed by illegal immigrants. And according to DHS status indicators, over 270,000 criminal aliens have been booked into local Texas jails between June 1, 2011 and October 31, 2018, of which over 182,000 were classified as illegal aliens by DHS, so it's clear that it's not your average Texas farmer committing the crimes and murders. [LINK] I'm talking in general terms! Look at it this way, on the flip side if you will. There is not, and there has never been one single conservative or capitalist country in the world that has or has ever been a dictatorship. All dictatorial countries are far left Socialist and "\textbf{Communist}" countries, using big government to control the populous, and impose social justice laws. "Also if you go beyond Europe, to Japan, Canada, Australia, New Zealand etc, all those countries are safer than US." - Now if we talk about general safety, that is far from the truth! As an example, general mortality rate is quite a bit higher in the UK, Lithuania, Ukraine, Italy, Poland, Sweden etc. and most EU countries as a matter of fact compared to the US, which clearly shows on the map, which link for I've added below .Death rate= Average annual number of deaths during a year per 1,000 population at midyear; also known as crude death rate.UNITED STATES     Between 7-8     (2006) EST.EUROPE       Between 9-10   (2006) EST.Source:   [LINK]  Updated CIA stats from 2017 show equal results where most EU countries rank between 9.20 to 14.60. JAPAN was rated at 9.80, and CANADA at 8.70. A Lot higher than the US rated at 8.20! AUSTRALIA though, was rated lower at 7.30, and that goes for NEW ZEALAND as well, rated at 7.50.Crude death rate stats for individual US states do not exist, but remember, if we could dig into the stats for individual US states, we would obviously find much better numbers for some states, but also worse numbers for other states!Source:  [LINK] CRUDE DEATH RATE! That means it includes all causes of death. Including all kinds of homicide, car deaths, deaths through \textbf{alcohol}, cancer, \textbf{old} \textbf{age}, Infant Mortality Rate, Neonatal Mortality Rate etc. etc. etc.And the notion many people make, that Europe in general is safer than the US is \textbf{nothing} but silly! How many world wars came out of the US? Non where even started by 2nd or 3rd world countries, they both came out of EU. How many Berlin walls have been build in the US? And how many times have the US had dictators or dictatorship? NON! EU has had more dictatorships in the last century than I can count, and many of them I've never even heard of!

If that were truly the case, I think billions of Muslims and myself included would be committing a sin. This very specific verse refers to a time of the Prophet when the 'Jews and Christians were in open conflict with the Muslims, there were some Muslims who were more concerned about maintaining there alliances with the Jews and Christians at the expense of the Muslim community. The above verse is referring to such situations where Muslims with doubts in their hearts will ally themselves with the enemy.' So this does not apply to modern day society.

Do not spare them, but kill both man and \textbf{woman}, child and infant, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.'

I didn't find out what was happening to Minnesota until 2010, and I was routinely watching evening broadcast news, CNN and reading the Star Tribune. Now I don't use any of those news sources since I began receiving news about Minnesota from OUTSIDE Minnesota. We have been betrayed by Governor Mark Dayton who was voted in because of name recognition. He is nearly a falling down drunk now heavily medicated with psychotropics, as best I can tell from watching videos of him speaking to groups of Somalis. The broadcast media celebrated him, same with the newspaper. The news used to be fairly trustworthy back in the 80s and prior but the Star Tribune has become a rag with a nearly illiterate editor. Most articles have a byline that is a name that suggests their English is a second language. Minnesotans nearly gave Trump a win on Minnesota. Shane,  I need to modify your comment that "Minnesota" doesn't care about its small town working class and farmers. Minnesotans have had their "Minnesota Nice" used against them by the \textbf{Refugee} Resettlement Industry and Minnesota Senators with their eyes focused on the economy. Now I live near the other large population of Somalis in Minnesota . . in Central Minnesota . . and I'm seeing evidence that the Somali males and illegal Mexicans are working in slaughterhouses. Looks like some Minnesota farmers are linked to the use of labor from poor countries. I really hate being around the Somali guys who can be so easily radicalized. The mall a mile from me experienced a stabbing assault on 10 shoppers by a Somali male who was described as one of the most assimilated! He was shot dead by an off duty cop on 9.17.16.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The problem is that members of free societies are ill-prepared to accept that an ideology such as Islam requires the calculation of their destruction even BEFORE Muslim believers begin to arrive onto their territories. Jihad does NOT begin with the beheading of Christians. The first, and perhaps the most important phase of jihad, is to compel masses of believers to infiltrate a host \textbf{nation}. Even if their numbers are not initially large compared to the number of secular citizens already living in that society the odds are immediately stacked against the survival of the host culture for the primary reason that civilized societies are always monogamous. Islam, however, encourages every male to have up to 4 wives and an unlimited brood with each. (Not too different from latino populations which are monogamous only ‚Äòin theory'.) Within a generation or two the indigenous population of the host \textbf{nation} is dangerously out-populated by masses of people who drop the overall IQ level of that \textbf{nation} by considerable points. These are easily controlled, greedy masses that use their newly acquired, unearned 'rights' to compel a rapid political and cultural implosion of their host nations. Only when the demographic situation is sufficiently ripe does the second, more brutal phase of jihad begin. It is critical to remember that the objective of EVERY practicing Islamist is JIHAD. The 'peaceful' Muslim believer signs onto phase one of the process, to systematically parasitize and 'seduce' a culture, while the radical believer follows up with the all-out frontal attack of phase two. Those who take on the role of the first phase pretend to be 'offended' when one points out their \textbf{imperialist} intentions while the second phasers delight in the shocked expression on the faces of the victims they are about to sacrifice. Both groups are culpable. Both are equally dangerous to everything our forefathers fought, bled and died to provide us. Brigette Gabriel describes the takeover of (Christian) Lebanon:  [LINK]  True Islam (by William Federer) [LINK] (To every muslim who wants to do the 'right thing': It is your responsibility to read the \textbf{Quran}, Hadith and Sirra COVER TO COVER, in a language you understand and then to take full PERSONAL responsibility for your choice to serve your 'god' as well as for YOUR PARTICIPATION in the call to destroy the creations that better men have built.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The state of Israel is not the biblical Israel. The true Christian Church is the Israel of the Bible. I don't understand how all of you can ignore the very words of the Messiah himself, when he said to the Jews your temple lies desolate. When he said to the Jews that the message will go out to another people. And I can give you about another dozen off the top of my head up quotes from God himself about Israel and why the scepter will be given to another people because of their disobedience. You do realize that the Messiah of Israel is Jesus Christ, right? You do realize that those Jews murdered Jesus Christ? That's hardly a people who we're following the Messiah. They still can't get it through their thick heads that the Messiah and Jesus Christ are one and the same. Daniel 9:24- 27 makes it clear that Israel had a 490 year probation and if they did not come to the accepting of the truth and following God that the message would go out to another people. That the message would go out to the Gentiles. Those Gentiles are called the Christian church. What do you think Paul and Peter were? They were Christian. There's not two messages. Christ is not double-minded. The message went out in ad 34 to the Christian church. Israel is the Christian church or I should say the true Christian Church.

Getting rid of abortion is a good thing. Overturning the ability for homosexuals to get married is a good thing. Bringing prayer back into public schools is a good thing. But it will not end there and that is the problem. They will continue to combine church and state until what we have is a repeat of what happened during the Dark Ages. Human nature will be human nature period over 50 million people were murdered because they wanted to know the truth about God period between Islam and Roman Catholicism that's how many people were murdered during the Dark Ages. That's why there was a Protestant Reformation. That's why the United States was settled by Christian running away from the persecution in Europe. The whole purpose of the United States was to get away from church and state relationship that Rome had with the European nations. So what? We're going to just go ahead and repeat that? Yes, that's what the Bible says is going to happen. So I realized that many of the things Trump is doing sounds good, but in reality him in the Democrats are working for the same people. The Democrats want to bring in a bunch of regulations because of it what they consider is climate change. This will also bring in a church-state relationship because the Roman Catholic Church and toast is backing climate change and so they therefore agree with the Democrats. So we have the room in church agreeing with Trump on some things, and then agreeing with the Democrats on other things. That's because they're running both parties.

Jesus said narrow is the way that leads to heaven and wide is the road to destruction. there is no sin in heaven or on the new Earth, so you must prepare yourself now to live without sin in heaven and on the new Earth. If we could all just send and go to heaven then there would have been no point for God to kick Lucifer Out of Heaven, and no need for Jesus Christ to die on the cross.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@O'Rileyfrom Cork brother, there are actually three comings of Jesus Christ. The first was obviously when the Son of God was born in a manger being fully God, but also fully human. The second coming of Christ is about to be fulfilled when the Lord Jesus comes in the atmosphere and reawakens those who are sleeping in the grave and are saved. Jesus Christ will not touch the Earth at his second coming. This is extremely important to understand because Satan is going to counterfeit the second coming of Jesus Christ. But he will not be allowed to fully duplicate it. This basically means that Satan will be walking around claiming to be God and performing miracles. These will not be some type of magician tricks, but actually supernatural miracles which will deceive most of those on Earth, especially the atheists. That is why the Bible says if they say that Jesus is in the mountains or in the desert go not out to see him because it will not be Jesus Christ. Jesus will not touch the Earth at his second coming. Jesus does touch the Earth at his third coming. The Bible says that he touches the Mount of Olives and it Cleaves to form a huge plain big enough to allow the city of Jerusalem to land in that area. When Jesus touches the Earth he purifies that section of the Earth so that the purified city of New Jerusalem will not be soiled by the sin and filth of this Earth. This third coming does not happen until the Millennium is over. So between the second coming of Jesus and the third coming of Jesus is period known as the millennium. So it would be impossible for you to wait for Jesus to come to that spot because if you're not in the city coming down with Jesus in the first place then you did not make it in the first resurrection at the second coming. At the second coming there are four groups of people. Those who are alive and saved. Those who are alive and wicked and lost. Those who are dead and saved. And those who are dead and lost. When Jesus enters the atmosphere of the Earth the dead in Christ will rise first to receive their new bodies and go to heaven for a thousand years. The wicked dead will remain in their graves for that Thousand Years. The wicked living will be killed by the brightness of Jesus Christ and they will try to run for the caves in the mountains but they will not Escape. They will lie when the earth dead for the beginning of that Thousand Years. The living saved will then rise up to Jesus after the others and receive their new bodies. Then they will all go to heaven for 1000 years. After A Thousand Years the city of New Jerusalem will come down out of heaven with the redeemed in it and land on a purified Mount Olive that has turned into a large plain. At this time Jesus will rise above the city of New Jerusalem and Shout to the Dead and they will arise out of their graves and also of the Earth where they laid. Satan and his Fallen Angels who have been on this Earth without anyone to tempt for 1000 years will now go around to these billions of people to tempt them to attack the city and take it from Jesus. We do not know how long this period will be but I imagine it will take a couple months or more because the Earth is totally destroyed at the second coming and they will try to attack the city with weapons. So they will have to make those weapons somehow. You will have some of the greatest generals and wicked men that the world has ever seen in one large army. As they approach the city of New Jerusalem the father will rain fire and brimstone Out of Heaven and the wicked will burn to ashes in front of the redeemed. They will be gone forever. They will be dead forever and the redeemed will be alive forever. Then Jesus will walk out of the city of New Jerusalem and will recreate the entire Earth in front of the redeemed human \textbf{race}. There will be no more sin and our planet will once more rejoin the universe of people who live without sin.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small That's just a secular state it has \textbf{nothing} to do with Jesus Christ. Most of the people over there aren't even real Jews. Israel is controlled by the Pope and they should not even have that land. That land was guaranteed to the original Hebrews as long as they remain faithful to God. They ceased to remain faithful to God on numerous occasions, including being so rebellious that they started worshipping Baal. It got so bad that God allow the Babylonians to capture Jerusalem and take them into captivity for 70 years. But they did not learn their lesson and after captivity under the Greeks and the Romans they basically cease to be God's people any longer, culminating in the murder of the son of God. White Jesus said to them your house is left unto you desolate. After the murder of Stephen in a d-34 they cease to be God's people any longer. They can be saved as individuals if they accept Jesus Christ, but the message has gone out to the Christian church and that is your modern day Israel. I cannot understand how anyone can read the Bible and not come to this understanding. They let a thief and murderer go in order to murder their own Messiah. There is no separation between the Jew and Greek. That cannot be any clearer in the Bible.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@IronskullGM The freedom of speech is nearly unlimited in Europe, as is self defence, but instead of shooting at each other, we try to talk (by the way most of the people I speak to say that they want to keep the guns, as if there comes a tyrant, they can act, but...\textbf{nobody} is acting now....and of course it is totally silly, as no gun can act against a tyrant, as we see now). No free gun laws (in not one singel developed country anymore!): That is why Europe is so much saver than the USA (far and far less killings, and far and far less people in prison). I am normally right wing, but it depends on the circumstances and differs per country. In the USA I would of course support Clinton, as she is a super experienced and bright person, versus the total moron trump is. Was e.g. NOT a fan of Mitterand, but also did not like Chirac, but liked Felipe Gonzalez, was NOT a fan of the Olaf Palme, but liked Wim Kok, was NOT a fan of Schroeder, but did like Kohl, adored Sa Carmeiro, but also Maria da Pinta Silga, and of course am a great fan of the prime minister of Serbia (Brnabic), and dislike PIS, Erdogan and Orban (our trump disasters), so more often than not I would vote right wing in Europe (which is more or less democrat in the USA, as republican would be considered as extreme right in Europe). We are CITIZENS, as most of us vote, not like in the USA, where only the more well off do vote, as it is made extremely difficult for poor people to vote (that is why there is always a total fake bias towards republican logic, not representing the USA people), and hence the democracy is a fake one, as money rules everything, not the people. It is again the same as with your Universities: you can make a nice story, but in practice the money has the power (now Wall Street, NRA, anti climate lobby, big pharma and billionaires, some other times some other lobby groups). Monarchs in Europe have \textbf{NOTHING} to say, so are more or less only a very appreciated binding factor (lets say: the opposite of Trump, or anti Trumps), which as such is a good thing for most of the countries, as we can vote them out with one vote, but democratically do not.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Geert Termeer - ‚Äã Geert Termeer - Free speech nearly unlimited in EU huh? Then please explain why thousands are arrested, punished, jailed, fined etc.in countries like Germany, Britain and Sweden for practicing basic rights such as free speech and self defense! It's horrifying that cases such as what's happening with Tommy Robinson, is just one of 12 every day in the UK alone!¬†A very few EU countries technically do have a right to self defence, and to use firearms against criminal attackers. But with Most EU countries laws requiring guns to be Locked in a safe, unloaded, taken apart, and furthermore prohibiting what kind of firearm you can use and not use, and even how you may and may not use it, the most EU countries governments, have obviously rendered it impossible to use firearms for self-defense! And no matter how defenseless you are, \textbf{elderly}, young female, \textbf{handicapped} person etc. or if you're a person in grave danger receiving death threats, or if you live in nature with dangerous wild animals, concealed and open carry is illegal in all of Europe with the exception of Swizerland where you can carry only if valid proof of your life being in danger is provided.EU safer than the US? That is a joke right???!!! All but 2 countries in EU (Switzerland and Sweden) have been invaded or have had tyranny numerous times just in the last 100 years! And it's not a coincidence that both Sweden and Switzerland along with the US (Which hasn't had tyranny or invasions at all), has the highest rates of gun ownership in the world! Switzerland being the most interesting one, with more than 45 firearms per 100 people and more than 35 per 100 people of those, are either Simi or fully automatic military firearms. Switzerland remains the only country in the world where any citizen above 18 years \textbf{old}, after going through the background checks, can buy modern fully automatic firearms (Something you can't even do in the US)! \textbf{Nobody} dares to invade a country where almost every male citizen is armed! It is also for this reason the Japanese chose not to do a land invasion in the US. As Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto said "'We did indeed know much about your preparedness. We knew that probably every second home in your country contained firearms. We knew that your country actually had state championships for private citizens shooting military rifles. We were not fools to set foot in such quicksand''. The safest countries also tend to be the most conservative countries that reject Socialism. Countries like the US and Switzerland. I as simple as that! States like South Dakota, Minnesota, Vermont, North Dakota, Montana, Main, New Hampshire, Iowa, Idaho Wyoming Utah etc. are very peaceful states with low crimes rates and they all have some of the lowest murder rates in the entire world all below 3 out of 100,000 people!I was born in Denmark. It's one of the least free and frankly least happy 1st world countries there is! I lived in Europe for more than 20 years. I've lived and worked in China for 3 years, swell as several other countries and I currently live in the US.! Paid more than 50 taxes when I lived in DK, even though I had a very low paying job. A job that I spend 2 years looking for, as it's nearly impossible to get a job in this country. I could barely even afford the 100 yr \textbf{old} bike I was riding to work on 3 am every day, in freezing cold, rainy, stormy weather. Lift and Uber is Illegal in Denmark, and there is no public transport early in the morning. You can't move a finger without having to pay some sort of tax there. You even pay taxes for paying the taxes! Additionally, you pay 25 taxes for literally everything you buy. Including a piece of \textbf{fruit} from a grocery store. They even have NUT TAXES. NOT A JOKE! And people always leave out the thousands of additional taxes, like the 180 car tax, and the near 300 tax for electricity!Also remember that Denmark is one of the most pricey countries in the world. All prices in Denmark are on average 3 times more than in the US as an example. A lot of Danes have to buy a lot of their things, even food sometimes, from overseas because they can't afford the Danish prices.  On the few days where it's warm enough to walk outside your house, one can't feel safe for one second because of the violent nature of the intoxicated Danes. One street in Denmark will look like a completely different one next year, because the amount of taxation and business sanctions are so high, that everyone trying to start a business, instantly go broke. People pay so much taxes there, that people have to storm to the banks to withdraw money after payday, because the final salary after tax, is so low, people don't have enough money to live comfortably, \textbf{witch} is also part of the reason why so many business owners close, cause people don't have enough money to go spend. The low quality of life shows clearly in the transportation choosings of the Danes. Few people own cars in Denmark! In fact, even Iraq has more vehicles per capita than Denmark. The few that do transport via automobiles, will mostly drive in very low quality, small, soulless hatchbacks. The Danes mostly transport themselves with public transport or bikes. And it's certainly not out of pleasure they do it as the weather is absolutely horrific!And oh, isn't it fun to receive letters from the government of Denmark, requiring peaceful, tax paying citizens to do this and that at this time and place, otherwise they will send police with guns, and take you to jail. It really makes my day receiving threats from the government. I'm of cause referring to the mandatory military service, which Denmark still has and several other EU countries still has! One of the most anti freedom things in existence!There are so many regulations and laws in Denmark, one can almost not move a pinky without breaking some kind of law. My Grandfather can't count the times he's been arrested and fined for carrying a damn multitool! The knife on it is no more than 2 inches but it's still considered illegal and he's forced to pay the government thousands of dollars. Yes they have knife control in Denmark! I also know a guy who decided about 6 years ago to sit in his own garden and eat an \textbf{apple}. Sounds pretty innocent right! NOT IN DENMARK! He used a knife to cut the \textbf{apple}, an \textbf{old} lady saw this from the window and called the police! The police showed up at his door step. They confiscated his knife, he had to pay almost 500 dollars in fine and he spent a week in jail. Ohh, what an evil man he was for eating an \textbf{apple}! It happens frequently that professional cooks and chefs are having to pay thousands of dollars in fine for having their knifes in the car. There even was a time in the 90s where it was illegal to dig holes in beaches. WHY? Because somebody twisted an angle as he accidentally stepped into a hole a child had dug. But fear not, because the government would swoop in to save the day with another nonsensical regulation of insanity. I myself have been arrested and fined for sleeping outside, iv'e been attacked by a whole force of police with dogs, arrested and heavily fined for making a campfire to keep me and my friend warm so we wouldn't freaking die. Iv'e been arrested for setting up a tent etc. I also have stories about family members of mine, dying at 40 years \textbf{old} in their hospitals. Hospitals that are so bad, my dear aunt didn't even die from hear actual illness. She died on Christmas from the sheer depression, and horrible food from those depression bunkers they in DK call Hospitals. Hospitals that we pay between 50 to 65 and often higher taxes for, not to mention the hundreds of other additional taxes people pay there. This is what happens when governments are centralized and it irrefutably is the very opposite of freedom! Frankly dictatorial in my opinion!!!I don't need to go further than 20 years back where most people could walk into gun stores and buy guns without permits, but once they start taking a little, at some point they will take it all. That applies to pretty much all EU countries and as a matter of fact most countries in EU, especially Sweden, Germany, France, Spain and the UK have seen dramatic increases in crimes rates in the past decades, right alongside and in coexistence with the constant increases in gun regulations. All that time I lived in DK, I almost never went outdoors, which greatly of cause has to do with the horrible weather, and the fact that anything fun and educational is either too expensive, not possible or banned in DK. I did the best I could to keep a low profile, and not get into trouble. Yet, Iv'e been through these things, and yet despite of doing my best to avoid confrontations with the Danes, I can't get away from people mocking, and yelling at me cause they don't like the way I dress. Denmark among the happiest countries in the world? Yeah..Meanwhile the Danes themselves, are researching about why the Danes have such high depression and suicide rates and why the Danes always look so displeased and angry. When I was in High school in DK, 1/4 of my classmates suffered from depression and they would sometimes break out in tears in the middle of the classroom from pure misery!Foreign journalist travel there and ask, "Why is Denmark a great place to live?" They put on the most ridiculously sad face and mention High taxes and free health care. Like THAT'S the key to happiness? Hopefully most people watching that, can recognize the irony and get a laugh out of it!To be continued....\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Apple, Elderly, Fruit, Handicapped, Nobody, Old, Witch & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Native-American, Gender - Female age and physical appearance, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality & \cellcolor{green!5}12/1707 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.703 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Geert Termeer  - A couple of facts! Denmark ranked first for land use(lowest amount of nature)cancer: The highest cancer rate for men and women together was found in Denmark5th highest: Cost of living > Transport prices8th highest among developed countries: Crime > Total crimes per 1000Denmark ranked first for tax > highest marginal tax rateDenmark ranked first for spendingDenmark has had the highest municipal wastes (commonly known as trash or garbage)The Danish government have almost totally depleted the country from all nature, which has led to the dying out of thousands of species like wolfs, wild boars and elks. So even if the people of Denmark where doing good and where free, what about the animals and the wildlife. Most of it doesn't even exist anymore!It's also among the most gloomiest countries in the world: Iceland, Scotland, Ireland, Northern-Ireland, Wales, Norway, England, Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Lithuania.One can also take history into account. We don't need to go further back than world war 2, to a time when Denmark and most of Europe and big parts of the world was invaded and controlled by Germany. How free and happy was Countries like Denmark at this time? Undeniably not very free or happy from what my grandparents tell me as they lived through this. Strongly armed and free countries like the US and Switzerland on the other hand, have remained uninvaded, free, happy and prosperous for hundreds of years!  So what about the freedom of choice. Denmark obviously has a VERY large government. Since so many here on this comment section are on the subject of healthcare, I would like to point out that the US has the highest quality healthcare in the entire world! The US has the lowest Hospital death rate in the world 15 out of the 30 best hospitals in the world are all in the US, and YES the health care is expensive in the US, because it's leading in medical innovation! Universal Health care suppresses the freedom of medical innovation, private \textbf{doctors} and hospitals etc. in EU. Good quality is not cheap, and most insurances and even medicare covers all prescription medicine and even such things as private physicians coming to your house is also "free" in the US. ¬†In the US you can choose from many hundreds of health care plans and you can even choose to have no health care plan at all and just pay the hospitals directly. In a country like Denmark, the health care IS controlled by the government, therefor a socialistic element. You get one mandatory healthcare plan, pretty much no choice or flexibility what so ever. Unless you're a millionaire and could afford a private insurance company in DK. But only royalties can afford that. That means it's dependent on the government and if the government is in bad shape the hospitals will be in bad shape. And back to the flexibility point, I'de like to take myself as an example. I've struggled my whole life with allergies, hay fever and rash etc. In spite of thousands of hospital visits, I've never received actual treatment for it because western medicine does not offer any cure for such internal illnesses. And even when I would do my own research and find my way to such things as immunotherapy, the \textbf{doctors} would deny me treatment, even though I had already paid for it through taxes. And I paid more than 65 taxes sometimes. Acupuncture is one of the few methods known to improve these conditions of mine, and of cause \textbf{nobody}, unless you are extremely rich, can afford both paying more than 50 taxes for healthcare (that denies you service), then afterwards pay for your private acupuncture treatment. It's not until I moved to the US I've been able to receive treatment. I pay the fee, the doctor performs the service, and now I can finally live a comfortable life. I never got an education in Denmark either, cause this is government controlled as well! The government offers you a set of educations you can choose from, and you already paid for it through coercion, so it's take it or leave it! The only education I was close to getting, was the mandatory military service. Pretty damn scary receiving a letter from the government commanding and ordering people to be at this place, at that time or they will send men with guns and lock ya in a cage! As a person who have lived in and traveled to several socialist countries, I personally find it carry to see elements of socialism like government controlled health care in our civilized countries cause it never turns out well, and many countries in Europe are in major trouble from embracing this. We should never entrust governments with so much responsibilities! And Denmark isn't even one of the bad countries in EU!As for your comment about Venezuela not being Democratic Socialism, but dictatorship. If you have all those fancy educations you claim to have, it's a little scary you would say something so incredibly uneducated! Is Dictatorship an ideology? NO, it's a form of government! How is it achieved? With socialism, or democratic socialism if you prefer. Venezuela is a socialistic country. The government controls the means of production. Socialism IS dictatorial as it dictates how people should think, behave, dress etc. Democratic Socialism is what they have in China. The Government Controls the means of production and they have a democratic system where the people can choose their leaders. You've clearly never been to the US! If you have, you must have stayed in a horrible state like Californistan, the battlefield of Chicago, or the SJW state of New York!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nobody, doctors & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/959 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.313 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@AL√âXANDROS Sorry to hear about your private problems, but also sorry to tell you that you are NOT the world, and NOT form a country. There are other people living in countries, that is why there is research, which result in facts. E.g for safety: Iceland is nr 1, Denmark 2, Austria 3, Finland 4, Singapore 5, New Zealand 6 and let me select some other countries: 12. Norway, 14 Netherlands, 16 Germany. USA IS ON PLACE 52, next to Cambodia and Equatorial \textbf{Guinea} and Gambia. The top safest countries are mainly European. SORRY FOR REALITY. According to the World Happiness Report (under guidance of the United Nations) the top 10 happiest countries are (period 2015-2017): 1) Finland; 2) Norway; 3) Denmark; 4) Iceland; 5) Switzerland; 6) Netherlands; 7) Canada; 8) New Zealand; 9) Sweden;10) Australia. USA again NOT in the top. SORRY FOR THE FACTS. Now you probably, as a trump supporter, will say that the facts are not correct, and the world is not round, but there are many different indicators from many different institutes and they more or less come, of course, to the same results. I lived in the Netherlands and the thing I loved most was biking. Total FREEDOM. Having to take the polluting car to nearly everywhere is a disaster, and not only because of environmental reasons (by the way if you want to talk about KILLING: climate change is the real killer, with now over 7.000.000 deaths per year (by the way also there the USA is BAD in the listing). My mother was a Christian, and hence we were not even allowed to play with plastic guns (you know Jesus his preaching)! As for Switzerland: Switzerland thus has a relatively high gun ownership rate. There are no official statistics, and estimates vary considerably. It is the ONLY developed and decent country, which allows guns. ALL others banned it, and hence the killing rate dropped spectacularly in ALL these banning countries. Australia being the last one. Why Switzerland did not become a Somalia or USA is a very very interesting question. If you want to do a PhD, it might be a real interesting topic. On the lists of countries per NET income Denmark is nr. 7 and the USA is nr. 5, but if you clean that for inequality (removing the Koch brothers, Gates, Zuckerberg etc), than of course the average Dane earns FAR more than the average American. IF you clean that, again, for per hour work, than the difference is shockingly in favour of Denmark, which works far less hours and has far more paid vacation days. Now of course a lot has also to do with the Dollar exchange rate. Anyhow....your PERSONAL feelings are important FOR YOU, but obviously do NOT reflect total reality. So sorry for having to wake you up. You might want to start looking for real facts, as the sources you get them from are clearly WRONG. If you base yourself on Fox State tv, I can imagine where the bias comes from. If you base yourself on trump, of course also: than use the following rule, with now nearly 30 (!) lies a day DOCUMENTED the best is to do the following: Trump says something, the truth and reality is NEARLY for sure the total opposite.

First of all, the general idea that you compare small individual EU countries to a huge superpower, where every single state is sovereign and has their own state government is absolutely laughable, and it once again proves you know squad about the US and that you've never lived here!OK here are some real stats and reality on safety, with sources!But first take note that many of the links I post are simply the broadcasters of the stats and are not the direct sources for these statistics.

And looking at a map, it's vividly clear Europe have more bombings, shootings and terror attacks in general. In fact if you compare 2015 and 2016 to the US, EU doesn't even look that much different from the Middle East.Source:  [LINK] "According to the World Happiness Report (under guidance of the United Nations)" - You can stop it right there! Happiness is not something that can be directly measured in numbers! Can you measure every happy person out of 100.000 people HAHAAH. NO! Stats work, indexes (as in happiness index) doesn't! Do you know what index means? It means an indicator, or sign of something.¬†But if we where to go with this wired index report, the US is ranked 15 which would be a very good score for such a large country. Some of the most unhappy AND happiest places in all 1st world countries, are in the US. Just imagine how happy people must be in some of the individual states to drive the number so high! But look realistically at this let me ask you something. If countries like Norway, Austria, Finland etc. are so happy and are so much more happy than the US combined, why do they have sky high depression rates? Source:  [LINK] Why do they all have sky high suicide rates compared to the US combined?Source:  [LINK] And why is Japan always ranked as one of the least depressed countries in the world, while they have the 10th highest suicide rate in the ENTIRE world?  And why are so many 2nd and 3rd world countries, where people are dying like flies, placed so high on the list? This link below should be enough proof why these Happiness indexes are clearly flawed, or don't work!Source:  [LINK] Here is some simple logic. If people are happy, they are not depressed and they certainly don't kill themselves in high numbers! AND No! I, am sorry to break the reality to YOU! You would have to be intoxicated or psychedelic to even for a split second, believe the realism and truthfulness of these happiness and safety indexes! Let me tell you this! Reality does not take place in the computer, or in the cellphone (that you wouldn't have if it wasn't for the US!) that you are writing this from! It happens out here in the real world. I've lived for several years with people from the Finland and Norway and Austria (Some of the countries with the highest happiness indexes) and Ive been to these countries myself! They where not the saddest people I've met, but they sure as hell weren't the happiest either! And ALL the most rude, miserable people I've ever met, came from nowhere other than EU, from Italy and Spain more precisely. The happiest place I've ever lived is here in Colorado. It's incredible that after a year and a half living here, not a SINGLE person has acted rude towards me, or seemed sad and depressed. People are overjoyed and blissful here, talkative, polite and I often catch people singing from happiness. And there are many states that are much happier than here! In a place like California I can't walk out one day without somebody being rude towards me, and in some countries in EU like Denmark, or even worse cases like Italy, Portugal or Spain, almost everybody with few exceptions, seem extremely depressed and sad, rude, obnoxious and even ruin the day for a lot of happy people they encounter.¬†"Having to take the polluting car to nearly everywhere is a disaster" - \textbf{Nobody} is "HAVING" to use a car! 50 feet from where I'm sitting right now there are at least 15 bikes parked, and people drive to work on them every day, even now in the winter, because the weather is so comfortable here with more than 300 days of sunshine a year. And oh year, how horrible it is to have the luxury owning a car so you can drive everywhere you want. Total freedom huh? Apparently you don't understand the word freedom either. One of the basic elements of the word freedom, is freedom from constraint in choices. Transporting oneself by bike constrains how far you can drive, thus constraint in freedom of travel! You know which countries statistically have the most pollution? The countries where people tend to drive more on bikes and scooters! Countries like China where only until quite recently everybody without exception drove on bikes. Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Egypt, UAE, Mongolia, India, Bahrain, Nepal, Ghana, Jordan, China, Senegal, Turkey, Bulgaria, Mauritius, Peru, Serbia, Iran etc. are the most polluted countries in the world and they are all among the countries with the least vehicles per capita!Source:  [LINK] Source:  [LINK] To be Continued....\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Nobody, Nothing, Old, alcohol & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Age - Youngsters, Behavioural Addiction - Alcohol & \cellcolor{green!27}5/1341 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.373 \\  \hline

US is "BAD" in this listing huh? they are on the top 20 least polluted countries in the world and states like Wyoming have the cleanest air in the world! Climate change is the "REAL" killer. HUH! First of all there is no way to prove that, and there is no way to prove if the climate wouldn't be changing if humans weren't here, as the climate has always been changing! Hard facts and actual death counts, DO exist on the other hand to prove how many have been killed as a direct result of Socialism. Billions of people have been killed from socialism and are being killed to this very day. In Socialist China alone, little children are killed by the hundreds of millions by the government or abducted and sold as \textbf{sex} slaves, or sold to pharmasutical organizations and hospitals where they are slaughtered and their vital organs sold to the highest bidder. In fact my wife from China, have lost several friends because of this and she has friends that have lost children and loved ones to it. I could never imagine what the total annual death toll would be, if all the numbers of dead could be compiled. Unfortunately anybody trying to do research on this in Socialist countries are often killed by the government. But if we look at democide, socialist and \textbf{communist} governments have from 1900 to 1999, disarmed and killed more than 262,000,000 civilians. Most professionals say it's far more though as most democides are kept secret. And if you include the soldiers killed, the number climbs way above 500,000,000 people. Source:  [LINK] Source:  [LINK] "As for Switzerland: Switzerland thus has a relatively high gun ownership rate. There are no official statistics, and estimates vary considerably." - Both right and wrong. More than 30 of the Swiss own either Fully or semi automatic military rifles. This is provable because they are registered! The reason why I say more, is because it wasn't required to register military style firearms until just recently, so there is a large percentage of non registered legally owned military firearms. And, the vast majority of firearms owned in Switzerland are "Hunting weapons". And they don't even require registration, so there is most likely much more than 50 firearms per 100 people! In fact, some estimate it to be as much as 60 per 100 people.Source:  [LINK] Source:  [LINK] "It is the ONLY developed and decent country, which allows guns" - If you are as educated as you claim to be, why is literally EVERY SINGLE sentence you write factually wrong? The countries where guns are completely banned are socialist countries like China, North Korea and Venezuela. You know which countries have the most gun ownership? They also happen to be the most developed countries with the highest living standards! Do you know that in the country where you live or used to lived, 45 out of 100 people own guns? Sweden, Norway, France, Austria, Canada, Germany, and Iceland all have more than 30 firearms per 100 people! So by your standards, you are literally telling me these are not developed or decent countries! I thought you liked Europe! So you consider 2nd and 3rd world countries developed and decent countries? And I own guns in DK, is Denmark not considered a developed country either? "ALL others banned it, and hence the killing rate dropped spectacularly in ALL these banning countries. Australia being the last one." - Ohh Bless you're heart! Generally speaking most EU countries have been implementing more and more gun control and most EU countries have seen dramatic increases in assault, threats, robbery, harassment, and especially \textbf{sex} crimes in the past couple decades! Source:  [LINK] Source:  [LINK] Source:  [LINK] In all cases where guns have been banned, all statistics show murder and crime rates double and even triple! 5 to 10 years after the ban they tend to decrease, and drop down to the exact same numbers right before the ban.

Now, Australias crime rate has fallen in the last years, but their gun-ownership rate rate has increased to 5 times that of before the ban! After the ban, gun murders specifically where reduced, but knife crimes went up at the exact rate the gun crimes went down. Murderers kept killing, they just switched to another tool, and off cause citizens where left defenseless. Australias murder and overall crime rate has continuously and steadily been reducing decade after decade in Australia, and the only time a drastic increase was observed was immediately after the ban!Source:  [LINK] Do you seriously support the government busting into law-abiding, taxpaying peoples house and taking their guns! If you do, you are an absolute authoritarian and your views in guns are no different than those of dictators like Hitler, Mao, Stalin, Mussolini etc. They all disarmed their citizens before enslaving their own people. An unarmed population is a weak, enslaved population easy to control, and gun free zones are invitations to criminals. It's estimated that 98 of all mass murders happen in gun free Zones? Banning guns also increases the \textbf{black} gun market. In Denmark, which has extreme tight gun control, I have friends who bought guns, and even sold guns, on the \textbf{black} market as early as 15 years of \textbf{age}.Source:  [LINK] Are you aware that US states like Utah, Wyoming, South Dakota, North Dakota, Montana, Vermont, New Hampshire, Main etc. all are among the states with either the highest gun ownership rates or states with the most lax gun laws and are also among the US states, and on the world stage, among the places with the lowest murder rates in the world! All rated below 3 per 100.000 and some even below 1, only trumped by few countries in EU.Do you have any idea how many are saved by guns in the US? FBI has estimated that every year 500,000 to more than 2.5 million times per year guns are used by civilians to save someones life in the US. Now contrast that to the 5,100 annual gun murders in the US. And only 260 people are killed by civilians in the US every year. That means the overwhelmingly majority of the times, guns are used by civilians to either deter or arrest someone, not to kill! The US has more firearms now than ever, and crime rates have decreased by 48 and all the way up to 74, and overall crime is supposed to be down by 62 since the early 90s.Source:  [LINK] Source:  [LINK] Source:  [LINK] Source:  [LINK] Source:  [LINK] To be continued....\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Black, Communist, Sex & \cellcolor{green!5} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Age - General, Ethnicity - Black, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}6/1260 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.476 \\  \hline

IF you clean that, again, for per hour work, than the difference is shockingly in favour of Denmark, which works far less hours and has far more paid vacation days" - Is that why Americans are able to live in houses twice the size of the average EU sized house, and on the side of that own large pieces of land? And is that why Americans are often able to own several cars, that also tend to be far bigger than the average sized EU car. \textbf{Nobody} that I know in Denmark, family or friends, have ever gotten a paid vacation! The Income in Denmark is not worth much, when you pay more than 50 percent income taxes, more than 25 VAT/MOMS, 300 for electricity etc. etc. and a million taxes hidden in the system that most people don't even know about! More importantly, I've estimated that everything on average cost 3 times the price in Denmark compared to US prices. There is a reason why 50 percent of Danes try to buy most things from overseas. A few random examples. A shitty Wolkswagen Golf R, cost more than 600.000 KR, and a Volkswagen Touareg, is more than a million KR. That's the same as what you pay for a brand new hand made 2018 Aston Martin (price is around \$ 250.000, or 1.25 million KR) or several 2019 Jaguar XJ price is only \$72,272! For contrast, the same 2018 Aston Martin model cost around \$1 million or 5.782.642 kr in DK. And the Jaguar XJ in DK is \$1.5 million or around \$280.000.  I bought a Remington 870 express super magnum shotgun in DK. Good \textbf{old} make and model. Price in the US is 380\$ (2300 KR). In Denmark I paid 1310.24 US Dollar 8000 (KR) for the damn thing! A gallon of organic whole milk is 50 higher price in Denmark compared with the US!I live in a rather cheap apartment in the US. It's mainly low income people that live here, but many of the people that live in the building own two different cars and drive big luxurious SUVs or Chryslers. Many rich people in Denmark can't afford those cars. And it's not uncommon for Americans to own several houses. And the houses in the US are much larger and more luxurious than that of DK. Average size of houses built in the US is 2,700 square feet. Compare this to EU countries:Denmark: 1,475sf France: 1,216sf Spain: 1,044sfIreland: 947sfUK: 818sfSource:  [LINK] Source:  [LINK] But let's look at some actual statistics, of how much more money Americans really have compared to other countries. I know you like that, or maybe not?Studies from Forbes show that the poorest bottom 10 of the US earn more than the bottom 10 of Sweden, Australia, Britain, Germany, Poland, Japan, France, Italy etc. In fact the only country where the poor are doing a little tiny bit better, is in Canada. And this is of course just when you look at the US as a whole (which logically isn't fair). When you compare individual states, you will find even better rates, but obviously also worse rates from certain states. And the top 10 are doing far better in the US than in any other country from this survey, which is because of Capitalism that allow business, trade and manufacturing to thrive and allows the US to have the highest GDP in the world, and this in the end allows for overall better treatment and better options to the bottom 10.Source:  [LINK] If you wanna talk about a country that's got Economic inequalities then let's look at Denmark.In the US, you will receive the same salary no matter what your skin tone! In Denmark, if you are from the Middle East or from Poland you are only entitled to half the salary of caucasians! Not by decision of your employer but by national law. Which is why it's almost impossible for caucasians, like me, to get a job there, cause employers only want to hire foreigners! I worked in a glass house when I was 18. And when one turns 18, you must by law receive twice your current salary. Employer can't afford that, so you get fired. But all the foreigners they stayed behind of cause. Is that equality?

If it was run by the state, they would undoubtedly be a left wing News Network station! Fox News is a United States pay television news channel owned by the Fox Entertainment Group.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Geert Termeer  - "Having guns does NOT protect you against invasions. That Japanese opinion must be totally nonsense, as Japan  invaded country after country, island after island." - Japan prepared for a long war. However, they did hold out hope that a decisive victory at Pearl Harbor would lead to a quick resolution. Yamamoto, in particular, was pessimistic about Japan's ability to fight a protracted war with the U.S. and hoped for a quick peace. Years after the war, US Commander Menard and Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto sat down as allies and conversed. Someone at the table asked the Japanese admiral "Why, with the Pacific Fleet devastated at Pearl Harbor and the mainland U.S. forces in what Japan HAD to know was a pathetic state of unreadiness, Japan had not simply invaded the West Coast". Commander Menard would never forget the crafty look on the Japanese commander's face as he frankly answered the question. '"You are right'' he told the Americans. ''We did indeed know much about your preparedness. We knew that probably every second home in your country contained firearms. We knew that your country actually had state championships for private citizens shooting military rifles. We were not fools to set foot in such quicksand.'' Switzerland and the US are the most armed countries on earth, and they are among the only countries, with the only exception of Sweden (which surprisingly also has a lot of guns), that hasn't been invaded or had tyrannical governments! That in itself is proof enough! And the point of an armed population is really not actually to actively fight back, it is to simply be there as a deterrent. That is why Switzerland purposely arm their citizens, and why the US has the 2 amendment in the first place!"Many of them with citizens with guns. In those days Americans did not have so much guns, compared to e.g. the countries invaded by the Japanese." - Are you kidding me! The Americans invented the gun! And back to the time you are talking about which is 70 years ago (as that's the last time they invaded China) the total amount of Firearms in the US was less, but there where actually more guns per 100 capita back then, ergo more gun owners in the US! And almost all Asian countries at that time, where dictatorial regimes that prohibited firearms and they still do to this day. As a man who's lived in China, I can tell you China has almost always been a shit-hole! The ONLY time China was a decent civilized country to live in, was under Sun Yat-Sen during Xinhai Revolution, and surprise, it is also the only time where China allowed its citizens to own firearms. You see Sun Yat-sen copied the capitalist idea of the US. Then Mao came, disarmed the populous, and mass-murdered more than 50 million people. Don't be ignorant, there is a reason why EVERY single dictator disarms the people before they take over, and it's happened as recently as in Venezuela!"I understand you want to shoot guns at cluster bombs and tanks." - Yet another Straw man argument! Where did I say that? "(by the way also your Switzerland was invaded by the Germans, I think even in several days?)" - Proof? Swiss neutrality was an armed neutrality. The Swiss haven't been involved in any wars since 1847, and they are famous for having had no invasions or tyrannical government for more than 600 years.  [LINK] "Can you please state the SOURCES of your facts, as it seems you make up your own facts. That is NOT how it works. We are NOT working on trump logic, but on reality" - The Very reason why the country is doing so well under trump is because we have a leader with a good sense of logic, living in reality and not a textbook life like most politicians. Most politicians have never done an honest job in their life or created one single job. Trump on the other hand has created thousands in his own business and millions during his presidency. And you've clearly never watched any of his speeches as most of what he talks about during them are facts and statistics. I didn't list any sources in my previous text as it takes many many hours to pull them up, and they are tenths of thousands of hours worth of reading material and I honestly didn't expect anybody would be interested in spending hours reading it. Now I've listed at least a dozen of sources, and I still doubt you or anybody will really take the time to read all of that.There are both good and bad countries in EU as there are good and bad states in the US. For you to sit there behind your screen and act knowledgeable and intellectual, demonizing the US in such a generalizing manner, from basically a piece of paper is as naive as it gets!¬†You therefor clearly don't understand how the US works, but let me enlighten you and shed some light on the topic of US state sovereignty! The Tenth Amendment expresses the principle of federalism and states' rights, which strictly supports the entire plan of the original Constitution for the United States of America, by stating that the federal government possesses only those powers delegated to it by the United States Constitution. All remaining powers are reserved for the states or the people. This is why every US state is almost as different from each other, as the different countries in Europe. Every state is unique in its own way. They have their own governments, laws, culture, nature, accents, climate etc. Hence, the statistics you have presented, are profoundly generalized. When digging into those crude stats of yours, which only reveals the median numbers of the US, you'll find many negative numbers, but you'll also find much better numbers!And without you having even lived in the US, you are in no way entitled to do so. What I derive from what you've written, is that you've spend most of your life in School in study, and you said you did it because you enjoy it. I don't know how \textbf{old} you are, but judging from what you've written and all the miscomprehension and fallacies you've stated about the land of the free, it sounds like you're living your life in a textbook! Quite like all the dictators do, spending their lives reading about how beautiful Socialism and Communism sounds, but having no clue about how it functions in real life. Now I'm not insinuating you are a dictator, haha, or in the slightest way resemble one, of course not! I Imagine you are a very kind young student, and being that you are from Finland, that's highly likely! But I hope you recognize how ignorant these comparisons of yours was, and acknowledge that you can't judge a country of 50 sovereign states from a piece of paper, that only contains generalized statistics.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}1/1170 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.085 \\  \hline

Once again, the US is among the 20 least polluted countries on the planet! And that's totally amazing when considering the US is one of the two countries with most production! You know I used to do the exact same thing your doing right now! I've been listening to politicians and scientist predicting the end of civilization for 10 years. They predict the end of the world every single year. If we go back to the 2008 estimates, we're not even supposed to be here right now! I used to warn my family about solar storms, and the poles melting. They keep telling us it's getting hotter, yet every year we also get colder winters. The climate is always changing, and it'll keep changing regardless if us humans are here or not. Remember during the last Ice \textbf{age}, when large parts of the planet was almost uninhabitable, homo sapiens (modern humans) and homo neanderthalensis (neanderthals) where still living in caves, but that dramatic climate change still happened. I'm not a denier of climate change! But if you choose to live your life like this, with your tail tucked up between your legs, you'll live a sad paranoid life! Trump has done the only right thing for the climate and nature in the US! Which is to give back thousands of thousands of acres of government stolen nature back to the people, so the government and some politicians in a suit thousands of miles away can't destroy it. How much land collectively belongs to the people in European countries? Not much, if any at all, and most of EU is completely urbanized, and the vast majority of European countries are among the must cultivated lands in the world.  [LINK]  [LINK] "the USA is plummeting with trump" - Again, denying the facts I've already stated. In fact statistically the US is pretty much the only country seeing economic improvement at the moment."am in Bulgaria now...good food, very very cheap country, with a nice coast line." - OK, I've lost all faith with you at this point. You are either just scamming now, or otherwise you are one of the biggest hypocrites on earth! You sit there, behind your device which was invented in the US, and bash and demonize the US with biased generalized nonsensical stats without ever even having set foot in this country, you complain about murder rates in the US, you complain about pollution in the US, you complain about safety in the US etc. and you do this from freaking BULGARIA? A country rated to be the 16th most polluted country on earth, a country that until 1989 was a \textbf{Communist} dictatorship. Which brings up yet another dictator coming out of Europe. Todor Hristov Zhivkov who was the \textbf{communist} leader of the People's Republic of Bulgaria. I really wonder how many dictators Europe has had at this point!Good food and a Nice cost line Huh? Air pollution from industrial emissions, rivers polluted from raw sewage, heavy metals, detergents; deforestation or forest damage from air pollution and resulting acid rain, soil contamination from heavy metals from metallurgical plants and industrial wastes. Yes I'm sure they have a nice cost line when you ignore the facts. I would advise you to be careful about what you ingest. I've had more sick days than I can count from eating the dirty food in China, which has a pollution rate almost equal to Bulgaria!

[LINK] My grand parent lived In Denmark when Denmark was occupied as well."Because that sounds like bullshit and you do realize that it was the demonization of minorities that made the holocaust one of the greatest evils out there, right?" - Social Justice is exactly what causes demonization of minorities! Social justice is a socialist term used by fascists. It was in fact promoted by German fascists and it refers to justice having to be applied to collectivist groups. So one could be adjudicated guilty by ones identity and punished accordingly because everything some jews did was because they were jewish. If one banker is corrupt all banking is corrupt and every banker should be made to pay. And being punished for ones identity and viewpoints, is undeniably what's happening in many European countries, where thousands of people are punished or jailed for the practice of free speech! As an example, in the UK, it's estimated that 12 people a day are arrested for saying something the government doesn't like. [LINK]  [LINK] It's horrifying that cases such as what's happening with Tommy Robinson, is just one of 12 every day in the UK alone!‚ÄãTheThought2be and anybody that sees this reply, If you aren't informed on the Tommy Robinson case, I urge you to look it up, so you can see how countries like the UK treats it's citizens when they arrest them for speech! Go to 7.40 in the video below where Tommy starts talking about his latest prison visit (most of it spend in solitary), for saying something the government didn't like.  [LINK]   Or watch this video for the short version. [LINK] If you've watched this video, remember, Tommy is statistically just 1 out of 12 people every day having to deal with this, in this case in the UK!Social justice is a term not considered by people on the right apart from Freidman, and the only time he spoke of the term, he dismissed it as dangerous because it led to individuals, who were innocent, being punished for the viewpoints of an entire group. Thus a group could be dehumanized to the point the state could slaughter them in the twisted notion, that the state was protecting mankind. Social Justice was the justification for genocide by fascists and communists."It had \textbf{nothing} to do with education." - Is that a joke? The Education was a major tool by which the Nazis' racial policies were promoted and implemented. The Schools where government controlled and it was made free. It was, as Kitty Werthmann put it, "nationalized" which the direct definition of is: Transfer (a major branch of industry or commerce) from private to state ownership or control. Which is exactly what I said! [LINK] It's true the Nazis had health care. They inherited the tradition from Bismarck, who set up the first national health system in the world (after unifying Germany in 1871).But there was a difference between \textbf{Nazi} health care and the systems under the German Empire and the Weimar Republic. Hitler rearranged the system under a strict regime of central government control, so all insurance-scheme managers reported straight to Berlin. Later ‚Äî and not through the insurance companies  [LINK] Isn't this logical? Dictators always promise free stuff in order to brainwash the populous. In order for a government to become dictatorial and control a population, it's certainly not done by removing power and control and decentralizing the government! In fact, I can as a foreigner go right now and get free University education in China. Sounds nice right, problem is they will brainwash you. I was told this when I lived and worked in China!

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Tabby Reed  There is no Palestine \textbf{nation}. Palestine was a British territory. In 1948 a treaty was signed that would have formed the nations of both Israel and Palestine. The Palestinians refused to sign the treaty and instead declared war on newly formed Israel. Israel defeated them and annexed the unclaimed land. Had the Palestinians simply signed the treaty then they would have had a \textbf{nation}. But they didn't. This means that Israel has the legal right to exist. Now while you seem to be aware of the Christian prophecy, you seem to be unaware that the Qur'an (chapter 17:100 - 104) states that Israel is the land of the Israelites and that they are to dwell safely there until the Islamic End of Days. Which means it is actually anti-Islamic to claim that the territory belongs to the Palestinians. For taking the land away from the Israelites would mean that Allah did not fulfill His promise to the Israelites.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nation & \cellcolor{green!5}Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/160 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.25 \\  \hline

Israel is the country that is the embodiment and representation of the Jewish people worldwide and while criticism of Israel is not inherently anti-Semitic opposition to it in most cases is. The anti-Israel stances typically promote policies that threaten Israel's national security and could result in it's destruction. A comparison might be that if someone were to harbor anti-Italian sentiments against the \textbf{nation} of Italy, and call for policies that jeopardize Italians could that person then claim to be a friend of Italians?Make no mistake, sentiments that are anti-Israel are in a lot of cases \textbf{thin} veils for closeted anti-Semitism, and there is no shortage of such hatred it merely comes in several forms.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nation, Thin & \cellcolor{green!5}Nationality - General, Physical Identity - Physical Features & \cellcolor{green!5}2/130 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.538 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@alanguages How can you call her anti-Semitic? She is likely more Semitic than Netenyahu. The bible says the devil will deceive the world. First of all Semitic is not a group of people it is a family of languages indigenous to Africa. Aramaic, Arabic, Hebrew, Amharic, Tegri, and about 400 others spoken Africa.The Zionists rule our country and have infiltrated the Christian Church. Any bible scholar knows the Jews are descendants from the European Kazarian Kingdom. In 740 AD they converted to Judaism under King Bulan. For hundreds of years they ruled a region between the Caspian and \textbf{Black} Sea. They converted to Judaism the same way Donald Trump's daughter did. These imposters have no genetic, historical, or archeological connections to the Biblical Hebrews. The Christian church remains silent because if these European imposters are exposed; then people will ask who and where are the Hebrew Israelites.First of all they would look like Rep. Omar. The biblical Hebrews were Negros. Israel is in Africa despite attempts to redefine it as the middle east. Moses was raised as Pharaohs Grandson and all the Pharaoh's of that era were Negros. Pharaoh had order the murder of all Hebrew baby boys of Moses \textbf{age}. Their was no physical differences between Hebrews, Egyptian, and Ethiopian people. When Moses true identity was discovered he fled into the wilderness. While resting at the well he helped the Shepard girls water their flock. When they return home early their father ask them, " how is it you are back home so soon". They answered an Egyptian helped us. They thought he was Egyptian because Moses fled with the clothes on his back. He was still wearing Egyptian clothes. Moses married an Ethiopian \textbf{woman}. King Salomon and Sheba first born son Maliki became the first King of Ethiopia. European were desperate to white wash history. For this lie to work they had to make the Egyptians and the Israelites white. This served the Kazarian European Jews and the Christian church. In many European countries that were not invested in the exploitation of Africa and it's people; you find \textbf{Black} Madonna and Messiah.The Catholic Church decided to change the image of the Messiah. Pope Alexander VI commission a new European image of the Messiah. It was a big deal so a heated competition between DaVinci and Michelangelo ended with DaVinci winning the contract because he was rumored to be the lover of the Pope's son Cesare Borgia. The image of the Christ that is on a billion pictures is the \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} son of Pope Alexander. Why would the Hebrew people ever go to Europe. When threatened they always fled to Egypt and when Jerusalem was destroyed by the Romans they fled in to south and west Africa where you can find the tribes today. These Africans pass the Genetic test and they still follow Hebrew traditions. The very first maps of Africa commissioned by European Kings shows a section of West Africa called the Kingdom of Judah. Now this is where the story gets interesting. When the slave trade started we are told other \textbf{African} sold other \textbf{African} tribes into slavery. The truth that will shatter all we know today is the first slaves brought to the Western Hemisphere were the tribe of Judah. Yes, the hated blacks of the America's are directly decendant of the tribe of Judah.The imposter Netenyahu stood before Congress claming Moses led his people, but Moses never went to Poland. Netenyahu whose real name was Millenkosky before his father changed it to sound Hebrew.Some say they are our allies. I need only point out how they have spied on us for decades and then sold those secrets to our strategic enemies. Russia received the bulk of these secrets in exchange for allowing more Jews to immigrate to Israel.During the Iraq war they were caught trying to steal secrets about our troop placements in Iraq. Intending to assist insurgents kill American troops. Even more dramatic was the 1967 attack on the USS LIBERTY. They made every attempt to sink this ship and blame it on the Egyptians during the Arab Israeli war. The ship was clearly American and many sailors lost their lives as the Israeli Airforce and Navy mercilessly killed many American sailors.If you are an American patriot you can not stand by and let this foreign power use us for their evil goals.Jerrod Kushner is a traitor and he is setting us up for conflict with every country around Israel. Iraq, Libya, Iran, Syria must be destroyed and they used ISIS and American to do it. ISIS has attacked Christians and MUSLIMS; but never Israel and no one seems to think something is strange about this \textbf{terrorist} organization never throwing even one pebble at Israel but swear war on everyone else.If you are a Christian please realize they use your love of Jesus to manipulate American politics.Also realize Jesus was not the Messiah name and the bible clearly predicted this great identity theft.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small You may not know this yet but it is the JUDEO-CHRISTIAN ETHIC that unites ALL good Americans. Many, many atheists have laid down their lives to protect it. In fact, many of the best defenders of the Christ mission have no interest in participating in the Christian faith. Certainly the holocaust survivors and their descendants continue to defend the ethic. Read on to understand the great principle that has made the United States of America exceptional above all others:        While a \textbf{nation} that separates church and state can function, a \textbf{nation} that rejects basic Judeo-Christian principles is destined to devolve into \textbf{banana} republicanism. There certainly were deists among our Christian forefathers but they too embraced biblical morality because they understood it to be the highest of human aspirations.These are the 'Christian' principles that made this \textbf{nation} 'exceptional', protected us from corruptive practices and gave us the hope of LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL for many generations. You would do well to know and value them: Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment:  THOU SHALT NOT RESPECT THE PERSON OF THE POOR, nor honour the person of the mighty: but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour. Leviticus 19:15 Ye shall have ONE MANNER OF LAW, as well for the stranger, as for one of your own country: for I am the LORD your God. Leviticus 24:22 The end of our republic must begin with the fracturing of its SOCIAL CONTRACT, the ONE LAW for ALL unifying principle. Why is that? Because when the laws become skewed to place the most amoral, the least talented and the least trustworthy personalities ahead of the more deserving the problem is that these people are simply not equipped to preserve the system of equality that better men and women fought, bled and died to give us.A system of MERITOCRACY is the hallmark of a functioning republic.  Ours was intended to be a \textbf{nation} grounded in the vision of EQUAL OPPORTUNITY for EVERY CITIZEN. Of course, we have been an admittedly unperfected work in progress for generations but, nevertheless, this vision has been humanity's greatest pride. Today it is being threatened with the secular vision of MATERIAL equity for all regardless of social contribution. This is the first step towards the return to a Dark \textbf{Age} tyranny that limits the hope of individual aspiration and allows the marginal access to positions of authority. Remember this, human glory has always been the gift of a very talented few forging the way for the masses to benefit. There is \textbf{nothing} wrong with hierarchy as long as each and every human being has the right to express themselves to their fullest potential, that is, until and unless they prevent their neighbor from doing so as well. For this very reason we must have the Judeo-Christian principles in place to protect every one of us. What we are experiencing today, however, is that an elitist few are demanding the controlled leveling of both mind and speech from the many that they perceive to be beneath them. A situation has been purposefully contrived in which the most morally insightful individuals in our \textbf{nation} are being routinely shouted down by self-pitying, arrogantly amoral masses that are undeservedly attempting to perpetrate a national theft against these well-intentioned people. The forefathers established this \textbf{nation} as a republic to prevent this very situation which they rightly described as 'tyranny of the masses'. The ONLY THING that will save what is left of our republic is the return to the Judeo-Christian principles outlined above. However, don't worry, in a \textbf{nation} grounded upon these principles you can still choose to live out your secularism in total peace. While the Islamic god, Allah, demands 'submission' from all of humanity, Judeo-Christianity at its core is about the struggle to preserve the conditions of freedom that allow each man and \textbf{woman} to CHOOSE THEIR OWN DESTINY.
