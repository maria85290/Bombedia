The \textbf{age} of Aquarius, but good luck finding that on Google LOL. We read Fahrenheit 451 in middle school and now are living in the pre stages of that reality. Where thoughts are policed and truth is twisted to enforce the censorship of anything not state-produced or approved. I have been archiving historical texts and data for years now, ever since my \textbf{senior} year in High School. No bias to the historical texts or data, as I scrape sources from any database, library and niche shop that I can possibly find. I recommend we all become students of history, because it repeats. The most similar history I have found is Roman history and Babylonian history (when compared to the US, Russia and China). Fun fact: on the battlefields of the many Macedonian conquests on Persia, thousands of animals were sacrificed in mere months to win favor with the gods and goddesses. Imagine being in a Persian battle cavalry and seeing high priests slaughtering animals one after the other directly behind the enemy's battle line. To them it was probably \textbf{nothing}, but to us living in the current era it sounds insane. Maybe one day the future will look upon us in the same sense in the way we treat one another and the views we share with each other. I think my response was directed towards the statement that should Europeans live in the US. To that, I say that it should not be based strictly on moving here just to change the culture into European cultures. We have diversity in history to show what works, and what fails. Every system of power finds itself corrupted and failing, it just might take one longer to fail than the others. We can learn from this and implement  several key ideals from each long lasting system and create a better system, but people are so divided today that the only possible course of action would be outright force of power. Diplomacy died a long time ago. Now the only action that gets enacted by 'diplomacy' is with the threat of violence or threatening their economy. All love to everyone, I just dont want people to buy into a propaganda tool that we used on the USSR to collapse their power structure. Best wishes <3 PS I love intellectual conversations and absolutely admire different viewpoints. So a reply with your ideals would be greatly appreciated and respected. I just don't stand for blaming someone for something in history that they never had to deal with or has passed. I guess my message here was to remain privy to history but don't assume that someone now is the same as a person/group in history.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Nothing, Senior, Weird & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Age - Youngsters, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}4/510 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.784 \\  \hline
