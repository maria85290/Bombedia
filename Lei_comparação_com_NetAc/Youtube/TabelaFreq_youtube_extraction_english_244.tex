  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Oh my gosh I can't believe I have to do a third comment but to clarify to those who didn't understand the reason the older man stepped up to the \textbf{black} guy was a scenario that is circumstantial depending on the situation or the person may be in his personality he felt bold or maybe it's the fact that there was at least five other people with him so that if the \textbf{black} guy tried anything on the \textbf{old} man he at least had reinforcements who would likely back him up in that situation I'm just trying to make things clear here that this scenario is not something you can just blame on \textbf{race} it's too specific and from situation to situation\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Old, Race & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}4/122 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.279 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Let me add a second comment and say that that first girl was smart you don't want to be Superman especially against another male \textbf{race} does it matter at this point because I know cambodians Hispanics and white boys who will all kill under certain circumstances especially thieves if they are desperate enough to steal that little petty money then you don't know what the desperate of in another scenario I think the \textbf{old} man handle it the best approach them then tell them you'll pay for them\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Old, Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/88 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.273 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The first brother was smart a \textbf{black} man's word versus a white woman's word in most scenarios doesn't often have a good result historically speaking in statistically in addition to this you don't want to be the Superman against a criminal or a thief or anyone of that sort especially when it's not your restaurant or not your place it would be a good gesture to let them know ahead of time but for my experience it's not really the best to stick out from the crowd in these situations not unless you have a group of people calling them out with you\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!27}1/103 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.971 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small playkandle It's \textbf{crazy} how quickly you jump to conclusions. You look at prisoner population by races and assume that it means that individuals of said races are more like to be violent but what's funny is when you look at poverty rates by races. Poverty rate among white people is 8.7, among \textbf{black} people 21.2, among hispanic people 18.3. A direct link has been shown between poverty and theft/robberies so what does this mean? That statistically speaking more people of those races are likely to rob/steal than white people and thus are more likely to serve time. Also the imprisonment rate of \textbf{African} Americans for drug charges is almost 6 times that of whites. Funny enough \textbf{African} Americans represent 12.5 of illicit drug users, but 29 of those arrested for drug offenses and 33 of those incarcerated in state facilities for drug offenses which greatly increases the penitentiary population of \textbf{black} people.A criminal record can reduce the likelihood of a callback or job offer by nearly 50 percent. The negative impact of a criminal record is twice as large for \textbf{African} American applicants which can then lead to poverty so a return in criminality such as more theft/robberies etc...and you can look at plenty other things like that so what can we conclude? That the rate incarcerations you've given don't prove in any way shape or form that individual of those races are more likely to be violent criminals than white people, only that they have different circumstances.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}African, Black, Crazy & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}6/249 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.41 \\  \hline

It's a closely guarded secret among feminists that they benefit the most from affirmative action, they have the least likelihood of incarceration even as repeat offenders, they earn the lightest sentences for the same crimes, and when victimized their perpetrators receive the harshest sentences.

Why else would so many of them feel so emboldened to call 911 on genuinely marginalized peoples for everything from delivering newspapers to cutting grass to trying to enter one's own apartment complex?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Јебем ти живот Lol, you don't have a clue how "privilege" works.White privilege doesn't mean every single white person gets the upper hand in EVERY aspect of their life. It also doesn't mean just because of "white privilege" minority groups can never achieve the same success as of white people. It means, from getting A to B in life, some groups face more struggles and challenges than whites which can make it longer for them to achieve their true potential in many aspects of life.Ask Satya Nadela, and he'll tell you the subtle discrimination he would still face being in the industry. Obama, even after becoming president, has claimed he continued to face discrimination in white house. Did white privilege stop him from becoming president? No. But Did his privilege of being "the president" shield him from any discrimination? No. The problem is that when you talk about white privilege you're talking only about economic benefits but in reality, it's more about social benefits and how it overlaps with many other categories like , class, \textbf{gender}, "\textbf{Race}", ability etc.You speak only from a "economic advantage" perspective but it's moreso about social advantages and how many other subcategories are intertwined with each other that keeps them poor.1) White people are less likely to be followed, interrogated or searched by law enforcement because they look 'suspicious.' 2) White people's skin tone will not be a reason people hesitate to trust their credit or financial responsibility.3) If white people are accused of a crime, they are less likely to be presumed guilty, less likely to be sentenced to death and more likely to be portrayed in a fair, nuanced manner by media outlets (see the IfTheyGunnedMeDown campaign). 4) The personal faults or missteps of white people will likely not be used to later deny opportunities or compassion to people who share their racial identity.Here's the experience of a white police officer who has been in the department for 12 years has to say:"I served as an police officer and a detective for more than 12 years, and I have felt a particular connection to the the tragic events of recent weeks. There is clearly a massive gap between \textbf{black} Americans and the police departments that are supposed to serve them.As a white American, I do not know what it's like to be three times more likely to be suspended in school because of my skin colour, or to stand out in a crowd as a minority because of my skin colour. I do not know what it's like to be twice as unlikely than other Americans on average to get a job I apply for because of my skin colour.I also don't know what it's like to be significantly more likely to be arrested than people of other racial groups, or to be three times more likely than average to be killed by the police because of my skin colour. I don't know what it feels like to know that if found guilty of a crime, I could be given a 20 longer prison sentence based on the colour of my skin.This is, of course, the reality for 13 of the US's population – the \textbf{black} population.Yet I do know something about the strained relationship between \textbf{black} communities and American police officers, and I know it firsthand.I know what it's like when a community you serve declines to co-operate with you during a criminal investigation because of the uniform you wear. I know what it's like to try your hardest to earn the trust of (understandably) untrusting communities to only see another member of the police community murder a \textbf{black} teen on national news."\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Gender, Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}6/623 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.963 \\  \hline

Beccause socioeconomic factors are indeed intertwined with "\textbf{race}". It is actually rooted back in the days of segregation. When it was legal to segregate neighborhoods, real estate would divide them up. You had a \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} line, and a green line. The green line held the nice homes in good neighborhoods. \textbf{R\textbf{ed}} line was pretty much the ghettos. It was very difficult, sometimes impossible for a \textbf{black} family to move into the green line, no matter how much money they had. This put many \textbf{black} families at a disadvantage even today. Because while the ancestors of white citizens were able to buy, sell, and move up in wealth in the green line, thus setting their descendants up for a comfortable living, the ancestors of blacks struggled, and had very little to offer their descendants."The reason poor \textbf{black} children are more likely to attend underfunded schools is the result of the legacy of segregation, redlining and government policy" [LINK] 1) "\textbf{Black} children born to wealthy \textbf{black} parents have a lower chance at economic success than white children born to poor parents. \textbf{Black} students are punished more harshly than white students who commit the same offenses. \textbf{Black} workers with the same education and experience are paid less"2) "White and Asian scholars aren't being sent to the educational sidelines or being forced to pursue careers in bricklaying and pipe-welding. Every single top-tier educational institution in America is disproportionately white and Asian. White and Asian wages are higher than the wages of blacks and Hispanics with the same education and experience. White people are disproportionately represented in government.

They will likely earn less money than white kids who grew up in worse neighborhoods. They will probably earn less than white boys from poorer families. They will be locked out from every access point to the American dream, and the data proves it.Professor Ibram Kendi, director of the Antiracist Research and Policy Center at American University, told the Times, 'One of the most popular liberal post-racial ideas is the idea that the fundamental problem is class and not \textbf{race}, and clearly this study explodes that idea.' Kendi added, 'But for whatever reason, we're unwilling to stare \textbf{racism} in the face.'"

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@John Barnwell There's plenty of evidence if you just open your eyes to the world around you. Just a random Google search can give you enough studies on it, since you're too lazy and stupid to do it yourself, here goes:You speak only from an "economic advantage" perspective but it's moreso about social advantages and how many other subcategories are intertwined with each other that keeps them poor.1) White people are less likely to be followed, interrogated or searched by law enforcement because they look 'suspicious.' 2) White people's skin tone will not be a reason people hesitate to trust their credit or financial responsibility.3) If white people are accused of a crime, they are less likely to be presumed guilty, less likely to be sentenced to death and more likely to be portrayed in a fair, nuanced manner by media outlets (see the IfTheyGunnedMeDown campaign). 4) The personal faults or missteps of white people will likely not be used to later deny opportunities or compassion to people who share their racial identity.Here's the experience of a white police officer who has been in the department for 12 years has to say:"I served as an police officer and a detective for more than 12 years, and I have felt a particular connection to the the tragic events of recent weeks. There is clearly a massive gap between \textbf{black} Americans and the police departments that are supposed to serve them.As a white American, I do not know what it's like to be three times more likely to be suspended in school because of my skin colour, or to stand out in a crowd as a minority because of my skin colour. I do not know what it's like to be twice as unlikely than other Americans on average to get a job I apply for because of my skin colour.I also don't know what it's like to be significantly more likely to be arrested than people of other racial groups, or to be three times more likely than average to be killed by the police because of my skin colour. I don't know what it feels like to know that if found guilty of a crime, I could be given a 20 longer prison sentence based on the colour of my skin.This is, of course, the reality for 13 of the US's population – the \textbf{black} population.Yet I do know something about the strained relationship between \textbf{black} communities and American police officers, and I know it firsthand.I know what it's like when a community you serve declines to co-operate with you during a criminal investigation because of the uniform you wear. I know what it's like to try your hardest to earn the trust of (understandably) untrusting communities to only see another member of the police community murder a \textbf{black} teen on national news."Do you want more studies?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@John Barnwell Yeah cherry pick a biased site when there's many other peer reviewed studies validating it's existsHere's an actual large scale study conducted by a university."Some people question whether white Americans, particularly those who are economically disadvantaged, enjoy any sort of privilege at all.Mujcic and Frijters' research confirms they do. The pair conducted a large-scale social experiment across the state of Queensland to find out if white people received special treatment over people of color. According to the researchers, Australia's treatment of \textbf{black} Aboriginals mimics the plight of \textbf{African} Americans. For instance, \textbf{black} Aboriginals only secured the right to vote in 1963, two years before the Voting Rights Act was signed into law in the United States. Three out of four modern-day indigenous Australians say they regularly experience \textbf{racism}, and 88 percent of \textbf{African} Americans feel that discrimination against \textbf{black} people persists.Against this backdrop, Mujcic and Frijters spearheaded an ambitious experiment to see how \textbf{race} and privilege play out in everyday life. The researchers tasked 29 young adult riders of white, Asian, \textbf{Indian}, and \textbf{black} descent to board buses with an empty transit card and see whether or not drivers would let them ride for free. Participants were told to say, 'I do not have any money, but I need to get to the [XX] station,' with XX station being out of walking distance. After analyzing more than 1,500 social interactions, what the researchers found was astounding.Asian and white participants were able to ride for free at nearly identical rates (72 percent), but bus drivers often declined the requests of \textbf{black} and \textbf{Indian} passengers. Fifty-one percent of free-ride requests from \textbf{Indian} riders were honored, while requests from \textbf{black} riders were twice as likely as those from whites and Asians to be turned down, with only 36 percent being able to board the bus and ride without paying.The disparities continued even when the subjects were dressed in business suits or military uniforms, with 67 percent of \textbf{black} and 83 percent of \textbf{Indian} passengers being allowed to ride for free compared with 97 percent of whites. Interestingly, \textbf{black} drivers also opted to give white riders a free pass in larger numbers than \textbf{black} riders (83 percent versus 68 percent), further highlighting the insidiousness of systematic \textbf{racism} and the engrained privilege white people enjoy.This privilege, or rather white folks' ability to avoid painful racial macro- and microaggressions, is felt in nearly every sector of society. In the workforce it manifests in employers choosing to interview candidates with 'white' names over those with 'ethnic' ones. In universities it shows up in schools giving preferential treatment to the children of alumni or donors while refusing to factor in \textbf{race}. And in the justice system, white privilege means \textbf{African} Americans make up 57 percent of the people in state prison for drug offenses, even though blacks and whites use drugs at similar rates and whites sell drugs at higher rates.Despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary, some Americans still doubt that white people benefit on the sole basis of their \textbf{race}.'It's heartbreaking that we have to have this conversation with people that we interact with on a daily basis who don't understand,' says Monica Castillo, a cultural critic who writes about media diversity.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The first man with the white \textbf{woman} made a good point that's exemplified in the rest of the episode.

Later in the episode with the \textbf{black} man as the 'thief' he's called out more as well as feared more and I believe that it partly comes down to what the first man said. The customers were quicker to call him out as a \textbf{black} man bc they were secure in the fact that they would be believed in their claims with little to no question bc the perpetrator was \textbf{black}.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Talk about this one ringing home, lol. I'll tell ya what happened to me once. I was a Chicago Police Officer for 20 years. I was at a restaurant and I was actually on duty but in civilian clothes working a desk assignment due to an injury. I was NOT armed; no radio/handcuffs/vest. I witnessed a guy steal the entire jar. He was running out the door with it. I had just ordered my food and sat down when this happened. You know what happened? An employee saw it from behind the counter and yelled out to him. I in turn sprung into action and grabbed the guy at the door as he tried to escape. The melee went into the street where another employee came out to my assistance where the two of us detained the guy until the on duty cops came in uniform and arrested him properly.In short the restaurant was located in a liberal part of town; Wicker Park (Chicago) and the store manager was initially reluctant to sign a complaint/press charges but the Sgt said "You yelled out for him to stop and a cop was here and he did. You can't refuse to sign now otherwise we just ain't gonna come to your restaurant if you need help in the future." So the mgr reluctantly signed a complaint. I got \textbf{nothing} but disdain from the employees like I was the bad guy (as this area of town is very anti-police). The mgr said "He was probably just hungry. Poor guy." I told her he's a \textbf{drug addict} and she looks at me scornfully and comments "How would you know that? You are just assuming as you met the guy two minutes ago." Well I go to court a month later and \textbf{nobody} showed up to press charges. What a shock, right? I was waiting for the offender to show up for the hearing and he was nowhere to be found. When his name got called a \textbf{woman} answered up and said she was his mother and her son (the bad guy) had another hearing in the adjacent courtroom. When the judge asked what he was charged with she replied she didn't know but I knew better. So I took it upon myself to go next door as they have misdemeanor court in one room and felonies in the other. When I walked in he was just called and it was for a drug charge. All I could do was laugh.Needless to say his theft charge from the tip jar was dismissed because the restaurant didn't show to press charges. He took a probation punishment for resisting arrest with me and that was it.I  went back to the restaurant to dine a few weeks later and wouldn't you know it?? Not only did I not get thanked for helping out but I was really frowned upon. Much to my surprise they comped me a free lunch but it was not with a smile; it was like they felt they had to do it. I have eaten there a few times since (full price meals afterwards) and everytime I could just sense not just a lack of gratitude but a complete disdain for my presence. I was a regular there but always ate off duty or in civilian clothing. They never knew I was a cop prior to that. Very uncomfortable for me like I was the thief returning to eat. I retired a short time afterwards and have said to myself after that incident (or "What would I do") in the future and I am done trying to play hero. I am no longer inclined to get involved and go out of my way to help anyone after that. About the only time would be if someone were getting beat sensely or a \textbf{woman}/child getting raped or kidnapped. Everyone wants to sue you and goofy judges and juries and going along with it.

Created during the new deal/reconstruction era after the great depression, it insured that those who worked even the simplest of jobs could afford to live because they were still doing honest work. I also never said the cost of living would be low, I'm saying minimum wage should be raised to accommodate the rising costs. The more money they make, the more money they'll spend, it's worked fine for Seattle and other places. People need something to work for. Yall complain your order isn't right but don't want to pay living wages, I wouldn't give two fucks about your food being right either. People like you are disgusting honestly.

Even if everyone went to college and got a fancy degree, there are still things that need to be done great and small. You want a pizza, someone has to deliver it.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small For starters, the title of this video implies \textbf{racism} and/or \textbf{gender} discrimination. Why not be neutral or somewhat neutral by titling the video as "Customers Steal Money...", "\textbf{Woman} and Man Steal Money...",  or "White \textbf{Woman} and \textbf{Black} Man Steal Money...."  The current title implies that the intended audience for the video are whites, and "Blonde" to further imply the \textbf{woman} is beautiful (which is literally repeated by John Quiones in the video...but the \textbf{black} man is never called "handsome"). This is so \textbf{common} in media where any non-white American is classified as a Sub-American and white Americans are simply "American" or relative pronoun. They will never say "European American" and "African/Asian/Native American" in the same narrative. Having a neutral title allows the viewer to decide if the scenarios are based on bigotry or not; and all Americans will feel as if they are being addressed as the audience. If emphasizing \textbf{race} was the intent, then they should have added a white male and a \textbf{black} female actor. If \textbf{gender} was the intent, title should have been "\textbf{Woman} and Man Steal Money..." As far as what I would do, I'd say something.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The reasons from each \textbf{gender} and \textbf{race} for not stopping the person is astonishing and yet not surprising. It's pretty much based on statistic. When men steal, the witness is afraid to intervene for their own safety. One of them thinking what if he had a weapon. And when the pretty white \textbf{woman} steals, it's excuses like that's on her, her karma. So they rationalize it as her loss instead of the money stolen from the hard worker. That older gentleman had more sense in his head. Younger guys not so much.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I think men are less willing to call out a pretty white \textbf{woman} because they know she's going to act the fool.

This isn't meant to be \textbf{racist}, but if a pretty \textbf{black} \textbf{woman} were caught, anyone would call them out. But let's face it white and \textbf{black} men are less likely to confront a pretty white \textbf{woman}. But white or \textbf{black} women will not discriminate, and call the \textbf{woman} out no matter the \textbf{age}, \textbf{race} or beauty. They proved that with the bicycle theft thing: Men of all races got called out, by mostly \textbf{black} and white men. Not so much by women, unless from a safe distance. \textbf{Black} women got called out, by everyone. In person or from a safe distance. White women got called out by all women.

Stop getting so sensitive about the fact that white people have destroyed this world and justify their actions with lies. It wasn't just Germans who oppressed Jews it was all Europeans. But now for some reason the holocaust is used as an excuse to make an apartheid state. The reason they don't hate Germans is because it's a massive lie.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I once watched a white \textbf{woman} and her daughter steal 2500 dollars worth of Brighton glasses, without saying anything. But to my defense, the only reason that i didn't is bcuz the store clerk, left the register to follow me around the store. When i went to pay for my 4 pair, of \$300 Brighton glasses, she went and checked the glasses and accused me of stealing them. She called the cops and they were about to arrest me. They decided to take me to the back and search me but i told them that if they searched me and i had \textbf{nothing}, i was suing. The manager came out and asked how did it happen... I told him that she left her position, where she could've seen everything from where she was and from the monitor behind the counter. The police asked to view the tape. When the clerk left her post, the White lady would go by the counter and put the glasses in her purse and at one point, the lady stood right next to the clerk, while she was watching me, and stole something...and then asked the clerk for help. When asked y didn't i say anything, bcuz u could clearly see that i saw them, i said that i would've said something but i thought it was funny how they were following me, wheni had \$7k in my pocket but the White lady, that was broke, was stealing shit in her face. The manager was livid. He apologized to me and fired the clerk on the spot...especially after he saw several white ppl stealing on camera, while she was following \textbf{black} ppl.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small jjosephdubya Irony as you are the one who is being a completely \textbf{racist} moron. Where in my comment did I deny the existence of \textbf{racism}? \textbf{Racism} does exist and every one of EVERY skin color does have to deal with it, especially white people who have to deal with it the most. There's no much more anti-white \textbf{racism} in this country than there is anything else. There are probably more \textbf{black} supremacists in this country than there are white supremacists, and in fact, \textbf{black} separatists outnumber the KKK here and BLM has out killed the KKK in the last 30 years alone. And if I am the reason why white people get hated, which is stupid as I am literally pointing out the flaws you people's mindset and reminding you that \textbf{racism} also affects white people. So while YOU are the fool here denying reality here, I am educating you people on the fact that white people also have to deal with \textbf{racism}. Also, you assumed that I burn tiki torches.

Keep on spewing out your resentment over your uni-dimensional interpretations on anything happening in society and its going to be four more years for him.

They are basically saying that whites and blacks can't live together (at all) and that it would be best if we all just split up and only lived with people of our own \textbf{race}. Then we wouldn't experience all this antagonistic and tribal attitude between people over the smallest things.

They got them thinking they are "innocent, precious lily little white girls" A lot of them are horrible, disgusting women and many are out to ruin men. When I worked in retail in a middle to upper class diverse area white women stole more than any other demographic. Some would grab stuff off the racks and return it saying they lost their receipt and get store credit, some would steal in the changing rooms, some put stuff in their baby strollers, some would buy a lot of stuff take it home and come back in grab the same stuff off the shelf and return it, they steal so much makeup and makeup testers, etc.. When they get caught they either put on their innocent sad white girl act or the "how dare you accuse me" act. The funny thing is regardless of them being the biggest thieves my coworkers and loss prevention still focused on minorities. Just look online, theres many forums with white women discussing stealing and how to not get caught. Lets not even get started on their horrible attitudes and how their feminism is really just a ploy to destroy men(and use the divorce and child support system to rob men of their money and freedom while they sit on their butts living off those checks) . btw im white/puertorican/\textbf{black} and I know other women have issues but I seriously dont know how they still are seen as "innocent pretty little white girls" and angels by most people especially men.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!27}1/267 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.375 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I LOOOOOVE our world! People asume things from looks and \textbf{race}! What a wonderful world, right?True Story that happened to me:So my brother is a light skin, and I am a dark skin. We don't look alike at all. Once we went to the store to buy some snacks for a party we were going to. I asked if he wanted me to pay. He said he had money, and asked me to grab his wallet which was in his front pocket. He didn't know that, and he was looking to see if it was in his back pocket. So what happened? We were about to pay and a \textbf{woman} noticed me taking his wallet. She calls me a thief, and smacks my hand. The \textbf{woman} was white, and since my brother looks white too, she pulled out her phone and said to my brother that I was going to steal his money and she was going to call the cops. So my brother saw I had his wallet in my hands and told me to give him his debit card. He payed for the snacks and we left. When we were outside, there were a couple of cop cars. The \textbf{woman} came running outside, went over to a cop, and came back with a cop with hand cuffs in his hands. The cop was ALSO white. The cop asked me if I stole money from my brother, but they didn't know it was my brother. So I just stared at him and then told my brother to explain everything. Why? Because I was the ‘thief.' I was the villain, the dark child stealing from the light child. Because whatever I said, they wouldn't believe. So my brother cleared things up with the cop. But the cop kept eyeing me.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Oh my there we go. I asked you to not get me wrong and both of you did, thanks. I'm NOT saying all blacks or in fact all men carry guns and also I am NOT saying that no women whatsoever carries a gun with her. Considering your argument "women feel defenseless without a gun": that is very true indeed but women tend to purchase pepper spray or tasers instead of a gun. Women are WAY less likely to commit a crime than men, doesn't matter if that's a \textbf{black} male or a white male or a hispanic male.My statistics are from the FBI, in case you want to look them up, just look for \textbf{gender} differences in crime.And yet again, as I said before. Do not get me wrong.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I think the \textbf{gender} had something to do with it. She was a pretty girl, not many people stopped her.I'm actually surprised that so many people stopped the guy, of course he was handsome as well but imo confronting someone who is bigger and stronger than you is very intimidating.I personally never had a problem doing it though. I'm 5'1 and a half (the half counts), and one time when I was in 9th grade, almost a decade ago, this group of older guys walked past my sister, her friend and I and called my sister a slut (we had never seen them before). I get out of control when someone says or does rude shit like that. I turned around and told them to say it to my face, they told me to come over to them then, so I started running towards them like the bat shit \textbf{crazy} little girl that I was and they literally ran away. Both my mom and sister were mad at me and told me I shouldn't have done that because they could've hurt me. This other time probably a year later, my friends and I were walking to the mall and there was a couple outside of it. Now they were at least 20, but she was crying and he was like shaking her, yelling, and being very aggressive. I automatically started yelling wtf are you doing to her and started walking towards him when my friends literally pulled me away. Now he looked super sketch, baggy clothes and shit. He also was super angry, so my friends not wanting to see me die did do the right thing in that situation but I can't help feeling guilty for not making sure she was alright.\textbf{Race} is only a problem to racists. You see anyone doing something they shouldn't be, whether they are a small white girl or a big \textbf{black} guy or anything in between, at least say something to someone like police, security, or a worker at a store if you don't want to confront them.
