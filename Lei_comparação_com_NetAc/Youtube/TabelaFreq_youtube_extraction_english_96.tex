  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Women do not belong in politics or the media. The modern feminist movement, pampered and deferred to, must continue to find things to complain about.

Everything about feminists is becoming negative and dysfunctional, a problem wherever they are.Certainly feminists have a point in their willingness to declare a "birth strike" to avoid using up the planet's resources.

I live in Ohio and my Catholic school has a terrible heating system as it is over 50 years \textbf{old} and as of last year, before I started running cross country and working out, whenever I didn't eat breakfast or forgot to put on a long sleeve undershirt in the winter, my hands would be cold to the point that I can't see how it was health, and I would occasionally start shivering. I am not allowed to simply put on a sweater as girls can. Despite this, I would choose that any day over sweating, even just that slightest amount. which leads me to think about how boys at times were forced to wear pants in hot weather which is unbearably uncomfortable whereas girls could simply wear a skirt. This makes absolutely no sense. Anatomically, it makes entirely more sense for males to wear skirts than females. It would be so much more comfortable and stop an extremely \textbf{common} problem that all men have had to deal with.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Okay, so I read the article that Radhika Sanghani wrote regarding the air-conditioning, and I'm disappointed in the intellectual rigor of her article.  For starters, she says that the problem of sexist AC units is "backed up by brand new scientific research," but the article that she references that has the supposed "new" research study does not, in fact, cite the study so that people can explore the research further.  In other words, Sanghani relies on the research of the author of the other article, even though that author did not cite the study used to prove that AC units are sexists.Furthermore, the research that Sanghani did actually cite came from 1998 (not too recent).  The "study" (it was actually a brief summary of a study, as the document contained no sections of methods, data analysis, etc.) called "Cold hands, warm hearts" examined how a person's \textbf{sex} determined both core and hand temperatures.  The report showed that women on average had higher core temperatures than men, but that women on average had lower hand temperatures than men.  The authors of the report attributed the colder hand temperatures of women to menstrual status (i.e., premenstrual or postmenstrual) and menstrual cycle stage, as "postmenstrual women older than 50 years had significantly lower hand and core temperatures than premenstrual women below the \textbf{age} of 13," and "women in the first 14 days of their cycle were more likely to have lower core temperatures," and as a result lower hand temperatures, "than women in the last 14 days" (Kim, Richardson, Roberts, Gren, \& Lyon, 1998, p. 1/2).I criticize the rigor of Kim et al. (1998), and by extension the intellectual rigor of Sanghani, because the article did not specify just how many of the 141 women used in the study fell into categories that would make them more likely to experience colder hand and core temperatures.  More specifically, even though the reported study had participants ranging from 1 to 84 years, it could have had a large number of women who were, for instance, postmenstrual or at earlier stages of their menstrual cycle.  If this were the case (again, there is no way for us to know because the authors did not show this information), then the data could misrepresent the reality of women's experience with core and hand temperatures.  Overall, by not showing which of the 141 in their relation to their menstrual status and cycle stage, Kim et al. (1998) lessened the credibility of their reported study, and Sanghani lessened the intellectual rigor of her article by including it.In closing, I would like to say that if Sanghani wants to make her argument stronger, than she needs stronger evidence.  Also, it doesn't help her point when she includes a picture of a female employee who even though she is covered with a blanket, her toes are exposed!

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Timeline for Feminism and Humanity's destruction:2033:  Breaking News : A group calling themselves the Feminazis has been found responsible for several counts of aggression towards men. There have been repeated incidents involving men's bathrooms exploding, male student dorms set on fire, and little boys abducted by women and \textbf{Feminazi} men. This is a problem we shouldn't ignore. 2038: The Feminazis have grown into an organized group of terrorists striking fear into the hearts of regular people, inspiring radical feminists to join their cause, becoming part of the ever growing threat. Attacks become more \textbf{common} and happen at a larger scale. 2040: The word declares war against the Feminazis. The struggle becomes greater by the day, as Feminazis take over smaller countries and infiltrate the army, Air Force, and navy. NASA, JAXA, Roscosmos, and every other space agency is taken over, employees are held hostage, and forced to work for the Feminazis, completely cutting the world off it's satellites. 2044: Armies worldwide are being overrun, and generals know it's only a matter of time before they lose to the Feminazis. World leaders order a complete evacuation of the soon to be taken countries, to a fortress, called Unity, in Greenland. The structure had been ordered into construction in 2033 by the leaders of the US, Russia, and China, all of them knowing feminism would come to this. The war rages on and on and on, and Earth becomes a nuclear post-apocalyptic wasteland. 2045: Evacuation was not completely successful, as only 10 percent of the world's population made it to the Unity fortress. 2046: Feminazis end up taking over the world's superpowers. They overthrow China, Russia, and the US. Men and non-feminists women alike who were not able to go in the 2044 global evacuation are thrown into concentration camps where they are forced to work and are abused in horrendous, unspeakable ways by the Feminazis. This post-apocalyptic world is dominated by the Feminazis. 2049: What's left of the Anti-\textbf{Feminazi} humanity only exists in bandit groups and outposts across the Wastelands, the \textbf{Feminazi} concentration camps, and the Unity fortress at Greenland. Slowly, but surely, they grow tired of hiding. The spark lights up. Two years of propaganda, speeches, and planning go by. They send the elite to infiltrate in the \textbf{Feminazi} army. 2051: The Unity Fortress in Greenland announces the Revolution. Infiltrated Unity soldiers and scientists give the Fortress access to communication and surveillance satellites. They contact every bandit group, every concentration camp, and announce the oppressed wouldn't have to hide and live in their cells for much longer. The roving groups and imprisoned join the revolution. 2053: The concentration camps have fallen, torn down from within by the Anti-Feminists once held captive. \textbf{Feminazi} armies are being torn down by the Revolution, people are flocking to the Unity Fortress while the bandit groups use guerrilla warfare to fight for the cause. It takes a long time, but after fighting for so long, they seem to finally have a chance. 2054: The war is finally coming to an end. \textbf{Feminazi} leaders are being executed worldwide by both the Unity Fortress and bandit groups alike. The war quickly dials down and becomes a hunt for the remains of the Feminazis. Spec Ops groups are sent from the Fortress to hunt, and bandit groups are recruited for a price.2055: The Hunt ends, and humanity is free of the Feminazis forever. Now comes the hard part. They will have to find a way to live and rebuild in this inhospitable wasteland. Some are eager to do this, but others look to the stars. Scientists and \textbf{engineers} from NASA, Roscosmos, and Space X announce they had been building numerous massive underground and surface bases on Mars, knowing this would be humanity's fate. After six long months of debating from the Fortress, most of humanity agrees to launch to Mars, while 3 percent of the remaining 10 percent want to stay behind and rebuild the Earth. The 7 percent of humanity that will leave for Mars vote for their future president, and Elon Musk is elected. Those on Earth concentrate on rebuilding. They stare at the wasteland that lay before them, and set their jaws. They had allowed this to happen. All this destruction could've been avoided if only they hadn't allowed Feminism to come this far. They shake their heads. They rebuild. Those on Mars live in their thriving, giant cities, and they stare at the vast, orange-\textbf{r\textbf{ed}} landscape before them. They take deep breaths and they all think the same thing. They will start anew, and they will not let Feminism arise again. They will not repeat the same mistakes that drove Earth to its destruction. They learned from their mistakes. And so, with their great machines digging into the \textbf{r\textbf{ed}}, mineral rich soil and pumping carbon dioxide into the Martian atmosphere, Terraformation begins its course. And humanity rises again.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Common, Engineers, Feminazi, Red & \cellcolor{green!27} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Ethnicity - Native-American, Gender - Female intelligence, Nationality - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}9/815 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.104 \\  \hline

They should go get a three-piece suit tailored to them at the company's expense, and then wear it around the office for two or three weeks during the summer. If after that time, they say it's still too cold, the company should then raise the office temperature, and the employee can then wear the suit for another couple of weeks before giving a final answer on the temperature. If after raising the temperature, it feels comfortable, then it gets left there, and the employee continues wearing the suit to work, having paid \textbf{nothing} for it. If however, the temperature becomes too uncomfortable, they have to reimburse the company for the entire amount that the suit and tailoring cost, and the temperature gets put back at what it originally was at.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!27}1/145 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.69 \\  \hline
