  \cellcolor{green!27}\small This infantallization begins in the home, kids are not thought critical thinking, most are over-indulged and over protected. My friend's 19yo daughter, in her first year of college, 'does not know' how to take a bus/subway, cannot make a doctor's appt and get there...this is the result of smother parenting that results in delayed adult behavior/thinking. The secondary gain for the 'smother' parent is it ensures they will always be needed,  they ensure their children will make \textbf{zero} decisions without consulting them on some level for approval.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Much of what Gottschalk identifies as cultural infantilization comes down to the shift Gilles Deleuze describes as that from 'disciplinary' societies based on enclosed spaces with their more oblique disciplinary and punitive structures, to the so-called 'societies of control'. These are founded on open, interconnected systems and technologies that appear 'open' and to provide individuals greater freedom, e.g. in the form of highways or pocket-sized internet terminals, while actually multiplying power's means of control. You can see this in the traditional right-wing understanding of 'economic freedom' as synonymous with deregulation of labour laws, but also in its very specific conception of 'freedom of speech' as liberated from the cruel and arbitrary limitations imposed by experts and expert knowledge. It has to be said, the right has been very effective in selling this right to talk out your ass, especially when done by corporate-sponsored politicians, as a source of civil empowerment. And of course, Silicon Valley libertarian tech bros dream of \textbf{nothing} else but circumventing 'gatekeepers' and putting traditional news media out of business.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small An example is the government making flavored ejuice illegal, allegedly to protect children, when it's used by adults who WANT the flavors. Also, legalization of cannabis, also allegedly to protect children, when adults are the ones using it. In both cases, the government is protecting industries that are provably harmful (\textbf{alcohol} and tobacco), while denying adults the rights to use those substances, even though they are provably safer. Perhaps their efforts would be more appropriately aimed at people selling those substances to children.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I feel like in some ways safe spaces are a trap specifically on college/uni campuses. In the rest of the world however, I think \textbf{q\textbf{ueer}} cafes would be a good idea simply because of community and consistent attacks on trans people in public spaces and the police are not properly protecting minorities (or are deliberately targeting them in some instances). Your college/uni already has security for physical attacks/hate speech so there is no need for a 'safe place' in terms of being able to run away from bigots. No. Be present. Insult them with your presence because they are specifically the types of people who need to know you are there whether they like it or not, you won't be silent, and your rights will be protected.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small nobody else finds this terminology grossly condescending?as a sociologist, what you want are operationalisable definitions that can be measured with some degree of \textbf{common} agreement -- so as to avoid personal biases. calling certain behaviours or outcomes "infantile" barely qualifies as any sort of definition, much less unbiased. now, i'm sure the actual papers published would touch on these methodological issues more; but it strikes me that the key term itself seems controversial or deliberately provocative.that said, some of the examples he gave don't exactly qualify as "infantile" either. being "hooked" to devices is not necessarily being "self-absorbed", and to me continues this condescending trend of so-called "adults" just admonishing the millennial culture with little or no understanding. sure, some of the worst users of smartphones could probably be diagnosed as addicted by a psychiatrist; but that doesn't mean being heavily reliant on technology is infantile. have you seen housewives who spend hours on the telephone? do we call that infantile? what about people who stopped reading once the radio became a thing? or the people who stopped listening to storytellers once the printed press was a thing? the smartphone is a tool, and it really depends on how the user chooses to use it. are some of the more narcissistic users getting more selfish using it? maybe. does that mean an entire generation is being infantilized? where is the leap in logic here?it is amusing that david is the one who gave the most compelling example of infantilization: safe spaces in higher education. when infantilization is "defined" as artificially lowering or restricting the content in order to suit/impose lower intellectual activity, that is a definition that can actually be measured. that said, safe spaces also has to do with the politicisation of academia, where students facing disenfranchisement and in a moral panic about far-right elements surfacing in their campus chose to react with some level of activism, albeit in an ill-advised form. student activism is a great way to self-actualise, if you ask me -- the real issue is why aren't their seniors and the college admin giving them better advice? why are deans ingratiating the students' worst impulses in demanding censorship? why not sit them down and talk it out?in the end, academic points are difficult to make in a 15min interview. maybe we should be doing a book club and reading the author's book too.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Common, Nobody & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}2/402 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.498 \\  \hline

Or is the destruction simply buying toys? If so that's a \textbf{weird} kind of destruction.Star Wars fans are among these collectors. Why Star Wars, and not anything else?

I said "grown men these days who fill their homes with childrens toys they bought for themselves"."I'm arguing that we do not know the \textbf{mental} disposition of collectors. A collector of something (perhaps toys) could be more mentally stable than you, or me. Emphasis should be on "me" if your paranoia arises again.What nuance in your quoted phrase "grown men these days who fill their homes with childrens toys they bought for themselves" demonstrates the \textbf{mental} disposition of those men. Is it "bought for themselves" because from what I understand collectors do mostly buy what they collect for themselves. So if that's your point I don't see the demonstration.I'm reminded of the outrage over S\&M practitioners, and the armchair \textbf{mental} health evaluations that non-professionals do on the \textbf{mental} disposition of people who do S\&M. There was a study not so long ago evaluating the \textbf{mental} disposition of S\&M practitioners. In the study it was found that those who participate in S\&M had on average a healthier \textbf{mental} stability than non-S\&M practitioners. The occurrence of \textbf{mental} illness was much lower in S\&M practitioners. For instance there was less depression in that group compared to non-S\&M people.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small In my entire career of collegiate education, not once did I see the invocation of safe-space, trigger-warning installments anywhere, on any campus. Albeit, I was an older student and already traveled and well ingratiated in the "adult world" of complainers and whiners, and had a strictly feminist education based on Science and critical thinking.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Ancient Greek, Ancient Rome, and Europe in the middle ages filled themselves with childishness of various entertainment to the point of harm too, and the aristocracies/rulers and theocracies used it to control the masses... theater and track games, chariot races and gladiator fights, jousting, fencing, sword, and archery matches.  Today we include the ball sports, concerts, movies, and video games.   When entertainment becomes too extreme holding too much attention and taking more time than other things in life happiness and means of fulfillment we're in trouble.My experience thus far in my mid 30's, having traveled on business around the US including several southern states, western states, mid-west, and eastern states as well as abroad in Europe... people in general are \textbf{dumb}.

For example in farming a total replacement with hydroponics would result in a 400 rise in productivity above the current rate while also eliminating the need for some massively complex and expensive maschinery, pesticides and would lower the transport costs as you can build hydroponic farms right next to population centers.Same goes with housing, Technology(planned obselescense and waste of resources to deliberately make cheaper inferior versions of the tech, etc.), services (bullshit jobs), etc.Eliminating the threat of poverty, providing healthcare to all and giving people enough with a single job so that they can pursue self actualization would eradicate a lot of sources of misery while also make a far greater amount of the population happy.Our wealth distribution is not based on productivity, wages have stagnated while productivity skyroketed in the digital \textbf{age}. Half of the planet's resources are in the hands of a literal handful of poeple, them being that productive is a mathematical impossibility. This is no bug but a feature of capitlaism. On top of that it's outright insane to not consider a full time job enough for a decent life at our current level of advancement/abundance.Don't get me wrong, you can still have an incentive system built in a post-scarcity economy, however you don't need to tie it into one's living standard when there is no scarcity to balance. That's a barbaric if not outright primitive practice.If anything I'd propose a system of networked shared high living standards paired with a stystem where excellence in work is the pre-requisite to be eligible to become a politician.That way you no longer have a barbaric system, you have incentives in place, and you have a meritocracy through wich you ensure that all of your politicians are competent and driven enough to be worthy of having their name on the ballot.There's also the thing that by 2030 38 of jobs will be gone and 60-80 by 2050 meaning that a supermajority would have to be considered as "failures" and suffer under capitlaism despite an overabundance.It's like having replicator technology from star trek but only allowing those who own the intellectual property to have enough money to use them.And if we are to add in the upcoming tech in genetic and cybernetic augmentation then we're entering a massive dystopian shithole of a mess if we keep going this way.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/425 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.235 \\  \hline
