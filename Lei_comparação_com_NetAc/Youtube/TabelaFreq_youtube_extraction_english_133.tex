\hline\cellcolor{green!27}\small I totally agree we need some more \textbf{age} diversity in Instagram and the rest of social and traditional media. Seeing teen after teen is boring as hell. I just started unsubscribing like \textbf{crazy}, and if I cant find anything worthwhile in instagram im going to uninstall that app. So many accounts are just sneak peeks of the main you tube channel, or a bunch of teen makeup pictures, like OMG create some frigging content for instagram or get off the frigging platform! Keep it fresh! Change it up every couple of weeks or months god.I like channels mostly from people close to my \textbf{age} or older. My only gripe is people making boring as hell, irrelevant videos. I often want to see the information Hot and Flashy puts out there,  but the pace, delivery, content and editing is boring as hell. Just can't.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I am just getting far enough into my career to have money to venture into places like Sephora to buy make-up. There is no way I could have afforded anything other than drugstore make-up. I do believe that drugstore stuff has come a long way and I still buy some brand (cruelty free). I really didn't know much about application and keeping up with trends and youtube has helped tremendously. I, in particular, like discussions around techniques and products that help with fine lines and wrinkles. I would love to see more youtubers my \textbf{age} or older.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Thank you so much for the topic.  I am 59 and love make up.  However, I think there has been a lot of advancement in including all ages/races, etc. then when I was your \textbf{age}.  Just on the cover of Vogue (March '17) a plus size model is included.  I love seeing Lauren Hutton modeling again!  Yes, we still need more colors, sizes, etc. but it has improved.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/68 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.471 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Totally agree and even though I have a few years on you, I love skin care and makeup. If you look at my bathroom counter, I could be considered a makeup \textbf{junkie}! I also would pose that it is not  frivolous pursuit. I actually do skincare and cosmetics classes for older women in my little corner of the world. I strongly believe it really helps women's self-confidence and self-esteem. It has become a real campaign for me. So, keep up the good fight, Rebecca!

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small BRAVO, BRAVO, BRAVO!!!! Holly and I have had our Over 40 YouTube channel for almost two years and have a painfully small following. I wish there was a way to target women over 40...but that's another topic. I also wish there was a stronger over 40 YouTube community where we can support other over 40 YouTubers. :(I hear ya about cosmetic companies and advertising. Don't they realize that older women have money to spend on beauty? Probably more than early 20 somethings? It irks me too when I see 17 year \textbf{old} GIRLS modeling for a anti-aging product. And don't even get me started about \textbf{thin} women modeling plus size fashion (my rage is real).Great video Rebecca!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Old, Thin & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Physical Identity - Physical Features & \cellcolor{green!5}2/119 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.681 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I agree with you. It is always a 20 year \textbf{old} selling wrinkle cream. It is wonderful that companies are finally using models with different skin tones but you rarely see them use models of different ages or different body shapes and you rarely see Native American, \textbf{Indian}, or Asian models. It would be wonderful if ALL types of women were represented and if Benetton can do it, why can't makeup companies?\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Indian, Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - Native-American & \cellcolor{green!27}2/72 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.778 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small In 43 and totally agree!  Sometimes I feel like an \textbf{old} bat watching the younger gurus, simply because that's what ppl think is ideal.  Fortunately, there are tons of beautiful 40 something's out there and we deserve a chance to have our faces all over the beauty community as well;) All of you gorgeous you tubers over 40 are definitely my favorites to watch.  I feel like I can relate more, but for some reason, these makeup companies aren't realizing how many of us there actually are!!!! Hopefully your video opens up some of their eyes and they pay attention to the fact that, we are all just women wanting to feel good about ourselves no matter how \textbf{old} we are!!!!

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small SERIOUSLY. I like seeing women my \textbf{age} on instagram and youtube. And I don't like to see women our \textbf{age} photoshopped to hell in advertisements. I wear more and buy more makeup now than I did when I was in my 20s. I'm not ashamed of my \textbf{age} and I don't try to hide it and look 20. I'm happier than I've ever been.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Im 53 and totally agree...but not only advertisement ...I think they need to do more research on products for maturing skin. Come up with foundations and concealers that REALLY cover wrinkles, dark circles, \textbf{age} spots..not just claim to and then when you get them home your  under eye area looks worse than using \textbf{nothing} and your foundation has settled into all your lines and wrinkles not to mention polka \textbf{dot} pores!

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I'm definitely over 40 but I enjoy relating to all \textbf{age} groups. I don't think there's a shortage of representation for the over 40 group at all.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Yes! Yes! A thousand times, YES! I spend a lot of my hard earned money on make-up. I want to see it on someone closer to my \textbf{age}.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small AMEN!!! I just turned 40, I am established in a career, I make very good money, and more importantly to makeup companies, I spend a shit load of money on makeup and skincare. I'm platinum at Ulta, rouge at Sephora and a Beautylish VIP. I've been those things for years and years. I have the extra money to spend, I'm a member of a very profitable demographic. Seeing 18-24 year olds in anti-aging skin care adverts bugs the ever living crap out of me too. I love make up. Let me stress, I LOVE makeup, but what works for a 18-28 year \textbf{old} isn't necessarily going to work for me anymore. I would love to see brands with multi-generational models so you can see what one product looks like on people of every \textbf{age}.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}2/134 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.493 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Thanks \textbf{hun} for being the voice to thousands of women.  I am 46 and I still love makeup just as much today as I did as a teen.  So, with that being said one of the biggest things that I feel the more mature \textbf{woman} wants and looks for are products the same as what weve always been in to, only now we look for the products that look, feel and are better for our skin as we \textbf{age}.  Products that are maybe geared towards the mature \textbf{woman}, instead of products that are more categorized for every \textbf{woman}.  Ya know?!  Anyway, our interests as the more mature \textbf{woman} change as well.   Such as the colors that catch our attention and so forth.  Anyway, thank you for your channel and thank you for being the voice to be heard...see ya next time!!!   xoxo   <3\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Hun, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Gender - General, Nationality - German & \cellcolor{green!27}6/143 & \cellcolor{green!27}4.196 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small OMG thank you for this video! I am 52 and I love love my make up but there young skin has \textbf{nothing} on mine. I louvre the young you tubers they are so talented and their make up is stunning on their beautiful young taught skin. But that same make up will never look the same on my crepe puffy eyes and parched skin, But I do the best I can with what I have. I still love to play with different looks and like to stay on trend as much as I possibly can and will still look good on me. Also don't these companies understand that we are already established \textbf{woman} with more money to spend especially on high end products. If you look at the comments on a lot of the young influences they are complaints of the YouTuber not using more drug store/inexpensive products. Obviously young ladies just starting out in life with smaller budgets to spend on make up.

I have searched and searched and have discovered several channels which speak to me, uppiesbeads59, Angie at Hot and Flashy and yourself of course, but these beauty companies really need to get on board - we need to be sold makeup that works for us and not just have the anti-\textbf{ageing} element pushed down our throats, \textbf{ageing} is a privilege not a disability!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Ageing & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/123 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.813 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Those millions ( in every country)  of over 40 \textbf{woman} also have the money to buy stuff if those companies would just get with the program.I have asked Youtube for YEARS to make a directory so we could easily find \textbf{woman} creators  over 40. No luck.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/46 & \cellcolor{green!27}4.348 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small You hit it spot on! I would much prefer to watch a beauty blogger who is around my \textbf{age} because we have similar concerns and I can relate more to them. I've been trying to find more channels that I can relate to. I'm glad you brought this subject up because it does feel like we are being overlooked in the makeup industry. Hopefully someone from a makeup company will see this and cause them to think for a minute!!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/80 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.25 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I applaud your efforts to speak out on our behalf. I have wondered if more women in the older \textbf{age} range would buy more makeup if it was easier to find products that really look good on different varieties of more mature skin. I sense that cosmetics companies are pandering now to consumers who just buy more and more, regardless of the quality of the product. Like the disappointing holiday stuff that fewer and fewer seem to appreciate.  I'm very selective in what I will buy, but I will put out the money for an excellent, effective product. Thanks again for speaking up!!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/103 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.971 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I so appreciate all the work you put in to informing us about products, how they perform, and what is new and worth trying, \& your awesome personality. There is \textbf{nothing} so frustrating than getting suckered into buying things that don't work. The problems we had in our teens \& twenty's compared to now is a whole different ball game.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Preach on sister!  I deliberately  look for the older You Tube Video  personality who is closers to my \textbf{age} who can instructions me about which makeup products works best for the more mature skin.  Maybe the product industry will become as wise as we hope to be.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Well... as long as we allow the whole beauty industry to tell us we need to "anti-age" (which is of course impossible) ... that we are not allowed to grow \textbf{old} this is not surprising that it's like this !!!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}1/40 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.5 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I'm almost 39 and I so agree!!!!!!! It's very hard to relate sometimes and I APPRECIATE more mature youtubers, their opinions, tutorials and keeping it real for women our \textbf{age}.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I rarely get sent anything from the big makeup companies like Too Faced, Smashbox, Becca, etc. They would rather send PR to an 18 yr \textbf{old} youtuber rather than someone over 50.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}1/32 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.125 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Rebecca, sista, you go!  It's so true, that we have these younger Youtubers who give us their opinion as to whether they think something might work with "more mature" skin or "older skin.  I appreciate them trying to 'guess' but they truly have no idea because they don't have the life experience and their skin hasn't changed due to years earned, ha.  Your humour and your enjoyment of makeup and skin care without taking it too seriously, is always welcome and appreciated!  Your videos are always on my top to watch list...okay, maybe because I live through your addiction to eye palettes, but I digress....I'm sitting here at 51 y ears \textbf{old} and still trying to find that consistently reliable concealer, ha!

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Yes!!!!!! I am 41 and I spend on makeup like a mad \textbf{woman}. And I was happy to find you who is like me and loves makeup. There is not enough of us.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Just a 62 year \textbf{old} subscriber here throwing in my two cents.  First, love your videos and your message.  Second, I love women supporting women and I think we can always learn from each other, regardless of \textbf{age}, and that's reflected in the variety of different ages of women whose channels I support.  I understand why a company puts a 20 year \textbf{old} in their ads, but that doesn't mean that I'm not smart enough to recognize it and be insulted by it.  I hope the cosmetics and skincare industry hear us, and meanwhile intend to show support in as meaningful way as is available to me.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}3/107 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.804 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I am 45 and on one hand i would love to see you as a model for ad campaigns but on the other hand I love the \textbf{woman} you are so much I would probably buy everything you were on and that would not be good for the pocket book. lol. you are an amazing \textbf{woman} and I could watch you all day.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/63 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.175 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small You are so right on the money!  I'm 51 and I love makeup and skincare more than ever because I have more issues to deal with now.  I also have more money finally to spend on it but I don't want all that \textbf{crazy} luxury makeup that's filled with perfume and other crap that aggravates my extremely sensitive skin.  I would also like to see the popular eyeshadow pallets being presented in a more daytime application instead of all this heavy, \textbf{crazy} stuff that you can't wear anywhere but to the club that all the young Youtubers do.  I love watching your channel because you are so down to Earth and you relate to us in a real way.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I'm 42 and a stay at home mom. I feel like everything geared toward my \textbf{age} are always super expensive and high end. Even the drugstore products that are anti-aging are expensive. I'm a makeup and skin care \textbf{junkie} and I do feel like  the over 40 group are ignored. Thank you for speaking up for us!!

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I always thinks it's funny when commercials for anti aging products have 20 year \textbf{old} models and say how great their products are for fine lines and wrinkles. Like if I use their product I will look 20. And I'm thinking, that 20 year \textbf{old} doesn't even have fine lines and wrinkles.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}2/52 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.846 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Oh but to dream!  Wouldn't it be so nice to see make up companies working with women my \textbf{age} to share and promote products!

Great video!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/39 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.564 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Agreed!! I'll be 38 this year and it's hard to find tutorials/ads/makeup that can help me with how to apply makeup etc as my skin changes.  I love your channel ... it proves beauty transcends all ages and just because we get older doesn't mean we can represent just as well as a 20 year \textbf{old}.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small PREACH!! Im 42 and I have far more discretionary income than I did at 25, I don't understand why the suits don't do the math, completely \textbf{dumb}, and yeah an 18 year \textbf{old} in an anti-aging ad is in NO way aspirational to me, it just makes me laugh.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I couldn't agree more! Companies, aim a product at the mature \textbf{woman} and then use a YOUNGSTER to try to sell it to us! It's downright insulting!

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I hope your message gets to the cosmetic companies. I'm probably dreaming here, but I would love to be able to walk into Sephora and Ulta to a special section featuring new, quality make up and skin care products that cater to older consumers where I could \textbf{zero} in on a selection of nutrient rich foundations, eye palettes without glitter, moisture rich face, eye and lip formulas etc. I think cosmetic companies are missing a huge opportunity to \textbf{zero} in on a large and 'spendy' as you say, mature demographic.  BTW, I am 60 and I love your videos.  Even though you are not my \textbf{age}, skin tone, skin type, you are so candid and honest and I love that you cover so many drug store, affordable  products.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Thank you!  You and I are the same \textbf{age} and, I too, have teenagers.  I did not become interested in beauty and makeup until my early forties.  My kids were growing up and I had more time to research, learn, shop and experiment with makeup.  Often, women in their forties finally feel more established emotionally and financially and are more willing to spend on beauty products.  Makeup companies are ovelooking this.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/71 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.408 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Im over 50 and I am in total agreement with you.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I just recently started watching you tube makeup videos \@41 and the only reason was because I wanted anti aging skin care advice and makeup for aging skin. Angie \@hot and Flashy was the first and love her. I've started branching out a bit more and I'm trying to try a little harder with my makeup.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I agree with you 100,!!!  We can use some of the same makeup as the younger ladies, but it doesn't even apply on me like it does them.  I'm 52, I would love to see more makeup and skin care video's that relate to how I would do things that fit my \textbf{age}.  If the person i'm watching isn't at least 40 it really isn't relevant to how it would preform on me.  I get tickled when I'm watching a video and they talk about a product settling into their wrinkles and they might be 20-30 years \textbf{old}.  I truly hope you get a good response from this video...BTW, I love your video's, I've been watching for a long time and I love your website.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Good video! I don't even watch you tubers like Nikki Tutorials anymore and have unsubbed because her videos are filtered and she doesn't look like that at ALL and it's too depressing when you start to compare yourself to a fake image at my \textbf{age}.
