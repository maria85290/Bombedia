But at least i know what a Baby boomer, Gen X, and Millennial are. Baby Boomers are mid 1940's through early 1960's. Gen X is mid 1960's through early 1980's. Gen X stops at like 1980. Millennial start at about 1981-1996. There's a lot of people out there who don't even know what generation they are. Say "I'm a Gen X i was born in 1984". No dumbass your a early Millennial.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small This guy is full of shit.  He knows absolutely \textbf{NOTHING} about Dopamine or basic human neurology.Dopamine is not just a "reward" chemical.  It serves a MULTITUDE of purposes and without it in our brains, we'd become catatonic.  It expands blood vessels, and it even assists in RESISTING impulsive behaviors.  People with ADHD, unlike what this jackass is saying in some of his talks, are in part suffering from decreased dopamine activity, thus making it difficult to resist urges.  It's got \textbf{nothing} to do with looking on your phone or being on social media, and saying it's a "misdiagnosis" is undermining the hundreds of thousands of professionals who've done more peer-reviewed research in one year of their lives than this asshole could even understand in a lifetime.You know how else dopamine works?  In conjunction with a multitude of other neurochemicals.  You don't just get a "dopamine rush" when having \textbf{sex}, drinking, or eating, you're also getting adrenaline, endorphin,  opioids, and many others.  Hell, even in a reward process, Dopamine isn't responsible for making you feel good, it's responsible for releasing the chemicals, like opioids, that make you feel good.  In other words, Dopamine is not a simple scapegoat you can pin to the reason why the digital \textbf{age} has people looking at their cell phones and engaging more prevalent through social media than in real life.  This is the argument of a pseudo-Luddite using pseudo-science and charm than actual information.This man is attempting broad stroke the greatest problem the Millenial generation is facing through talking down to them about how much time they're spending on the internet, and not the litany of other issues that are plaguing our society as a whole.  Before that, we had parents saying that the damn death metal and satan was killing us all, and before that the damn hippies, and before that rock and roll.  He's a fraud, a liar, and he's getting away with it every time someone believes his shit.  Millenials know how to interact, and how to form deep, meaningful relationships.  They know how to appreciate a hard day's work, and they aren't some mysterious creature that can be explained by a single neurochemical.  They are people, they are individuals, and \textbf{nothing} more. Externalizing these behaviors on something like Dopamine is a useless oversimplification.  Given that Simon is grouping this issue as a "Millenial" issue overlooks the fact that Millenial brains are largely unchanged from the generations before them, thus Dopamine works the exact same way as it would in a Baby Boomers brain than it would a Gen X brain, and all of them have been exposed to modern technology and communication, and therefore are not immune to the trappings he's merely making up.  It's about the individual.  There are reasons why someone attaches a value to a behavior like checking facebook every 2 minutes, and if it's truly a problem in their life that's keeping them from their own perceived success it needs to be examined on the individual level.  Before the dopamine comes a thought and a behavior, and that is all dependent on the individual and their life and outlook on it.In short, this talk is all bullshit, and this man is shamelessly promoting himself using misinformation.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Nothing, Sex & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Youngsters, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}5/543 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.921 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small ​\@King yes, im well aware that there are people from my generation and even older generations that think that "Free" schooling is a good thing. But the majority of the people who think that way are millennials,.   once again, \textbf{nobody} should be forced to use their own hard earned pay check to pay for other people's education.  Its not my responsibility to fund other people's education. The only responsibility I have is helping my own kids. And even then, i've taught my kids to do for themselves and be independent. Bad parenting is one of the reasons millennials are coddled and feel entitled.   You need to get this entitlement mentality out of your head. I assume that you're an adult? So you should know that part of being an ADULT is learning how to stand on your own two feet. Not having other people paying your way of life. This is a huge part of the problem of why millennials refuse to do for themselves. Because of people like you that coddle them and not allowing them to do for themselves.  When you have a system that forces people to take  care of these kids, you dont motivate the kids to be self sufficient. Once again, once a person reaches adulthood, they are responsible for themselves. Many of the youths of today want to play "adult" when it comes to partying, drinking and having \textbf{sex} with multiple people. But when it comes to the RESPONSIBILITY that comes after that, then they want help from others. These people  cant be an adult for some things and expect help on other things. It doesnt work that way.  If  they want to play the grown folks game then they need to take the grown folks responsibility and  consequences that comes along with it. Simple as that\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nobody, Sex & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/303 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.66 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@King Ohh..Are we a little butt hurt here???  The problem really is, people like YOU with this entitlement mentality. And anyone who disagrees with your views, you get triggered and offended. are you sure you're not a millennial yourself? If you think that paying for people's tuition is a good thing then perhaps  you should use all your savings and pay for everyone elses tuition and to see if you can make the world a happy place. But dont expect MOST people to go along with you.. And the ones that do go along with you are entitled  freeloaders with an entitlement complex."How is speaking on college expenses somehow relate to everything in life? "......Because  as i mentioned before, one of the problems is that kids dont save for their schooling and splurge on other things. of course its none of my business what these young kids choose to spend their money on, but when they start expecting me to pay for their education, then it becomes my business.  Stop acting like an entitlement \textbf{brat} and accept that not everyone will agree with you. OOPS i forgot, you're a lefty. So i guess being entitled comes with the package.

When you put something out there it doesn't go away. I know that may be a little hard for you to comprehend given the fact that you were born in the '60s, but if you ask nicely, I won't have any problems holding your hand and explaining it to you. And you didn't have to respond to what I wrote. Yet you did and now here you are, projecting your insecurities and problems on to me because you can't accept who are. I would give you some numbers to people I know that are therapist and they would do it for free, but we know how you are about receiving hand outs. So I guess you should take your own advice and get off your ass and go pay for it yourself.And no, you can't do this forever.

It relies on cognitive bias and is presented less as; "everyone should give this some thought" and more as \textbf{age} \textbf{old} rhetoric of "kids these days".

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small There are some great points (and some harsh generalizations) inthis video. As a late millennial myself I see that the cellphone and Facebookdiscussion is extremely pertinent. We grew up in a technology environment. Thecomputer (AOL, chat rooms, email, etc) was a huge part of my upbringing. Thecell phone wasn't readily available and widespread until I was a late teenager,but as an adult today, I carry a cell phone wherever I go (and use it as myalarm clock!). However, blaming things on corporations and that it is thecorporation's responsibility to fix things is irrational. There is no way tochange an entire society's perception of their self-worth through actions theleadership needs to do for its employees. Doing so sets up an incorrectprecedence that individuals will then be able to find purpose in life (andoverall increased satisfaction) through coming to work every day to put food onthe table and if they don't feel like they are making an adequate impactthrough their actions it is the corporation's leaderships' fault. It is justshifting the blame onto someone who has absolutely \textbf{nothing} to do with theoriginal problem in the first place. Setting clear limits is something everyoneshould be doing (whether at work or in their personal lives) but this type ofvideo makes it seem like all millennials are some sort of cry baby, irrational,unappreciative, underprepared, ungrateful generation- and that is just not thecase. Millennials (especially younger ones) are a technology and instantgratification group of people- that I wholeheartedly agree with from the video.Except, I don't see it as all negative. Our society will never revert tonon-use of technology. It has brought us medical and life-saving miracles, efficiency,widespread dissemination of information (both good and bad) by the click of abutton, the ability to acquire needs/wants within hours to days, etc. Things inthis world are changed forever, and if we think that putting cell phones awaybefore and during a meeting will change the way people live (and havesatisfaction in) their lives then we are living in a fantasy world. We must beinnovators of how we can adapt the prior way of doing things to the ways of thefuture so that \textbf{old}, current, and future generations can be productive andfulfilled members of society. Times indeed are changing, and we must worktogether intergenerationally to plant seeds of prosperity and wellbeing for allinstead of placing blame and shifting responsibility to areas that areinappropriate.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nothing, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}2/425 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.471 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Dealt a bad hand?Let me tell you what a bad hand is, kids.FIRST our grandparents had to flee their homes in Western AND Eastern Europe because of World War I and starvation and no work.THEN our parents went through poverty, the depression, no food, no work, the Dust Bowl, etc.THEN World War II hit (FDR KNEW Japan was going to bomb Hawaii, but that's another history fact lesson) and our fathers and uncles and sometimes mothers and aunts (in factories and as pilots!) left for the Pacific and Europe and had NO communication sometimes for months if EVER from their families and were slaughtered at ages 16 (many lied about their ages to serve to send money home to poverty-stricken families), 17, 18.... to save our entire planet from totalitarianism, communism, wipe out of our culture, freedom of religion, etc, and imprisonment.  There is one reason why the world, and our \textbf{nation}, is in the complete melt-down it is in, and that is because God, Jesus Christ our Saviour has been taken out of our Judeo-Christian-founded culture and way of life. It started in the 60s, with those in power planting drugs into our culture, especially into the \textbf{black} neighborhoods to control them but it backfired, and through systematic, calculated worship of money and fame and 'talented entertainers, our generations have been ALLOWED to be raised to not believe in God, to be narcissistic and selfish, self-gratification presides over kindness to strangers and those in need. Our \textbf{nation} is free because of military men and women and God Almighty blessing us -- not many join the military today and thanks to an anti-Christian muslim who has been ignorantly allowed to sit in our White House, our military has been decimated and turned into a satanic-profering club where ministers and clergy are not allowed to discuss God, have Bible studies, Bibles on their desks, share services, \textbf{NOTHING}.  And this was all prophesied to happen.It's all about feelings now, which are fleeting and subjective. It's all about "ME! ME!"My parents' generation and not all of my generation did not turn our \textbf{nation} into what it has become today, a God-bashing, God-mocking, self-absorbed, entertain-me, what's-in-it-for-me, selfish, slovenly, disgusting idolization of the world and its products. That came from satan being allowed in and Jesus Christ our Lord being thrown out.  My generation had President Kennedy establishing the Peace Corps, of which hundreds of thousands of young people volunteered to go all over the world to help poverty-stricken people.  The generation since the 80s at large has their heads bent over texting while driving or walking and ignoring reality and embracing danger -- danger of losing their souls, their lives, many focused on simultaneous blaming older generations, God Almighty Himself and accumulating as much technology garbage as quickly as possible.The \textbf{old} saying, "If you think education is expensive, try ignorance" is not only plausible, it is factual, it is a reality. Where and what are you learning, young people?Because this all will pass away, disappear.  But Jesus's Words will never disappear.And time is running out.Choose wisely.  Choose Jesus Christ.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I agree with all but one thing this guy said: We millennials are not children.  We are adults.  In America, A child reaches adulthood at 18 (legally), but in many other cultures much sooner.  Our society needs to stop elongating childhood and thinking of adults as children.  A child is not at fault for being raised a certain way.  However, at what \textbf{age} does a "child" actually become an "adult?"  It is not so clear in our society.  At what \textbf{age} does a child pass into adulthood and claim responsibility for themselves and the situations of their life?   When is responsibility passed from the parents to the offspring? 18? 16? 13? 23?  People would say different things I think, but doesn't everyone agree that the mark of an adult is that they take responsibility for the circumstances surrounding their own life, actions, happiness, job, etc?  The truth is that in America, Millennials born before 1998 are ADULTS.  College students are ADULTS.  New graduates entering the job market are ADULTS.  It is not social media that is the problem, and it is certainly not a company's responsibility to teach an adult about communication (though any smart company will make this valuable investment in it's employees).  The truth is that each individual is responsible for themselves, for everything that they are, and for all of the circumstances that surround their lives.  People love to displace the blame.  They love to find reasons why an adult who is in a bad place in life is not responsible for themselves.  People blame their parents, significant others, politicians, the government, religion, science, social media, cell phones, technology, \textbf{alcohol}, drugs, \textbf{race}, \textbf{gender}, socioeconomic status, the illuminati, television, video games, fast food, the education system, the economy, the internet, other countries, God, Satan, liberals, conservatives, their boss, big business,...pretty much you name it and people will blame that thing for their problems.  The one thing that most adults won't admit is that their sucky life is their own goddamn fault.  The truth is, it is not all of these exterior things that are at fault.  It is just people.  People are at fault.  It is the responsibility of a person to find their own happiness and success.  And until an individual person looks at themselves and takes full responsibility for themselves in every way, that person will NEVER find happiness or reach their full potential.  Happiness can not be given to a person.  A person must claim it for themselves.  It must come from within.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Gender, Race, alcohol & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Behavioural Addiction - Alcohol, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}5/418 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.196 \\  \hline

You people are weak and a  bunch of entitlement pussies\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Faggot, Old, Sex & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Gender - General, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality & \cellcolor{green!5}3/113 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.655 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Alex Rodriguez Really because this guy is Gen X and he doesn't even know that millennials start in the early 1980's some studies believe millennials start in 1980 others think it starts in 1981 and some think it's 1984. But no one ever said millennial started in the 90's. Even this guy should have \textbf{common} sense and know when a generation is. It's the world in general that's losing any \textbf{common} sense. Hard work or employees don't matter anymore, rather than numbers and some random employee getting a promotion. You could be the best worker in your company and some mediocre employee could get a promotion instead of you. Some aspects of society is changing for the worse, and Gen X and Millennial aren't doing thing about it. Baby Boomers mostly run the government and they pass any law that comes there way. Trans need there own bathroom fine ok. The army can't yell anymore it's fine ok.  Ban the confederate flag government says ok. Baby Boomers Are mostly in charge of the government and they pass laws for any complaints. Then Gen X and Millennial are told they can constantly complain because it's perfectly fine. All three generations are at fault. Now there's Gen Z elementary though college who are completely involved in shitty social media. You know Facebook, YouTube, Twitch, Twitter, Instagram, kik, Snapchat. Everything that's making a person more of a shut in.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Common & \cellcolor{green!27}Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}2/236 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.847 \\  \hline
