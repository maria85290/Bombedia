I also find it odd that the \textbf{black} children picked the white dolls.

Some have been effective and are almost universally accepted, whereas others have failed and produced only shattered expectations, resentment, and interethnic hostility.

My mother always insisted I got the ones that looked like me. I didn't want to. Not because i don't think its bad, or ugly. I just liked how colorful the other ones were. But Brown was always brown.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I'm going to tell you how I learned about \textbf{racism} as a white person. As a child I suffered bullying at school from Gipsys. I didn't understand why they hated me so much. But now I know why they hated me it was because I was white and blonde. Gipsys have a darker skin color and were always miss treated and rejected from society. They were mean to me because they felt rejected. I grew hating on gypsys for the things they did to me but now as a grown up I understand it. So I don't hate them anymore.I think people should be more understanding with each other. Now I understand why Gipsys hated white people because we rejected them and we were unfair to them. They never had the same rights as white. They have their culture and way of living and it should be respected.Anyway as a white child I grew up feeling guilty for being white. Because I was always privileged or the favorite compared with kids of darker skin and I never felt it was right. I always had friends from other skin colours. For me in my eyes they were my friends but I did see others liking me more for being white. And I always felt bad. Anyway. Let's love people equally. We are all humans. Don't treat anyone bad for their skin colour. Enough of white favoritism.Even though I don't like white favoritism that doesn't mean I agree with \textbf{racism} against white. But as white we don't suffer that much \textbf{racism} as other colors.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Racism & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/265 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.132 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Nancy golf4life there is no truth in this 'test.' Kids use the color system to base negative and positive feelings. Adults do it as well. Darker colors are considered evil, scary, and dark natured. Hence why they are saying the \textbf{black} doll is bad because it's 'all \textbf{black}.'  Then when asked why the white doll is good the girl responds with 'because it has blue eyes.' Light colors are considered happy, tranquil, pleasant. When you paint a babies room do you paint it \textbf{black}, brown, dark green, or any other dark colors? No you don't. There is a reason for this. Different colors give off different emotions.

Mankind is close to the human in likeness. he has two arms, two legs and a head ( Arm, Leg, Leg, Arm, Head acronym: ALLAH ) but he lacks the property of "Hue" ( which is Melatonin produced by the penile gland giving you melanin color ) and surely a man of logic know's that you can't just give yourself an attribute that you don't possess. the European/mankind being able to withstand certain rays of light better today than in his days of cave dwelling is do to his knowledge of \textbf{black} genetic make up and of "HIMSELF". now food, water, ozone layers and many other things are used and developed by him in his struggle for survival.

He's not happy with his position when he compares himself to the human so he ( the white man ) destroys history, kills the character of the human. He understands that it would be better for him to live a lie because the truth is not within him. he has destroyed or tainted everything and everywhere on earth he's been. he is the natural enemy of all living things. 2000 years is \textbf{nothing} to a God made by the Almighty God/Gods. the white man has no history prior to the stone \textbf{age}. when he had no language, sleeping next to the dead, dwelling his caves living in his own urine and fecal matter, eating raw meat ( because he had no knowledge of fire ), drinking from dead animal skulls, parasites living on his body etc, the Egyptians on the other side of the world had master mathematics, carpentry, tool building, astrology, the wheel, language to communicate, signs and symbols, mummification ( which is doctoring and surgery procedures ). there's just no comparison but in the white man's mind he wants to be as good or if not better than God and this is do to his lack of connection to the universe and God himself. Everything God says not to do the white man says it's okay and makes a law that says you can yet wants others to go by Gods words as though he's exempt.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Arvind Emmanuel: i totally agree with you. and what makes it so bad is that the original "Human" has taken on the ways of "Mankind." most say ( and think ) well, same thing. mankind is just a way to say all humans on earth making up mankind as one but no. I beg to differ. Mankind is close to the human in likeness. He has two arms, two legs, and a head ( Arm, Leg, Leg, Arm, Head, acronym: ALLAH ) but he ( mankind ) lacks the property of "Hue" and you can't just give yourself an attribute that you don't possess. this is one of 3 of the most hidden secrets to the world that's right in our faces. the Human is the only one that can produce multicolored races. This is not just by chance. God did this so that we could live forever and so could he through us. Mankind does not have this ability. Even when God said, "let there be light," it came from within triple blackness, void, \textbf{nothing}. as the tree that bares \textbf{fruit} is within the seed beneath the darkness of earth. it shall bring an abundance of life. that's the difference between human and mankind.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Fruit, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality & \cellcolor{green!27}2/205 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.976 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small It's really depressing to see how kids point at \textbf{black} doll saying it's the bad one. Just because it's darker. Even worse is seeing them knowing that they are looking alike (if we're talkin bout skin tone). Each person is beautiful and the colour of the skin doesn't define the person. Of course, it all started with the european people travelling to find another lands and then to get slaves for the rich people. But we're not Living in those years, where having a slave was great and being darker skin tone was telling people that you are a slave. We're Living in the times when we should know, that we're all equal. And if the kids start thinking like this "I'm \textbf{black} and i'm equal to the white guys, i'm as beautiful as them, cause we all are" then they'll tell the same thing their kids.

It does matter however, with what intention and in what kind of context it was used. I'm aware that the meaning of a word changes with the context, for example among friends, certain swearwords might not be used as actual swearwords. But to draw the line not by social context and intention, but by skine tone of the speaker? That's kind of \textbf{racist}. And begs the question, how dark must your skin tone be, for you to be able to use this offensive word without being considered offensive? Is it gradual, like the darker your skin the less offensive the n-word suddenly becomes? Maybe it's because I'm not living in the US and my social environment cares less about "\textbf{race}", but using offensive words and yet being upset if others do as well, seems hypocritical to me.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Wow. I think what should be done is parents need to express that everyone is good, beautiful and pretty no matter what color/\textbf{race} they are! No one is born bad, that too should be addressed by parents! To children, they look to their parents to teach them what is correct, what is good, what is bad, etc. When i started having children it was a priority for me to explain how everyone is beautiful, good, kind, etc and color/\textbf{race} doesn't matter!!! I see every human being, every \textbf{race}, color or creed as beautiful! It is how we are raised (by our parents or the system) that makes us different, divided, etc. If \textbf{racist} parents bring their children up to be \textbf{racist} then that's what you'll get. However, if parents that have no \textbf{racism} in them bring up children without \textbf{racist} crap then you will have kids that do not see differences in color or \textbf{race}! Bad people become bad by what they see, usually by the parents. Yes, it is the parents responsibility to raise their children rightly!

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Racism is one of those unusual things which seem to escape the understanding of clear and to the point definition. \textbf{Racism} is a system of racial discrimination and prejudice. The concept of \textbf{race} as classifying people can be seen as misleading people and prejudicial as far as it's involved in the quality of human life. The term \textbf{race} has been quite confusing because of its four principle connotations.¬†1. Physical anthropologists have called races the various subspecies of the human \textbf{race} characterized by certain phonotypical and genotypic traits.¬†2. Laymen have profusely used the word \textbf{race} to describe a human group that shares certain cultural characteristics such as language or religion.3.¬†‚Ä¶show more content‚Ä¶¬†\textbf{Racism} is never pushed to the side. For example when a white law school student at Georgetown reported that \textbf{black} students were not as qualified as white students, it made a big controversy about \textbf{racism}. If the student would have murdered some one it would have caused less attention. \textbf{Racism} is an obsession. Universities are always on top of it, newspapers and politicians reject it, churches are against it, and America is strained with it.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Insurance Fund of New York made a company pamphlet in which she explains that all whites are \textbf{racist} and that only whites can be \textbf{racist}.(Thomas Jackson, What is \textbf{Racism}? PublishedAlthough some blacks and liberal whites acknowledge that non ‚Äì whites have been forced into it as self defense because of centuries of white oppression. What would be called \textbf{racism} when done by whites is thought to be normal when done by any one else. The opposite is also true.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†At a few college campuses, students that disagree with affirmative action have set up a student union for whites, analogous to those for blacks, Hispanics, etc, and have been accused of being racists.

When she showed me, I was a bit suprised at the fact that it was a \textbf{black} doll, because that was the only one of it's kind she had, plus she usually picked out the white dolls, because thats all you'd see in the toy sections of stores.I ended up finding out that her mother let her pick out a toy because she had been good that week, and when they were walking through the toy section, the dolls caught her eye- and it didn't take long for her to gravitate to the \textbf{black} one. She told her mother she wanted that one. Her mother asked "Are you sure you want this one ? You don't want a different one...?" she had her sights set on the one she picked. Then her mother asked "Why do you want this one ?" She said "Because she's pretty." Then her mother asked "Well, she's different then the other dolls you have, is that okay ?" She replied with "Yea!

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small That would be a good idea for representation of all races, however, this study was designed to assess how \textbf{black} children are affected by systematic \textbf{racism}. The study may have to be altered or the questions reworded to accommodate for white children to participate (research is complex as hell). Additionally, researchers typically don't conduct studies with populations where they already know the results. How many white children would deviate from their systematic racial "superiority" and say that the \textbf{black} doll is the good one? It is fairly reasonable to assume that if minority children think that \textbf{black} dolls are bad, they've learned this from their peers, white, \textbf{black}, Asian, Latino, Native American, etc. We live in a society (that carries across various cultures) that prioritizes white culture and light skin. Because of this, there is little need to assess if white children believe they are less than \textbf{black} children. The systematic \textbf{racism} that has manifested over hundreds of years is still very much the reality for schoolchildren. We can only hope that one day these kids will say they are both good until proven otherwise, but that day has yet to come.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Racism & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}7/192 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.646 \\  \hline

By asking these questions especially in this sort of position makes them feel uncomfortable your basically interrogating the poor things when they want to go run around screaming or talking to there friends so of course there going to look sad. Its cruel and It's clear that they where just trying to say the right thing by the fact that a) half of them had to think about it before they answered and b) that boy lost confidence in himself half way through and started changing his answers. By asking them these questions your putting ideas in their head that there is something wrong with them. Stop it! Is this not a test for \textbf{black} 'Americans' if it isn't then I apologise for this next point but \textbf{black} people make up about 13 of the population in america so surely its more likely for them to see white kids and therefore theres a higher chance of seeing a white kid that they think is pretty than a \textbf{black} kid.

Do not get angry at me this is historical fact! and slavery is found in  every culture of humans white or not . Europe is not the same as the united states culturally socially or historically . In america we need to get over slavery all of us white or \textbf{black} and stop feeling guilty or ashamed. the institution of slavery has been committed to our  past for the last 153 years( in this country at least) if we want to move on and progress as a society we can not keep squabbling about what has already past and we need to stop appropriating history either to suite the delicate sensibilities of bleeding hart leftist liberals and ultra right conservatives ! have a nice day .

So no, you really don't need a doll to help children appreciate white people; society already does that for you.Not that I think the type of doll you give to your kids is going to be what makes the overall difference on how they treat others - dolls are just a good way of revealing what attitudes kids absorb from the world around them - but please take a moment to think about how you sound when you hijack a comment made by a \textbf{black} \textbf{woman} encouraging other \textbf{black} parents to teach their kids how to love themselves, and try making that post about you.

The notion that we have, conscious or unconscious is that anyone looks better with European features added to them.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small White supremacy is real. I remember long ago, I was a waitress at a restaurant. A mother (\textbf{African}) mother and her daughter was sitting in a booth, the little girl was playing with a white blonde haired blue eyed doll. A white \textbf{woman} was looking, basically staring at them. She FINALLY WALK OVER to them and said, oh my what a beautiful baby doll you're playing with.. The mother grinned and smiled and directed her daughter to thank the nice lady for the compliment. After they were leaving she (the mother) walks over to me, tips me and says I get so many compliments for this doll. She said you have a daughter I said yes, she said you should get your daughter one, I said no, I don't teach my daughter to hate her self. All my daughter dolls are brown. She got mad, said I don't teach my child \textbf{racism}, I said I didn't say you were. But self hate sure seems to be the lesson for the day. I told her  I don't teach my children in order to love yourself you must hate someone else.. But I do teach them to be proud of yourself, to embrace and treasure the beauty God gave you. To be strong enough to call yourself on your own Bullsht. Never lie to yourself and expect others to be truthful. The world is ironic. Even pathological liars wants to be told the truth. Even murders wants to live. And even thieves  wants honesty. To hate someone you do not know, you are PROJECTING YOUR OWN SELF HATE UNTO ANOTHER.. You can only hate yourself because you don;t take accountability, responsibility for yourself. Your actions, who you are. .

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I think the reason why most white people...well, not all white people...but i think they hate or at least hated almost all \textbf{black} people because they think \textbf{black} people are ugly. Let us just admit. Please don't lie. And some \textbf{black} people have been made to think they are ugly and useless and that is why they try bleaching...whatever. But that is no reason to hate anyone coz of what they did not choose to be but they are anyway.I also heard the news that \textbf{black} people were cursed coz they betrayed someone, you will know who. I heard that they are the true Israelites or Hebrews but they don't know it. That to me means that someone changed history and made it upside down. You know that means that Africa is Israel and one of these other continents must be the ancient home of the Egyptians. So today's known Israelites are the Egyptians, and the modern Egyptians were the Israelites! This means that today's Egypt, the country, was Israel, and today's Israel was Egypt or something. Am not completely sure about this but who knows? \textbf{Nobody} knows. Even if they prove that from the bible, most people do not believe the bible is true. You know that means the bible was written by Africans but the white people took it and made it their own, imagining that Jesus is white, drawing His pictures appearing like a white angel, even when the same bible says do not make any graven image on earth or in heaven and worship it, then they came back for the gold, diamonds and slaves and returned the bible coz. I don't know.  And these people say you know the Israelites were slaves in Egypt, Jesus had eyes like fire, skin of bronze, hair like sheep's wool...so he was \textbf{black}...or brown...whatever. then they say it is written that the Israelites disobeyed God, and so He cursed them to be slaves even in their own lands and in strange lands they would be taken into while being spread all over the world, serving and singing to their masters, their wealth taken, changing names, children killed, wives taken or raped...whatever, maybe they are forcing us to bleach so that we appear like them too, I mean look at the salons, straight hair, wigs, weaves. You know i think the bible is right, but i am not sure if it is talking about \textbf{black} people coz there is no word \textbf{black} in the bible...or maybe it might be there to represent the devil. I don't know for sure. \textbf{Black} ppl might be the first people on earth, you know, not the way Darwin puts it, but look it this way, it is evident that \textbf{black} people are the most disunited \textbf{race} people unlike other races, and that is seen in the bible where people unite to against God and build the tower of Babel, and later on disunity comes in between them, God changed their languages, they couldn't understand each other. Which \textbf{race} of people do you think these people are today? Who are the most disunited ppl today? I mean, look at all these tribes among the \textbf{black} people, look at Africa, in my country, Kenya, there are at least 42 tribes, what about the whole of Africa! There must be thousands of tribes and languages. But now look at the united races, i made it look like an organization didn't i? The UR, or United Races. You know the white people, most of them just speak English, French...you can count the languages, not more than fifty, and that is one thing that kept them united besides the colour. Coz i think \textbf{racism} didn't just emerge due to colour diversity alone, it must have been the language also, and the Europeans didn't understand the feelings of these Africans coz imagine beating someone up and he or she starts singing a sweet song...to you the song is sweet coz of its elements except the language. Little do you know that it is a sad song and that person is hurting or mourning. But you couldn't understand their feelings coz they didn't tell you in your language. It all started with the difference in languages. You kick someone and they cry cursing in their own language and you don't understand, and so, you just keep on. Today, there is a little unity even between many races coz of the power of language. People say i don't care abt your colour coz I understand and feel what you are saying. You know, you are one of us coz you speak French, otherwise al kill you. I think 80 of the world today speaks English. Human rights have been made universal coz they are written in English or some popular language. But it should be that human rights are universal coz I don't know. Maybe someone will tell me the truth, or av also been told but i don't believe it. But anything is possible. Also, people believe anything that they perceive as true, so someone might have changed some things somewhere along the line. You know it is evident even today the way technology has the power to dictate too many about what is true or not. You have seen fictional movies that you feel the superheroes are real but are not physically, or the hacking, feck photos, videos...everything. But there is no one to blame but ourselves‚Ä¶sometimes when people blame you, you should also blame yourself so that when you correct the mistakes, the same people will come back to you or support you that way. But you should never blame yourself because of someone else' mistakes even when they claim that you influenced themI think many \textbf{black} people like tattoes on their skin just to show white people the difference between \textbf{black} and brown/chocolate. They r like we are not \textbf{black} after all, if we were, you wouldn't see any tattoes on our bodies. But I don't like tattoes, what for. If you want to write something \textbf{nigga}, just take a paper men, or a book and write it down. Niggas be writing their whole fuckin stories on their bodies, al be like turn over \textbf{nigga} I want to see the next paragraph‚Ä¶you mean it is on your ass, no‚Ä¶I don't want to see it then‚Ä¶let me take it as a dilemma. Lil wayne men, his whole thug life is written on his body, you see tears‚Ä¶that is when he was raped‚Ä¶that is the first paragraph men.When the colonizers came to Africa, they were united and focused on taking all the gold, diamond, silver and other minerals. Christianity was spread in Africa and many converted. But when the colonizers took the minerals and slaves, back at their homes they became divided, and started World War 1 and ww2. The minerals they took together are the same minerals they used to make weapons to fight each other later on. The slaves worked in plantations and the transportation of the minerals to make weapons for their masters to slain each other. United they came, divided they left. Reminds me of the bible saying the enemies of the Israelites will come upon thee in one way but will flee in seven ways if the Israelites accept God again. After the white people finished killing \textbf{black} people, they began fighting each other. Russia, Germany against France, USA, and Britain‚Ä¶.they killed each other so much and it remains evident in japan, Vietnam, and china. Now, it is the Arabs against the Caucasians, they were both colonizers of \textbf{black} people. \textbf{Black} people never hated nor fought the whites so much, that is why God decided that those filled with hatred and the urge to kill to hate and kill each other.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Nigga, Nobody, Race, Racism & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}22/1299 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.694 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Chase Change..... That example is not based on an assumption, it's based on facts. I am pointing out that just like different species are not interchangeable so are human races but from a societal and cultural point of view. For starters the most basic definition of a culture is: "the social behavior and norms found in human societies" - WikipediaDifferent groups of people or races have different cultures as a whole. There are of course the occasional outliers that can easily assimilate in a western society but that is not the case for the group as an aggregate. For proof of that you don't need to look any further than American blacks, they commit far more crime than whites, they have significantly less economic output than whites, they don't believe in the values that have helped build the west etc. They simply don't have the same culture as whites despite the fact that they have lived in the USA for hundreds of years. They are the perfect example that groups of people are not interchangeable.As for your example of the British and the French both being Canadians, I would agree that this is indeed true but that is the case because they are very simmilar \textbf{ethnic} groups and so the differeces between those groups are much smaller than between the races.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small No, it's not. Institutional \textbf{racism} cannot possibly be from \textbf{black} to white because white people in most European and North American countries control a much larger percentage of the wealth and positions of power. If you feel like white people are suffering from institutional \textbf{racism} then it stands to reason that it is not the \textbf{black} person doing it to you but the person who controls the greatest number of institutions in your country. A \textbf{black} person might tell you-you're an asshole, but that won't get you arrested and shot by a cop for standing somewhere unarmed, that won't get you forced out of a job for being white, that won't get you denied loans, that won't get your children kicked out of certain schools because their hair is different, that won't make all of the people around you assume that you are on welfare, that won't get you pulled over for the crime of driving a car and harassed. Sure it might upset you a little bit, but overall it won't actually hurt you one way or another. If all of the things I mentioned stopped happening to the \textbf{black} person that called you an asshole for being white, for a long enough period of time to rebuild trust then they probably wouldn't call you an asshole at all. The fact is it is still happening and people are still being defined as a skin color and not people and it's not because of "\textbf{Black} People" that that is happening, as long as it does happen however people will be angry at you because you are no different than any other white person according to a society run by people who are obsessed with those labels.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I don't think that these young children are 'racist,' and I don't want to start a racial feud in the comments so if you don't want to hear me than please scroll on. I think that most children chose the white doll, not because they're 'racist,' but because the doll simply looks brighter. Be honest. If you saw a white figure or \textbf{black} figure both leading you in two different directions, which one looks brighter and more trustworthy? As kids, you'll want the 'nicer looking' option, and I don't meant that the \textbf{black} doll is ugly, but it's just darker and kids are attracted to a lighter looking one.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I believe that most modern television is filled with people with white skin, such as superheroes or things that the kid would look up to.

So, when a kid at school is \textbf{black} and everyone else is white, they think they're the ones that are different, and aren't good or cannot fit in with them as seen on social media.

Hades was bad and was in a dark enviroment plus his clothes and looks were dark and Zeus was pure white heavens and stuff, and Hercules beat hades to try to get into Olympus so in that movie the colors sceem was light = good dark = bad.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small That is precisely the point. \textbf{Black} is seen as bad white is seen as good. The \textbf{black} baby is bad, the white baby is good.

The Asian kid identified himself with the \textbf{black} doll after claiming its the bad one, because he doesn't consider himself as the social norm (white) He thinks hes different, and society makes sure he feels different, I say this because Asian kids are the most likely to be bullied in western cultures.You think this doesn't have any implications? Won't that effect these children's way of thinking in all sorts of ways as they reach adulthood?Oh btw, I have no issue with white people so don't misunderstand what I'm saying, I'm just an Asian boy who's experienced discrimination throughout his childhood.

That being said, heterosexual  white males all over the world have an ingrained fear of men that are darker \textbf{colored}.(Generally speaking) If you would take some time and research world history this would present itself over and over again.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Racism  self hate or hating others is a culturally learnt behaviour, set of beliefs. You have to understand and believe this before you can unlearn it.

There is no epigenetic explanation for hate. There is no back door escape for hate.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Raquel Paterson I have the answer for you maybe: cause 'nero' (it literally means \textbf{black} in Italian) is often used as an insult here in Italy, cause using color to define someone it's not normal here. You can't go around saying 'hey, \textbf{black}' 'hey, asian' or 'hey, white' cause ppl will assume you're a \textbf{racist}. We're really far from the U.S.A. where ppl use '\textbf{black}' 'white' or 'asian' to proudly describe theirselves (And honestly that's something i understand now that i'm studying American culture). If i say 'you're \textbf{black}' to an American person that's probably not an offense, it's just who they are and how they identify theirselves, but if someone says the same here... well, he/she is \textbf{racist} and he/she is saying that your color means you're different (bad), they probably think you're poor and something other stupid things racists people think (i'm not \textbf{racist}, so everything i said, it' something i heard before). The thing that makes me cry as an Italian \textbf{woman} is that, that girl thinks '\textbf{black}' is bad. No. \textbf{Black} is not bad. She's beautiful. But She doesn't want to be called '\textbf{black}' cause she knows that that guy is making a difference between her and him. She said she doesn't want to be called \textbf{black} cause kids made fun of her before. And that's the problem. She's just a kid who wants to be like everybody else around her. She doesn't want to be called \textbf{black} because she doesn't want to be seen as different compared to other kids. I'm not saying we need to use words like '\textbf{black}' and 'white' for everything we do like Americans do, cause we still think it's \textbf{weird} and it's not in our history and in our culture to do something like that, but we should tell our kids that yes, we can be white, \textbf{black} or asians but it doesn't matter cause we're all humans. Sorry for my english, i'm trying to learn it üòÖ. P.s. I still don't like the American typical conversation where people will say something like ' So, you're white and you probably like this/that'... that's offensive and \textbf{weird} to me, but i repeat, i'm not American so it's just about cultural differences. In the U.S.A. ppl seem to have many stereotypes about being 'white', '\textbf{black}' or 'asian' and i honestly don't like it.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Racist, Weird, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}11/391 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.813 \\  \hline

You will get the same results.   All this test does, is show how stupid psychology has gotten over the years and how stupid the creators of the test were.   They didn't think about the primal fears of Humanity and the mind set of a child.

YOU better wake up and get that crap out of your head saying white women are perttier than \textbf{black} women. Everyone is beautiful in their own way.

It doesn't matter if someone may have better clothes than you, better hair than you, better body than you, heck. You don't even know how they got it. Comparison is the thief of joy. If you compare yourself, you will never be happy. And I believe that's something that we deserve, happiness. But how can we have happiness when we be acting like fools, cussing ppl out for no reasons and just disrespecting ppl with hurtful opinions. We talk about unity, but this is what we get. Guys, we need to stop fighting. I'm sure your getting tired of all this mess. It's 2018, and we be acting like smart-asses and being \textbf{racist}. \textbf{Racism} shouldn't even be a thing.

When you think of a nice color be honest with yourself \textbf{witch} color comes to mind \textbf{black} or whiteand now think this as a child when 99 of you are afraid of the dark wouldn't it be natural to like white more than \textbf{black}?2. This was based on what skin color they were either way! When the kids chose what doll they liked they usually picked the color they are most familiar with.For example: statistics show that \textbf{black} men marry \textbf{black} women more then white women and white men usually marry white women more then \textbf{black} women so I can make a guess that most of these kids have same \textbf{race} parents.

I get that left wings are radical and all but that doesn't excuse you from devaluing \textbf{racism} as if it isn't a problem because it is. Believe me when I say this, children are not born with this mindset, it is influenced by the people they see on TV and what they normally see around them.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small While the results of this study are indeed disturbing, it's important to keep in mind that it is not without flaws.¬† First, \textbf{black} has traditionally been associated with evil in most societies, while white is associated with goodness and purity.¬† (Even the Bible uses darkness as a symbol of evil and light as a symbol for good.)¬† This association is not so much \textbf{race} based as it is of color psychology and the values that different cultures have assigned to colors.¬† Likewise, dark colors are traditionally associated with negative feelings, especially sadness, while light colors are associated with positive feelings like happiness or excitement.¬† It is easy to see why someone who doesn't know better may, at first sight, assume that \textbf{black} people are bad and white people are good based on these color associations.¬† Second, the researchers seemed to make the kids choose one doll¬†or the other for each category.¬† If they had been given a choice for whether to answer the questions and had been allowed they had no preference, the results may have been much different.¬† I, for one, did not consider either doll to be especially pretty or ugly, good or bad (and FTR, I am white.)¬† If anything, it is more \textbf{racist} to make kids choose a "good" or "bad" doll simply based on the doll's \textbf{race}, since there is really no other visible measure of difference between the two of them.Does¬†experiment outcomes like this¬†demonstrate internalized \textbf{racism}?¬† Possibly.¬† But it could be for a million other reasons as well.¬† Let's not jump to conclusions until more detailed research can be done.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Race, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}6/270 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.222 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The experiment seems to have the same results everywhere and at all times in predominantly white societies. Would be interesting to perform the experiment in predominantly \textbf{coloured} societies. I suspect, that you would get reverse results. Explanation: Most people are more comfortable when part of the majority because they want to belong.Belonging to a minority is naturally perceived as undesirable with many mammals. They want to belong to the pack, tribe, flock swarm, group forming the majority. And physical appearance - including skin colour - is a major classification attribute. \textbf{Racist} or not.Minority pride is learned at a later date - typically during puberty - and often expresses a rebellious attitude against group pressure felt as repressive.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Racist, coloured & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/119 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.681 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Unfortunately, i doubt the result would be much different.I have Jamaican family, whenever i visit i am told  'you are so light(I'm mixed \textbf{race}), you're so pretty' by my younger, darker cousins.Lighter skin is associated with wealth and class whilst darker is associated with poverty and negativity.Assimilation is a good theory but  I think overall class(the 'richer' people in India where, for example, the morthey would stay inside, thus the lighter they would be etc) , colonialism and American-centric beauty standards are all factors as to why people perceive lighter as better.From Senegal to South Korea people bleach, so their children learn through example lighter is better.Whilst south africa is 79.6 \textbf{Black} , 77 of it's magazines have white models ect.Tragic but true.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/123 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.626 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Well either way, predominantly \textbf{coloured} societies have suffered the effects of long term colonization by white people which effectively means that they are still going to see dark skin as dirty/bad.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small And since this is in Italian and I visited there and some country's in the vicinity let me give you this example. Although they are considered both white Europeans.Italians even though they have a darker complexion than Albanians are \textbf{racist} towards them.        This "\textbf{racism}" developed during their flight from \textbf{communist} Albania Italy took many of them in. They caused a lot of havoc then robberies etc etc they were poor and desperate. Wind the clock 15 years the kids of these Albanian migrants assimilated and adopted quick now they make 30 of the top students. Most Albanian families nowadays are hardworking and honorable yet the stereotype created during those years still persists. But there is hope...I heard Italians say. "Lui he Albanese ma he una brava persona!" Not to mention the shock they get when they visit the country and get all their prejudiced SMASHED, which is golden just to see their expressions. So smth is changing. But this came because Albanians started to clean their ACT.It has \textbf{nothing} to do with \textbf{race} but with behavior and portrayal and of course not to forget the media who is constantly responsible for these kind of stereotypes.If you behave like an savage people will dislike you, stereotypes get created and than \textbf{racism} flourishes. AfroBlacks need to change their behavior and reject their gangster culture or they will never be treated with respect and this is detrimental for their \textbf{mental} well-being also because it creates an inferiority complex. This is my hopeful advice because the alternative would mean that there must be some sort of natural hierarchy and thats a dangerous thing because it leads to dehumanization and we know all to well where that ends.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Communist, Mental, Nothing, Race, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}7/286 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.448 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small This is just ridiculous and utterly stupid.  All this means is that those who picked the opposite color are intelligent children. The smart ones  crave the different the unexplored the other the not so smart ones pick the familiar the known. Its as simple stop making this a \textbf{race} issue because its not. As for the "good and bad" maybe the kids are smarter than you think in that regard too, maybe they interpret the behaviors of these groups better than we adults.In another test a Latino kid hit the nail on the head, "Because I am not afraid of white people! I trust them more." The other said "Because HE (dark doll) hits others!". This is no racial bias these is stereotyping according to behaviors they see in these groups.Maybe we should turn the attention on our-self and how we behave in front of kids rather than making this a political \textbf{race} issue. There are also other psychological dimensions. We accosiate \textbf{black} and white with the cold unknown dangerous night and white with warm clear and known security of the day. This does not mean thats because of \textbf{race}. And you cant beat the day the white the sun out of people no matter the skin-color. My sun loves Asian girls and Latino his best friend has a dark skinned wife we are European. Get a grip mfg.... and even IF there may be some innate bias what should we do?! Segregate the races?! Send them back to Africa?! Lower academical standards?! (we already have affirmative action, but i would never go to a \textbf{black} doctor) If this is innate bias than there is no way that other races would want to mix with \textbf{black} skinned people because they dont find em good or attractive."Best way to get rid of \textbf{racism} is STOP TALKING ABOUT \textbf{RACISM}" Morgan FreemanAll this is doing is furthering the gap antagonizing one another and giving \textbf{black} people a bad inferiority complex and envy. Blacks should learn to behave not only in front of kids but in every area, being poor doesn't make one a gangster.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Tiffany Davis That is so true, and I totally agree with you especially about the TV shows and movies. The main characters shown are usually white in almost every film and if there is a tv show with \textbf{black} main characters, they are usually portrayed as ghetto or thugs, whether it's the way they speak or even their lifestyle. I think it's because white is seen as 'normal'. I live in a country where \textbf{racism} is not surprising or out of the ordinary, but I feel that many white people who also don't consider themselves \textbf{racist} are \textbf{racist} without knowing it. I wanted to be an actress but if I were to audition for a main role in the movie, they'd be forced to change the whole concept of the film because along with the skin color also comes the \textbf{black} personality traits that 'every' \textbf{black} person 'should have'. My point is, white people seem to have the power to be whoever they want in tv shows or movies, but with \textbf{black} people, it'd just seem odd having a \textbf{black} person in 'that main role'.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}8/185 & \cellcolor{green!5}4.324 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Blake Steele I was fortunate enough to grow up with a lot of different races so I was always staunchly against \textbf{racism}, but it wasn't until college that I learned how pervasive and insidious it really is. In Malcolm X's autobiography, he says that white people have this deep-seated \textbf{racism} that has been latched onto their core. I agree with him. As much as I advocate for equality, I sometimes find myself  (very rarely) thinking something \textbf{racist}. It usually happens when I am angry, and it lasts about 2 seconds before logic takes over. These knee-jerk reactions scare me. \textbf{Racism} really HAS dug itself deep into the fiber of my being, and I can rationalize it away with my intellect, but I still hate that it rears its unwanted ugly head from time to time.I can give you an example of this. If I am walking down a dark street at night, and on one side there are a bunch of white teenage males and on the other, there are a group of \textbf{black} teenage males, I may subconsciously believe that the latter is more dangerous even though I know that this is an unfair assessment. I am taught to believe this by the news, movies, etc. I then quickly snap out of it, and remember the insidious nature of \textbf{racism}.You can say that I have white guilt. I sure as hell do. I hate any moment of the day that I am not advocating against \textbf{racism} because as long as I am benefiting from white privilege and not doing anything about promoting equality,    I am just as bad as anyone who is promoting \textbf{racism}. That is why I now take to the streets to protest for equality. I will fight for equality when I have conversations with peers. I will keep putting a spotlight on all of the injustices that are done to minorities. I will keep educating myself on all the ways that the institution of \textbf{racism} confers dominance to one group while disadvantaging others.I have to keep doing this because I will feel horrible about myself if I don't. American meritocracy doesn't exist. Primary schools lie to us about history. Most white people don't act against \textbf{racism} because they simply don't know. They really believe it's over or soley exists in individual acts of meanness. That is what many white people are taught to believe, and I will continue to feel guilty unless I enlighten others about the truth.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}10/415 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.41 \\  \hline

If the children are only offered two answers to "which one of these dolls bad" they're going to have to search for differences between the dolls, the only difference being skin color, and make their judgement based on that. When asked which one was good, maybe they picked white because their favorite Disney princess is white, or maybe they picked their own \textbf{race} because it reminds them of everyone in their family, but either way they formed some association with "This is the good color."

At one point in every little \textbf{black} childs life they want to be white, why? Its because of how you see white people as princesses, princes, kings and queens. And you only see blacks on tv as thugs and gangsters. And I promise you, your child has heard the "N" word before he stepped on that playground.

Think beyond what the video editors obviously wants you to conclude. You can see the \textbf{mental} shift that takes place in the children, it is almost tangible. There are various methods to teaching and these "people" are TEACHING the children to identify themselves and others with the negative attributes and stereotypes they hear about and see in their story books, cartoons, posters and even the misguided adults around them. Something similar was done to me as a child and it took me years to overcome when, by GOD, I finally realized what was done to me. The children want to get the answers "right" and they take cues from the tone of voice and the facial expressions of the adult asking the questions and even the cues presented in the room, hallway and environment immediately prior to the interview which are not shown to the viewer. You are absolutely right the sensitive, trusting and sponge like minds of children  quickly"pick up" on these authoritative cues. Even though the words are beguilingly phrased as questions they are actually statements and the children "pick up" on that. Similar to the way a parent states in an authoritative tone, "should you leave your toys laying on the floor?" it' phrased as a question but isn't really and because of the tone of the adults voice, the child knows he did something wrong and what the "right answer" i.e. the answer the adult wants to hear is.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Mental & \cellcolor{green!27}Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}1/263 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.38 \\  \hline
