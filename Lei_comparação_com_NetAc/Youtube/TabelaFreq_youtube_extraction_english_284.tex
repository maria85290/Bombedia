\hline\cellcolor{green!27}\small I thought we all knew by now that the State of Israel is putting a lot of money into buying support in the US political system, and probably the UK onetoo. Also they very intentionally conflate anti-Israel State, through a highly structured lobby, with anti-Semitism with the express intention of smearing those that might dare to criticise their apartheid activities towards the Palestinians, amongst other nefarious actions. And this includes the Labour Party and Jeremy Corbyn. Criticising a government of any political persuasion is NOT rascist, and never has been! Just watch The Lobby (UK version), with secretly recorded footage of a guyworking out of the Israeli Embassy, if it hasn't been taken down yet.Absolutely no-one should receive any kind of vilification for \textbf{race} or religion, but neither should this be weaponised!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Race & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/135 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.741 \\  \hline

And this should not be called Antisemitism as then the whole humanity will all become \textbf{racist}.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small John Smith I have to hand it to them. It's a strategy of sorts, conceal your \textbf{racism} by accusing anti-racists of being \textbf{racist}. It's not too disimilar to pedophiles acting high and mighty against other proven pedophiles or acting like they are the saviours and protectors of children. It's the  only chance they have to smoke screen their corruption.But the world is getting wise to the trickery. As these deflectionary false accusations against Momentum get more and more press time, the sweet irony is that they are getting plenty of promotion and those who are on the side of consistent morality are realising on an ever increasing scale that Momentum and this reformed Labour party is where the progressives are flocking.No such thing as bad press. ;)\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/129 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.55 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small John Smith - its simple really. We are commenting on a video relating to antisemitism. Where there is no mention of Israel. You made a choice to not give support to the speaker and instead justify antisemitism because of your personal belief that Israel has acted in a \textbf{racist} way. Maybe I am mistaken and you feel a sympathy for the Jewish people.

Of course you could say I don't have to prove anything however this would imply that you are indeed a pathetic antisemtic \textbf{racist} fool.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/59 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.39 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small daniel reed - Let's get a few things straight.At no point in this thread did I state, imply or infer that Israel does not have the right to exist. I have simply inferred so far that Israel carries out its existence in a manner which has displaced a large percentage of the former population of Palestine and acts in an egregious manner towards them. This is well documented. I only brought it up as you had already started on the subject of Israel.As for Berger, no one should be subjected to any sort of abuse based on their religion or \textbf{race}. If I worked with a Jewish colleague in the workplace and they were subjected to personal abuse, obviously I would report it. I also think Holocaust denial should be treated as hate speech. Where I draw the line is when people like yourself cry \textbf{racist} as soon as they hear or read anyone referring negatively to political Zionism and Israel's policies. You are guilty of that.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Race, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/169 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.183 \\  \hline

\textbf{\Large Result analysis:}

\begin{itemize}\item Taking into account the words that were detected, we can reach the conclusion these comments are associated with : : Ethnicity - General;Age - Youngsters;Age - Over 65s;Nationality - European or anti-Europeans;Sexual Identity - General;Ethnicity - Native-American; Ideological and Political Identity - General;Gender - General;Ethnicity - Black;Social Class - Working class;Religious Identity - Muslim;Gender - Female sexuality;Age - General;Physical Identity - Physical Features;Nationality - General;Nationality - German;Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments;Nationality - French;Religious Identity - Jewish;Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality;%.

\item The percentage of hate speech related words is 1.157.

\item Considering that the variable \textbf{Ethnicity - General} has the most occurences in the post, we can interpret that this is the predominant hate speech.

\item Overall there were 182/695 occurences of hate speech related comments.\end{itemize}\end{document}
