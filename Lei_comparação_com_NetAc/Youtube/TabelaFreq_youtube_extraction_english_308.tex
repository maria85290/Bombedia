  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Ditto on the last sentiment.  Who allowed that pair of hipster (well the girl was not really a hipster) cretins to self congratulate themselves and slap each other on the back.  The problem with an opening like that is that you are introduced to a pair of complete narcissist wankers.  After which I could not really listen to either of them.  It was a struggle to listen to the other contributors after that.    I think the other two speakers were well informed and well-meaning, but their conclusions sounded to me like they wanted to address the issues of \textbf{nationalism} by "fixing" it.  Instead of merging it into whatever shape the EU comes forth.  They seemed to be the typical "do-gooder"  type.  My take on the whole thing is that \textbf{Nationalism} can still exist in this world and EU makeup.  \textbf{Nationalism} has only in the last 10 years become a dirty word put forth by leftist types who don't know that what they are referring to is jingoism and not \textbf{nationalism}. You will always have fringe elements in any democracy.  Always.  The EU is a good thing.  It has helped staved off war and conflict (for the most part) in the EU since its formation.  Moreover the reduction of poverty and the introduction of social reforms across the EU has dramatically increased the standards of living across it.  That being said I do agree it needs to change and change quickly.  \textbf{Brexit} is a direct result of the EU complacency and is a terrible thing that will happen.  The format of this change I can't really tell at the moment.  Maybe increase the power of the EU parliament and reduce the powers of the executives.  Alternatively, there could be more directly elected representatives, as the parliament for each country is synced with another representative parliament in the EU.  An upper house if you will.  Maybe something along those lines.  In any event, while the EU is far from perfect, it is true to say that it has done a lot to curb the tribalism and jingoism of European countries.  It should also be remembered, but the alternative to the EU would be western and eastern European subjection to the Russian, American (and increasingly) Chinese interference and eventually domination.  Now, who would want to live in a world like that?\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Brexit, Nationalism & \cellcolor{green!5}Nationality - European or anti-Europeans, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}5/388 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.289 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Nationalism : Being proud of things you haven't done or achieved, presenting others as a constant threat to you and your people and hating people you never met or even talked to. THAT'S what \textbf{nationalism} is today and has been for quite some time. It brought us the genocide in Armenia, the genocide in Rwanda, two World Wars and the Yugoslavia wars. If you think this is a good thing, you might want to reconsider your values and where you stand in this world.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nationalism & \cellcolor{green!27}Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/84 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.381 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small What an absurdly reductive as well as flat wrong analysis. \textbf{Nationalism} is about far more than pride in another's accomplishments - which is a real and pervasive thing by the way, after all it would be a poor father that takes no joy in the achievements of his son - it's about the social contract between the dead, the living and the unborn. Tell me, if someone were to hand you a beautifully carved statue, would you immediately drop it to the floor and let it smash into a billion pieces simply because you didn't make it? As it is with the \textbf{nation}. We may not have created the world we see but we have a duty to preserve it. How you can lay tribal conflicts like the Rwandan genocide at the feet of \textbf{nationalism} is just inane stupidity and the words of a reactionary who has no clue of what he speaks.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nation, Nationalism & \cellcolor{green!5}Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/153 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.961 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Quintessence of Dust The Rwandan genocide wasn't just a tribal conflict, it was a direct result of colonialism and one tribal group using \textbf{nationalism} and inflammatory language to rile up fear and hatred against another notably with a strict control on media. The same thing was done in Yugoslavia after Tito's death, politicians in both cases created fear and division by pulling the oppression and victim card and in both cases it resulted in mass casualties and war crimes. Just on those two experiences alone, \textbf{nationalism} should be frowned upon and dealt with carefully, not celebrated as something admirable and desirable. By ignoring the mistakes of the past and refusing to learn from it, we are condemned to repeat them.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nationalism & \cellcolor{green!27}Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/120 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.667 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Tarik Pasic Hackneyed clichés aside, you yourself just admitted that these are not solely cases of \textbf{nationalism}. In the case of Yugoslavia there's a huge religious element which you seem to have completely ignored. The real problem is indeed tribalism, as a strong form of \textbf{nationalism} need not necessitate condemnation of the out-group. One can cherish what one has without the need to denigrate others. Tribal thinking, however, almost always leads to war and conflict. \textbf{Nationalism} does not, especially in the modern, nuclear era.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nationalism & \cellcolor{green!5}Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/84 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.571 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Quintessence of Dust Just because there are not solely cases of \textbf{nationalism} does not mean that \textbf{nationalism} should not be criticized and called out for creating mess. I will continue to call out this ideology regardless of what you think. Every single major conflict in the past century had a strong nationalist and even fascist element to it. The idea that you can only live among your own and that others are a threat to everything you hold dear was used to commit war crimes in recent history, you cannot deny that.  "One can cherish what one has without the need to denigrate others"You will be unable to give me a single tangible example in Europe where nationalist politicians and ordinary people that vote for them cherish what they have without denigrating others. Every single political platform coming from any of the major nationalist parties is based on denigrating others, insinuating things about them using guilt by association, presenting them as threats and in the more extreme forms calling for deportation and wishing for armed conflicts to take place to get rid of the perceived problem. Last time I checked, the white genocide and great remplacement theories weren't exactly promoted by leftist parties.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nationalism & \cellcolor{green!27}Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/204 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.98 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Tarik Pasic Your problem is that you're working from a spurious definition and then twisting everything else to make it fit.  You also seem to be ignorant of the fact that not all nationalisms are alike. German \textbf{nationalism} is very different from Scottish \textbf{nationalism}, for example. Your paper-thin understanding skews this so that everyone is Hitler. I can actually give you an example - me. I'm a proud nationalist but I live in a foreign country with neighbours from around the world. Even my partner is foreign. So by your bullshit definition I should actually hate all these things, whereas I love them. Seems like someone has some honest accounting to do.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nationalism & \cellcolor{green!5}Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/112 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.786 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Quintessence of Dust "Your paper-thin understanding skews this so that everyone is Hitler".That's where you're wrong, I'm simply looking at facts and facts show that nearly every major conflict, war or genocide in the past century had a deeply toxic nationalist (fascist) element to it. You are simply being dishonest about it because you like \textbf{nationalism} and probably agree with nationalist rhetoric which today almost exclusively aims to present others as a perpetual threat. The most hardcore nationalists see you as a threat, you just don't know it yet. The whole "I have a foreign partner and I'm foreign therefore how I can be a bad person" rhetoric needs to stop. It's the equivalent of saying you can't be \textbf{racism} because you have \textbf{black} friends, it's long worn out and \textbf{nobody} believes it anymore. If \textbf{nationalism} makes a comeback in Europe, I guarantee people like you will be the first to be either deported, imprisoned or have their basic rights taken from them. After all, nationalists throughout history have counted on useful idiots to help their twisted cause whether it be the harkis in Algeria or some of the native tribes in North America.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Nationalism, Nobody, Racism & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}5/195 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.564 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Tarik Pasic Point me to the sentence where I denied in any way the part toxic \textbf{nationalism} had to do with either world war. I'll bet you can't, because it doesn't exist. The more prescient point is that it was German \textbf{nationalism} that caused the Second World War, along with the poisonous \textbf{Nazi} doctrine. Not Irish \textbf{nationalism} or Scottish or Welsh or English or French or Dutch or Norwegian; just German. To use that as a barometer for all \textbf{nationalism} is just a flat piece of sophistry and you should be ashamed for doing it. And really, 'every major conflict'? Hyperbole much? What about the centuries of war caused by religion? Oh right, doesn't count because it wasn't 20th century, because that's our arbitrary starting point for some mysterious reason. Grow up.'You can't be racism'. No, I suppose I can't be an abstract concept. Again you're simply rejecting the argument without demonstrating why it's false. Perhaps it's because if your (hilariously child-like) view of \textbf{nationalism} is just 'you don't like them foreigns' then the fact that I live in a foreign state, have a foreign partner, have lived with and befriended people from across the planet is a point that seems to totally undo your malformed conception of what \textbf{nationalism} even is. You actually equated fascism with \textbf{nationalism} earlier, which just goes to show how painfully uninformed you are on the topic.As for the rest of your comment, do I detect a tone of threat? You do realize that we're not on the verge of nationalist gulags, yes? That a moderate increase in \textbf{nationalism} is in fact a welcome cure to decades of neo-liberal globalism? No? Or is it that everyone who disagrees with you is a bigot. How fucking convenient.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nationalism, Nazi & \cellcolor{green!5} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}9/293 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.072 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Quintessence of Dust You refered to my definition of \textbf{nationalism} (based on facts and recent events in history, by the way) as "absurdly reductive as well as flat wrong analysis" thus showing your bias and total unwillingness to understand my point of view right from the get-go. If you truly wanted to clearly condemn the toxicity of \textbf{nationalism} (not toxic \textbf{nationalism} because that's just made up, \textbf{nationalism} is \textbf{nationalism} and usually bears ressemblances regardless of the country or \textbf{ethnic} group, there is no such thing as "toxic \textbf{nationalism}") you would have already done so. We can talk about what happened before the 20th century, I fully acknowledge that religion has caused wars too but not in recent years which is the period closest to the one I currently live in.What you are is a patriot, not a nationalist. Patriotism and \textbf{nationalism} are two distinct concepts. One is a love for one's country, the other is an excessive love for one's country mixed in with a deep and often hypocritical hatred of others. Fascism was often made possible through \textbf{nationalism}, that's not my wishful thinking, there are multiple examples of that throughout history. When you go about trying to physically eliminate an entire \textbf{ethnic} group from a territory, that's a fascist idea at it's core mixed in with the nationalist concept that they somehow pose a threat.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnic, Nationalism & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}10/227 & \cellcolor{green!27}4.405 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Tarik Pasic This: 'Being proud of things you haven't done or achieved, presenting others as a constant threat to you and your people and hating people you never met or even talked to' was your definition and as well as being second hand phrasing, was insanely reductive and dismissive. You appear to be confusing the xenophobic, chest-thumping types of ethno-nationalist like Geert Wilders in the Netherlands and Marine Le Pen in France with ALL nationalists, which would include what I am - a civic nationalist. Please read into it and then you'll discover just how horribly misplaced your first definition is. I'll repeat: the problem in all of your arguments is that you use this nonsense definition and then everything else is extrapolated from it. As you should know, if you start with an incorrect premise then you'll end up with a incorrect result, which is exactly what you've done here and is obvious to anyone who has read through this. As for the 20th century, there's a huge hole in your history called 'communism'. Responsible for far greater dead bodies than \textbf{nationalism} (even in its ugliest form) and explicitly internationalist and expansionist. You can even make the argument that the Nazis were not 'truly' nationalist because they sought territory beyond their own borders and wished to incorporate different nationalities into their new empire. That tendency is not a nationalist one, it's an imperial one with Nordic supremacy and blood purity bullshit built in. Fascism, meanwhile, is unambiguously a perversion of \textbf{nationalism}, sure. But not all nationalist are totalitarians so to equate the two is just flat wrong. I really do wish that you'd take the time to correct your position on this because it's for your own betterment to understand these terms properly and not simply dismiss someone as a bigot or xenophobe or \textbf{racist} based upon an incomplete set of information.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nationalism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/313 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.958 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Quintessence of Dust You can claim incomplete set of information all you want, the reality on the field today is that most nationalists in Europe tend to align with the ideologies behind people like Wilders and Le Pen. There is no mainstream moderate \textbf{nationalism} movement to counterbalance that kind of fascism. To deny that is to be extremely dishonest and have a selective analysis of the situation. You may be a civic nationalist but you are an exception not the general rule.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nationalism & \cellcolor{green!27}Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/82 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.22 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Quintessence of Dust Conceed defeat to what? Are you seriously going to argue that Plaid Cymru, the SNP and The Republican Left of Catalonia are mainstream or that they have the public reach and popularity that fascists like Le Pen, Orban or Wilders do? That would be highly dishonest to even try to make that argument, you and I both know that those nationalist parties are marginal at best on a European scale and that they aren't really nationalistic to begin with except for UKIP which proves my point  (exception proves the rule). You can't name me a single actual form of \textbf{nationalism} (fascism) in recent history that has worked and didn't result in armed conflicts, war crimes or genocides, that's the sad reality. By denying the proven dangerosity of \textbf{nationalism} as illustrated by the examples I gave in my first comment, you are normalizing it, allowing it to spread unchallenged and you are being a useful idiot to the cause.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nationalism & \cellcolor{green!5}Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/161 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.242 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Tarik Pasic Yeah you smash that straw man. SNP and Plaid Cymru are pretty mainstream indeed, you're just unaware of them since they don't tend to grab the headlines very often. SNP is literally the majority party in Scotland, and they are indeed nationalistic, just not in the extremely narrow way that you seem totally unable to get away from. They, as with UKIP, are both examples of \textbf{nationalism} that haven't resulted in war or conflict so your challenge is basically nonsense. The fact that you're still using this: '\textbf{nationalism} (fascism)' shows me that you haven't bothered to read half of what I put here so I'm not sure why I should continue. You're clearly willfully ignorant of the topic and unable to understand shades of grey, nor do you seem to grasp that by labeling all nationalists as fascists you make your enemy seem far larger than they actually are, and push people that are civic nationalists like myself ever-further to the right, whilst simultaneously making yourself appear immune to reason. If there's any useful idiot here, perhaps you should look at yourself first.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nationalism & \cellcolor{green!27}Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/185 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.541 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Quintessence of Dust You seem to have trouble reading. I said they are not mainstream on a european scale in the sense that barely anyone outside their respective countries has heard about them and would vote for them to the extent that a lot of Europeans outside France would vote for Le Pen and support her ideas, same thing with Wilders. SNP and Plaid Cymru don't pose a potential threat to european democracy, Le Pen and especially Wilders on the other hand do."SNP is literally the majority party in Scotland, and they are indeed nationalistic, just not in the extremely narrow way that you seem totally unable to get away from."I'm not sure why you're blaming me. I don't dictate the current trend of \textbf{nationalism} (fascism) in Europe, politicians and their voters do so your accusations about me being unable to get away from a narrow way of looking at \textbf{nationalism} (a so-called "narrow way" that is based on facts and recent history) are completely baseless and frankly childish."They, as with UKIP, are both examples of \textbf{nationalism} that haven't resulted in war or conflict so your challenge is basically nonsense. "The Northern Irish conflict tells us that can happen at some point when nationalist parties start to gain too much influence, furthermore as I've stated before UKIP are the exception not the rule. Also, historically Scotland and England have been involved in wars before precisely through \textbf{nationalism}. The only reason they are no longer at war today is because european civilization has gotten civilized overtime and fighting for territories is no longer the historical and social mindset and trend nowadays.If my statements are the sole trigger and basis for pushing people like you further to the right that just means you were heavily on the right or on the far-right all along and simply didn't have the courage to admit it. That argument is about as stupid as those who claim that by labeling people \textbf{racist} they will actually start to become \textbf{racist}. Pathetic kindergarten logic that holds no water.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nationalism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}6/345 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.739 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Tarik Pasic You seem to have trouble understanding. By your own ridiculous logic, just because other people (that I also happen to disagree with) have a set of ideas that also falls under the rubric of '\textbf{nationalism}' that a defence of the broader concept (as well as my own civic \textbf{nationalism}) equals a defence of them. What sheer and utter nonsense. Your whole argument is basically like saying 'all Muslims are terrorists, and if you don't agree you're normalizing terrorism.' Well there are degrees here, subtleties and nuances. To essentialize based upon the worst example is a rather absurd thing to do when you think of Muslims, so why does that same openness to shades of grey not apply here? The answer is that it does, you just refuse to see it. The Northern Irish situation is somewhat separate, in that it again is tainted by religion. Had there not been a religious element, I'm of the belief that the conflict would have ended far sooner, but as I say that's a separate issue that one could spend months discussing so I won't bother here. The funny thing in all this is that if you had a modicum of sense, you'd want people like me as your ally. Ethno-nationalists aren't suddenly going to become social justice warriors just because you don't like them, but they might become civic nationalists if you attempt to reason with them. All you're doing is lumping together the ethno types with the civic types and calling it a day. How you apparently don't see that you're creating an enemy out of an ally there is beyond me, but since you also appear to have not learned a single thing in this entire discussion, it isn't surprising.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nationalism & \cellcolor{green!27}Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/291 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.344 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Quintessence of Dust I stand by what I wrote, your unwillingness to call out \textbf{nationalism} for what it mostly is and has been throughout history (that being fascism) ultimately leads to \textbf{nationalism} being given a free pass and being seen in the public as a legitimate political movement which it isn't. It's a movement that like communism has led to the deaths of millions of people throughout history as well as horrible unprecedented atrocities and war crimes, your unwillingness to acknowledge that by deflecting it to (civic??) \textbf{nationalism} is worrying to say the least. What you call civic \textbf{nationalism} doesn't properly exist in the political sphere anywhere, every single mainstream nationalist party in Europe ressembles the ACTUAL definition of \textbf{nationalism} I described earlier, to deny that is to lie about reality.With regards to Muslims, while you may have a moderate and sensible approach to that subject, I can assure you that most hardcore nationalists do not and that's part of the problem. Muslims have been targeted at large in recent past on european soil by nationalists (fascists), suffice to read up about what happened in Yugoslavia which was destroyed precisely by \textbf{nationalism}. My own family went through hell there because of nationalists.The Northern Irish conflict barely has anything to do with religion especially nowadays. Not every conflict involving two different religious groups is automatically a religious conflict, that's a mistake far too many people make.This goes back to my previous point, to say that you will somehow be pushed further to the right by people who despise \textbf{nationalism} and call it out for what is only proves that you are already far on the right right now. It's about as logical (or illogical in this case) as claiming you will actually end up becoming \textbf{racist} if someone calls you \textbf{racist} which is a ridiculous statement I've heard many times before. All it does is prove you were \textbf{racist} all along or in this case proves that you were nationalist all along and simply not honest about where you stand for whatever reason.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nationalism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}10/345 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.899 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Tarik Pasic I will and do call out ethno-nationalism for what it is. It helps if you understand the terms, you see. Similarly, if you're dealing with socialists, it's helpful to know your democratic socialist from your Stalinist. A similar distinction you seem pathologically unable to make. Which is a shame, because if you did you'd realize that most parties across Europe are a form of civic nationalist, in fact I'd argue it's so mainstream that most parties don't even bother to acknowledge it. Muslim point is irrelevant, you didn't understand what I said. As someone that has lived with Northern Irish people, I beg to differ. As to your latter point, it's not that you magically become a \textbf{racist} if called it enough times, it's that your voice is dismissed with the other racists as if you were the same, which in turn leads to widespread disengagement. It's not transforming a non-\textbf{racist} to a \textbf{racist}, it's alienating your allies for no real reason.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Quintessence of Dust You have failed to show how ethno-\textbf{nationalism} and \textbf{nationalism} are not the same thing and what differentiates them so much. And if you want to argue that present day mainstream nationalist european parties are not ethno-nationalist then you are being dishonest once again or are completely ignorant of what those parties propose and aim to achieve. Even the so-called moderate (often times nowhere near moderate) nationalist parties have strong elements of \textbf{ethnicity} in their political agenda that they either fully acknowledge, embrace and put forward or that they hide behind like hypocrites to present a more acceptable but deceitful image of themselves in order to trick unsuspected potential voters.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small A German who feels like a European first = a German imposing an identity on to the rest of us to assuage her her own guilt complex. Like her children, I am also the product of two people from two different European countries. I do not feel like a 'European' because that means \textbf{nothing} to me. Its like saying, I am a 'human being'. It goes without saying. I am a Dane. I was born in Denmark and I live in Denmark. You cannot impose an identity onto people, especially not for the selfish reasons this German \textbf{woman} subscribes to. Germany must deal with its past by itself and not impose it onto the rest of us. Her daughter's innocent ignorance is not a moral lesson to be taught as some kind of wisdom. To pretend otherwise is a form of self-deception. The UK leaving the EU is an act of national self-determination and has \textbf{nothing} to do with the self-perception of individuals. Like her daughter, I also grew up in the UK, and I spent my entire childhood there. This did not give me any right to lecture British people on their identity of their desire for self-determination. In many ways I am a person of two cultures and two nations (just like so many others on this planet) and I know from long experience that this can lead to contradictions and conflicts in one's own identity. These can be many and varied and can lead to intense confusion. At the same time however, being of two different cultures can also give a richer understanding of how nations and cultures work and how nations and peoples can not simply be forced together to form a compatable union. True harmony has to be homogenous and equally beneficial to both parties. The EU is neither. On the contrary, the EU is a top-down, political imposition that takes no account of cultural differences and seeks to impose undemocratic and unacountable socio-economic policies as the basis for union. I share no cultural identity with Germans and I find this claim to a 'European identity' to be both an abanondment of Germany's cultural responsibilities and an unwanted invasion on my own national cultural identity. Germany and the German people own their past. They cannot run away from who they were, because who they were is still who they are. Individual Germans may seek refuge outside of their shameful past, but they cannot escape the fact that they are the product of German culture and they must not impose their desired identity onto the rest of us and expect us to carry their burden of shame. I will not identity as a European just so you can feel better about yourself and you do not get to run away from who are by pretending tha we are one and the same!

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Aquila Tempestate Modern \textbf{nation} states are the product of massive social engineering. E.g. most French didn't speak French when the modern French state was constituted, it was a hodgepodge of various often disparate regional cultures that didn't particularly care for one another or see each other in \textbf{common}, ditto for most of Western Europe.Much like how Colonial powers divided up Africa (as an example) without much concern for the tribal and cultural boundaries relevant to the indigenous populations, so to the ruling houses in Europe divided Europe, i.e. kingdoms weren't rationally organized along cultural boundaries. The problem arose when monarchies were transitioned into modern \textbf{nation} states, no one wanted to give up land, so national identities had to be (largely) invented whole-cloth  to justify existing irrational boundaries. The romanticism of the Romantic era was largely about the artificial construction of new racial origin myths and concepts of racial/cultural identity which were previously not organic to the fragmented populations concerned (abetted by \textbf{transition} away from rural agricultural based societies into urban and industrial ones) ...as a justification for nations organized along supposed racial/cultural boundaries rather than arbitrarily based on some land a king conquered once. This is why one of the first efforts within these new nations was often a national education curriculum which would inculcate this new national identity along the lines of a shared \textbf{common} language and a shared national founding myth ...modern nationalist identity had to be invented post facto often at the expense of severe suppression of the strong regionalism/multiculturalism which had preceded it. Kings rarely cared about any of this, it was accepted that kings were often not of the same stock as those they ruled, their justification was simple enough: god and military might. This, of course, would not fly in the context of the secular liberalism which accompanied much of the new nationalist era.So yeah, while that all is a bit simplified (it being Youtube) it is worth considering the historical context of these identities to which you may cling so tightly.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Common, Nation, Transition & \cellcolor{green!5}Nationality - General, Sexual Identity - Transexuality, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}5/340 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.471 \\  \hline
