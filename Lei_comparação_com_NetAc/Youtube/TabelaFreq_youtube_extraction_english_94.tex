\hline\cellcolor{green!27}\small I support women's rights but I don't support the third feminist wave it seems to me to be just \textbf{misandry}. Just as an example look at Michele Causse she literally despised men she said that women should not need or want men at all. She supported euthanasia and committed physician-assisted suicide on YouTube even though she had no terminal illness at all. There is one thing she did say that I agree with and that was that the radical feminist movement is a \textbf{lesbian} movement,she was obviously very proud of that fact.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Lesbian, Misandry & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General, Sexual Identity - Female homosexuality & \cellcolor{green!27}2/92 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.174 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I believe feminists have destroyed the traditional role men play. Men are leaders and we as women are here to help man. We were made  from man and for man. The Bible and the Torah tells us what a honorable godly \textbf{woman} is and how to act and how to be with a man and what is appropriate and whats not appropriate. The Bible gave us our morals amd values. The stripping of the Bibles teachings have degraded us as a people and as a country. Thats why we see the confusion of the  lgbtqaijbdldosbdbxjckcnvkksjs community!!!!! The lack of appropriate morals and values have turned this country into a pig pin of immoral sinners. And the Bible tells us clearly what to do with these immoral sinners! Get rid of them permanently if they dont repent of their nasty immoral ways.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/141 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.709 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small If you are a \textbf{woman}, and not a "feminist", you are labelled as anti-feminist....lol. I thought being a feminist was about empowering women, NOT labelling them as an enemy if they don't share the same views, as someone who thinks they represent what a feminist is.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Who would have thought that her criticism of Modern Day Feminism or Third Wave Feminism would be more relevant today than ever since when she first she called its lunacy?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The interviewer is confused. Camille is saying Ladies you need to \textbf{Woman} Up, Use your Lady-B's and that means Do it Your Damn Self and like men, if you don't provide then your family suffers so you should reject the Welfare state and feel it is an assault on your own womanhood.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small This interviewer's tiny \textbf{feminazi} brain is screaming, 'does not compute!' Listen to the tone and leading nature, in some cases quite provocative, of her questions!

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small "She's as \textbf{misogynist} like every average man is."Someone is fluent in feminist shaming language. Response to your misandristic comment/charge of misogyny:One may ask the accuser how does a pro-male agenda become inherently anti-female (especially since feminists often claim that gains for men and women are 'not a zero-sum game').  One may also ask the accuser how do they account for women who agree with the target's viewpoints. The Code \textbf{Black} shaming tactic often integrates the logical fallacies of 'argumentum ad misericordiam' (viz., argumentation based on pity for women) and/or 'argumentum in terrorem'.Are you awere of the uglyfying effect of feminism on \textbf{woman}?

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Camille: Women should take more responsibility for their actions/behavior, stand up for themselves and not rely on mommy and daddy figures within the government to take care of their mistakes! Immediate follow up statement from interviewer 'So you don't think there's a problem with \textbf{sexual} assault?' 🙄🤦🏼‍♂️This wasn't an honest interview, it was a hit job to try and pin Camille into a corner and make her look bad and not be taken seriously...\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Sexual & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/75 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.333 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small What Paglia fails to realize is the inherent cognitive dissonance between living life as a \textbf{woman} and being able to live freely. It is unfair to blame \textbf{woman} for wanting to live freely rather than blame (the overwhelmingly male) perpetrators for hindering this. She claims women need to take responsibility and yet does not seem to recognize that it is the men who are ultimately responsible for their actions. As much as the right can't stomach it, the 1 in 5 statistic remains. Women have a right to be fearful and a right to ask for protection, damn anyone who calls women weak for asking not to be assaulted for living "freely". \textbf{Woman} should be afforded the same life experience as men yet the female experience limits women in their freedoms; so it's impossible to live freely as a \textbf{woman}.In the words of Sylvia Plath  'Yes, my consuming desire is to mingle with road crews, sailors and soldiers, barroom regulars—to be a part of a scene, anonymous, listening, recording—all this is spoiled by the fact that I am a girl, a female always supposedly in danger of assault and battery. My consuming interest in men and their lives is often misconstrued as a desire to seduce them, or as an invitation to intimacy. Yes, God, I want to talk to everybody as deeply as I can. I want to be able to sleep in an open field, to travel west, to walk freely at night...' Ironically the dismantling of \textbf{gender} is required in order to truly "free women"\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}5/259 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.931 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Men aren't guaranteed EITHER they've just been taught since they were young that it's baked into the cake and know no one is gonna protect them and thus at least SOMEWHAT mentally prepare for it. When I walked home from bars when I used to drink I knew what streets to not be on, stayed under street lights as much as possible so I could watch shadows coming from behind me and wear obvious headphones with no music so someone would think I couldn't hear them to bait carelessness on the potential mugger's part. I've even wrapped my \textbf{zip} up jacket around my waist to hide my wallet in my back pocket whilst shirtless in the winter to look NOT WORTH MUGGING on a long walk home one night.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The interviewer makes a stunning statement which presumes that conservative speakers who are banned from college campuses preach "hate".

LOL the interviewer does not obviously know that it's \textbf{common} sense today that every INDIVIDUAL-MEN AND \textbf{WOMAN} are responsible for their own life and happiness- So are you saying that men ARE responsible for \textbf{woman}'s happiness?????

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small So what the interviewer is saying is that women are weak fragile things that need to be protected and taken care of by men. And that they can't be held responsible for their own actions that men must be responsible for not only their own actions but the actions of women. How very patriarcal of her. These are the same additives and belies that 60's feminism fought against it is also the the reasons women were not allowed to make contracts in the past ( women were not held legally responsible for their mistakes or actions so if they made a deal and then broke it the person they made a deal with had not way of enforcing the deal. at least not with the women so they would take a male relative to court over it. And because of this after a while people stopped making deals with women and only made them with their male relatives).Modern feminism is regressive. Just like modern social justice.

She is also correct that young women need to be responsible for the situations they put themselves in and for their own actions that may have negative consequences.  Third wave feminism is full of contradictions-women are smart and strong, but they can't get into certain jobs or programs without affirmative action programs.  Women don't need men, except of course to do all the dangerous and dirty jobs.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small This is a waste of time except how adept and brilliant Camille is at countering these attacks on her position by a clueless feminist journalist. The conversation between Jordan Peterson and Camille Paglia is far more fascinating. They discuss the history of how all of this idiocy going on today started. I am not familiar with exactly what Postmodernism is. However, I think I recognize to whom they are referring when they use the term, Neo-Marxist. I believe these are the same individuals whom I refer to as pseudo-Marxist. Jordan and Camille both discussed how much the Neo-Marxists despise the working class. This exactly coincides with the deliberate attack on working class men (the true Proletariat) by the feminists (the true Bourgeoisie). This is why I call them pseudo-Marxists. In the past most Marxists were at least perceptive enough to realize how necessary it was to enlist the aid of the Proletariat (especially working class men) to be successful in replacing the status quo. After the success of the revolution, then later on they would prosecute the Proletariat. But, the modern pseudo-Marxists aren't even intelligent enough to realize how foolish it is to deliberately alienate the true Proletariat especially when you are so obviously Bourgeoisie (professional women, making mega bucks, dressed to the nines, glittering in jewels, living in showroom houses with designer furniture). I would also call these people pseudo-Anarchists. They also consistently wrongly refer to themselves as Anarchists and yet they are constantly lobbying for MORE laws, MORE restrictions on basic civil liberties. It is obvious to me that they have no clue what being an anarchist truly means. If you look at many of us who now call ourselves MGTOW and see some of the statements being made I think you would agree that many of us are true anarchists, philosophically but not necessarily politically. These people (especially the women) are really sad, pathetic poseurs. They may talk the talk but they definitely do not walk the walk. One of the many examples of this contradiction would be a feminist who blames everything on the "\textbf{Patriarchy}" and demands that system be destroyed. But then less than fifteen minutes later she is actually DEFENDING the existence of the \textbf{Patriarchy} when she makes the demand that "all men should have the responsibility of protecting all women!" She is apparently not aware that the system for which she wants complete destruction already supported her second idea. But, she is also not intelligent enough to keep her big mouth shut because some MGTOWs liked her first idea and despise her second one anyway for the very reason that her first idea would deliberately eliminate the idea that men have ANY responsibility to women at all including being required to protect all of them. What is Toxic Masculinity? Any idea or process or action embraced by any man which could conceivably result in a situation where it might be personally toxic to him, in other words detrimental in some way to his personal well being. For example the idea of believing that men should pay for women's dinners on a date is potentially toxic because it may threaten his financial stability.  Getting married is toxic because the marriage has a high probability of ending in divorce which could expose him to a very toxic environment dealing with cops and courts and government bureaucrats especially those who are feminists and have historically proven they are misandrist. \textbf{Misandry} is EXTREMELY toxic to men and should be avoided at all costs.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Misandry, Patriarchy & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/586 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.512 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I think the real problem is that women have moved ahead very quickly with the establishment of their own \textbf{sexual} identity and equanimity of standing in \textbf{sexual} relationships but have failed to simultaneously develop their ability/willingness to take responsibility for their own actions in that regard.  Not to sound like a comic book here but - With great power comes great responsibility!  Women have eagerly taken up all the the reins of power but they continue to fail to act responsibly in the exercise of that power.  When push comes to shove, many women will continue to fall back on finger pointing to escape having to take responsibility for their actions when those actions lead to undesirable outcomes.  They know full well that when they point the finger at a man, society will rush in to destroy that man on their behalf.  This is because society continues to considers women to be "powerless" (even though they are not) and affords them a protected status in that regard.  As long a society continues to ignore the role of women in bringing about an undesirable outcome, we will have turmoil between the sexes.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Sexual & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/191 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.047 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Paul Scott 'so you're saying....' is the main tactic the interviewer used throughout this interview. By the logic you present, the Jordan Peterson interview with Kathy Neuman was also in good faith (which i hope we can both agree, was not). These types of interviews are quite \textbf{common} and are used to quote activists out of context to discredit them (both left and right). Furthermore, characterizing the left in such a manner of 'always going for the throat' is simply a falsehood because many members operate behind closed doors and would do anything but make themselves vulnerable.

Well if that is so, you are just proving my point. Women get ahead mainly because of their \textbf{sexual} power over men like you...who end up friend zoned :) Being a man does not mean you have to give to women what they want :) Actually many women admit they want a man capable of saying No to them.And yes, I do care about long lasting relationships, because \textbf{promiscuous} way of living serves only young people and hurts children. And I wrote also that \textbf{promiscuous} men are irresponsible as well. See, that is what I would like to come back - responsibility. Which is tough sale I know. Responsibility feels unpleasant, binding where freedom feels so nice and unbinding...I am not sure if women proved that they are capable that much. If companies forbid men being aggressive toward women (because she feels hurt) or fire people advocating for the case of men (James Damore or CERN scientist whose name I do not remember now, that wrote and supported by facts that women are not good in physics for example) convinces me that there is a double standard for men and women. Or what about the case that happened in Canada. Women became ministers just because they were women, not because they were the most capable.People have been given freedom of choice and look at the world now....pure chaos. We need to start asking difficult questions like how much freedom is too much of freedom or how much empathy is too much of empathy. Again - it is a hard sell to liberals like you, but too much of freedom and no responsibility leads to chaos with no rules Too much of responsibility and no freedom leads to pure order with no freedom. Freedom where we can prosper lies in between - chaos of nature and natural order, which one is.I am glad conservatives have started speaking up. It is quite interesting to see what liberals keep saying and what conservatives have started saying. It is my belief that the Truth can be revealed only if we look at it from at least two different perspectives. I hope Trump will be re-elected. I hope more conservative political leaders will be re-elected. I hope there will be new Sillicon Valley made by conservatively thinking people. If feminism has been a social project lasting over 100 years it is perfectly understandable to look at the results of this project. Only a mad man keeps running a project that causes more harm than good. And if it has been advocacy for women's rights till now, the time has come to start standing up for men. If we wish to survive.

If you are a \textbf{woman} with respect and confidence in yourself and careful about what situations you put yourself in, you can avoid a lot of problems.  As a man I do the same kind of thing when I go somewhere,  I judge the situation and if I find it to be unsafe for myself or others with me I leave and take responsibility for myself.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The women has a PhD in \textbf{gender} studies, if she says she's \textbf{transgender}, she should know what she's talking about. Also, on the \textbf{gender} issue, just because she doesn't want a penis, that doesn't mean she's not \textbf{transgender}, which is also one of many reasons I love her. She can enjoy her fluidity without insisting on having permenant body changes so she's clearly not at any of the far ends of the spectrum. Her saying "I'm \textbf{lesbian}" is only meant to let people know that her \textbf{sexual} preference is women quickly, rather than spend hours on explaining \textbf{gender} fluidity, which she does brilliantly in other talks. Her being biologically a women and into women translates into "\textbf{lesbian}" so I think it is very smart not to overcomplicate things, when it is unnecessary like most democrats these days, and thus get lost in the details.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender, Lesbian, Sexual, Transgender & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General, Sexual Identity - Female homosexuality, Sexual Identity - Transexuality & \cellcolor{green!5}8/144 & \cellcolor{green!5}5.556 \\  \hline

But, \textbf{nobody} is obliged to agree with you or respect you, and same applies to me.
