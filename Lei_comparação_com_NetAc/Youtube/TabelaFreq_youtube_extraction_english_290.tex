But, today 100 million mixed blood NATIVE AMERICANS are mostly white Christians conservative and blacks. Learn and search, SPANISH AND MEXICAN \textbf{INDIAN} POLICIES and learn that Spanish and Mexicans were invaders upon Native American lands and Mexicans and Hispanics say they are going to kill the white people and \textbf{black} people. Muslims refugees say they are going to take over this country and Islam teaches to kill Jews and Christians. We who are mixed blood NATIVE AMERICAN, why should we care about those who turned their backs on us. In a few generations the majority of our population will be mixed blood NATIVE AMERICAN. You the government and tribes have stabbed us in the back. You are responsible for the genocidal act of 1985. You bite the hand that today would feed you and protect you from the genocidal politicians, Latinos and Muslims. The are out to continue genocide upon us. MANAA or MAKE AMERICA NATIVE AMERICAN AGAIN is our only option. Close the border. Send illegal invaders and their children back to where they came from.

However like many I did 23\&Me and was able to get in contact with half siblings who have answers. To be told it still doesn't matter, your 16.4 quantum is not enough to be recognized as a part of something bigger a part of recognition to your heritage destroys someone who is desperate to cling onto some fourm of culture identity. Then to be unacknowledged by those who view you less than them at a Powwow deters us minority with a lower percentage from wanting to learn further, from wanting to attend powwows and from trying to meet those with same heritage to understand their roots. Tell me how does a casted aside child now an adult who finds they have 16 + quantum but below required to be acknowledged they should feel, they were never accept by the white mans culture of the adopted family. What place is there on this earth, what cultural identity through a people that their great grandparents who refuse to accept or acknowledge them for the small 16.4. They loose out on a chance to learn and help make a difference in their Tribal contributions because of quantum bias that is a fourm of \textbf{ethnic} discrimination of your own people who are the future but aren't good enough in the tribes eyes and that is how we loose to the white man with every discrimination rejection and refuse to accept those who are half breed as you call those lesser or hybrid with even less quantum it breaks my heart.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small "Unless Native American, you came from somewhere else" (Barrack Obama).The truth of the matter is that indigenous Native People would forever be the subject of scapegoat, and victimized by the Colonizers of their lands, as long as they occupy those rich bountiful lands in order to justify their occupation. In other word, the Colonizers, are 'Living in Denial'. That is what is all about, and the rest is the history. Besides, indigenous Native people in Colonized lands of Anglo British and Spaniard are more of the same. Kill the indigenous natives and whoever is left, marginalize them and create artificial poverty, once that poverty becomes crime and drinking, the media points to the poor and blames them to continue to stigmatize the 'other' community, scumbags, etc. Do you know the fact that Indigenous Native people had built such great civilizations as Mayan, Inca and Aztec without outside help, and all from the scratch, and all on their own, since they had been cut off from the rest of the world for ten of thousand of years. In other words, they actually are great and proud people. All they need is their beloved fatherlands back, the lands that their ancestors forebearers had lived through thick and \textbf{thin}, endured through hardships of all sorts. Moreover, the hidden mega genocide of indigenous Native American population in continents of America 500 yrs ago was around 15 millions, while European population in Europe was around 20 millions. Today, Native population at 15 million, while European population , in continents of America + Europe, at a staggering 'ONE BILLION'! For instance, 200 years ago in U.S.A, around 3 million Germans came, and now there are 65 millions German-Americans; while 150 years ago, around 2 millions Irish came, and now there are 45 million Irish-Americans. While 500 years ago there were estimated 5 to 6 millions indigenous Native Americans in U.S.A, before Christopher Columbus arrived, today there are only around 2 million indigenous Native Americans survived. Imagine what would it be like today if Native American people had possessed some sort of nuclear weapons to defend themselves? The answer is they would still have their own beloved fatherlands, plus their population comparable to that of European population. I've no doubt about that. In my humble opinion, it's about time to decolonize the Colonized lands, and return it to rightful owners Native American people. Remember, notorious global cardinal crimes such as Slavery and Colonialism had long been over, why on earth is this another notorious Colonization still lingering on?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Here's new information.  Good news for you.  From Wikipedia.  The first peoples to inhabit The United States of America - the Clovis Culture -- 14,000 years ago.  Available genetic data show that the Clovis people are the direct ancestors of roughly 80 of all living Native American populations in North and South America, with the remainder descended from ancestors who entered in later waves of migration.  As reported in February 2014, DNA from the 12,600-year-old remains of Anzick boy, found in Montana, has affirmed this connection to the peoples of the Americas. In addition, this DNA analysis affirmed genetic connections back to ancestral peoples of northeast Asia. This adds weight to the theory that peoples migrated across a land bridge from Siberia to North America.  Known as "Clovis First", the predominant hypothesis among archaeologists in the latter half of the 20th century had been that the people associated with the Clovis culture were the first inhabitants of the Americas. The primary support for this was that no solid evidence of pre-Clovis human habitation had been found. According to the standard accepted theory, the Clovis people crossed the Beringia land bridge over the Bering Strait from Siberia to Alaska during the period of lowered sea levels during the ice \textbf{age}, then made their way southward through an ice-free corridor east of the Rocky Mountains in present-day Western Canada as the glaciers retreated.  I like the Oshara Tribe, though, but that was a couple after Clovis.   Siberia would be just west of the middle of Russia.

I meant to say that the tree does not die when the \textbf{fruit} is harvested, because it's not a consequence of harvesting \textbf{fruit} from a tree."All plants actually can feel pain." That is not true. Plants cannot feel pain because they cannot have subjective experience. They can still react to stimuli. But that does not mean they can feel pain."They have that sense you might've heard of, touch." Plants cannot sense, because they do not have a nervous system nor a brain. They can only react. An analogy: A calculator reacts to me pressing it's buttons, but the calculator does not sense. Only a reaction."I'm so shocked you think fruits and vegetables are the same as trees." I never said that. Ever."Have you never heard of the experiment where you let a plant listen to different music? The environment they're in determines how long they live." That does not prove that they feel pain, nor that they can "hear", nor that they can have subjective experiences. It only proves that they react to their environment."at least I wish the best for the meat" Don't you mean you wish the best for the animal? The meat is only matter that was part of the animal."Everything has a life" Incorrect. Dirt does not have a live, Mountains do not have a life, My smarthphone does not have a life.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small genesis bustamante 'Fruits are just part of the tree' I think ya did. And LOL, so, when you eat something like an orange and you smell that 'fresh fruit' smell, you realize that's a defense mechanism that a lot of fruits have to poison something? LOL, have you ever had a plant growing up? Most likely not because then you would know that reacting to the environment you're in, is a defense mechanism or an adaptation. Just because a plant can regenerate its limbs means you can kill it? LOL, so why is killing a snake bad? Plants can sense touch because most plants react specifically to touch. A calculator actually can have a touch sense because it senses the keys you're hitting and then reacting to it. And LOL, I meant that stuff like plants, animals, and humans have a life cycle, but ironically the things you listed Do have a life cycle as well. It's just not the same as everything else. Phones/Electronics have a life cycle because you can't use it without having to charge it at some point, can you? Once it 'dies,' can you continue using it? No. Not without charging it again. And dirt, seriously? You don't know anything, do you? Dirt actually comes from dead skill cells, dust, and sometimes secretions. It has a different life cycle just like phones. Dirt is actually the life source of some plants. How do you think dirt is formed? Magic? Dirt comes from basically dead things, but it actually can live. Soil, for example is full of life. Ever heard of microorganisms?? Water bottles actually do have a life cycle. It's called when it expires because all water actually can expire. Also, I'm not sure if mountains can die, but they do live. There's sometimes stripes of white or \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} on a rock and depending on how many stripes it has, it can live for billions of years.Jeez, did you learn \textbf{nothing} from school? And bananas are better than eating a chicken? LOL, you know that all fruits and vegetables are filled with GMO's, right? Wild bananas are actually poisonous. All fruits and vegetables are. Farmers genetically modified fruits and vegetables to make them edible. Not to mention the pesticides in them. So, remind me, if you raised a chicken yourself and killed it, How is that worse than eating genetically modified foods that will wind up killing you as well?I want to end processed factories for good and hunt the animals myself. Haha funny how the only edible wild fruits or vegetables you would have are small potatoes and a drop of corn.Vegans and vegetarians are the worst. They claim their diet is good for you and don't know the first thing about what They eat.A living organism that shows no signs of 'life,' pain, or feeling, then why don't we eat humans like that, huh? Oh right! Cuz you're also a hypocrite. If you wanna say, 'Well, it basically doesn't have a life, let's eat it!' Then why not eat corpses, dirt, blood, brains, or anything like that? Cuz most things have lives. You just wanna kill anything that didn't have a face.Jeez, I learned all this in middle school. How \textbf{old} are you that you have no clue that soil actually does live?? And most importantly, how plants can actually have kids. Not sure about vegetables, but fruits definitely have kids. LOL, wow, you don't know anything about plants. I'm a carnivore and I know more about what you eat than you do. I also know that all food is bad for you and it's because of these stupid factories. We're actually not supposed to eat that much, and drink only when we're thirsty. And so ironically, we're not able to digest corn, so there goes surviving on corn.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Native Atheist You are also trying to drive the notion of the good savage. Your ancestors were savages. Some scientists believe North America was more violent than the European civilization that replaced it. War and violence was a global affair. The world was not at peace anywhere, that includes the North American Indians.Native Americans definitely waged war long before Europeans showed up. The evidence is especially strong in the American Southwest, where archaeologists have found numerous skeletons with projectile points embedded in them and other marks of violence; war seems to have surged during periods of drought. But scientists such as Pinker, Keeley and LeBlanc have replaced the myth of the noble savage with the myth of the savage savage...."quantitative body counts—such as the proportion of prehistoric skeletons with ax marks and embedded arrowheads or the proportion of men in a contemporary foraging tribe who die at the hands of other men—suggest that pre-state societies were far more violent than our own." According to Pinker, the 17th-century philosopher Thomas Hobbes "got it right" when he called pre-state life a "war of all against all." Thanksgiving guilt trip: How warlike were Native Americans before Europeans showed up?Human skeletons from as early as the Woodland Period (250 B.C. to A.D. 900) show occasional marks of violence, but conflict intensified during and after the thirteenth century, by which time farmers were well established in the Plains. After 1250, villages were often destroyed by fire, and human skeletons regularly show marks of violence, scalping, and other mutilations. Warfare was most intense along the Missouri River in the present-day Dakotas, where ancestors of the Mandans, Hidatsas, and Arikaras were at war with each other, and towns inhabited by as many as 1,000 people were often fortified with ditch and palisade defenses. Excavations at the \textbf{Crow} Creek site, an ancestral Arikara town dated to 1325, revealed the bodies of 486 people–men, women, and children, essentially the town's entire population–in a mass grave. These individuals had been scalped and dismembered, and their bones showed clear evidence of severe malnutrition, suggesting that violence resulted from competition for food, probably due to local overpopulation and climatic deterioration. Violence among farmers continued from the 1500s through the late 1800s.

As a naturopathic practitioner, hygienic nutritional consultant, Iridologist wholistic health educator, with 49 years of practice, I have been a vegetarian for 49 yrs.,  a vegan for 48 yrs., , a raw vegan for 16 yrs.; and my children and grandchildren have been vegans all their lives (5 yrs. through 41 yrs.). They do not become ill in any way and never have. Because of the cultural and traditional diet I was born into I was as ill as the native Americans until I learned to eat appropriately at 21 years \textbf{old} on my death bed. I eat no corpses or exploitive products from animals. It is absolutely unnecessary and is linked to diabetes, cardiovascular disease, respiratory congestion, cancer and degenerative aging of all cells. There is no fiber, no enzymes but plenty of waste in the form of casein, ammonia, xanthine oxidase, uric acid, pus and so on.

TWO things: There is predation in nature.  If a person believes that we're all animals, and it's okay for lions to hunt, then it shouldn't bother that person when we eat meat.  Secondly - It's actually cruel to let herds breed uncontrollably.  They will eventually use up their resources and some will end up dying slow deaths due to starvation.  They also will end up eating crops that are meant for humans if left unchecked (deer).  What we all should be fighting for is proper treatment and responsible management of animals.  Bonus - plants experience pain as well.  Many species send chemicals and have other defense mechanisms to avoid being eaten.  Fruits are made to be eaten (seed dispersal strategy), that's true, but not all plants or parts of plants are,.. and yet we do consume them.
