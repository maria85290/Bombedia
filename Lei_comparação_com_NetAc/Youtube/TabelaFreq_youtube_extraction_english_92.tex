I don't wish anything evil for her or I don't even hate her. I just don't respect her. May she do all the good what she can with her life. My point is that she's \textbf{dumb} and ignorant.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small GTA guides for gamers Researchers at Ohio State University examined 10,878 men and women to determine if hair color had anything to do with intelligence. Participants in the study were given the Armed Forces Qualification Test, an exam used by the Pentagon to determine intelligence of all recruits.The study showed blonde haired women have a higher mean IQ (103.2 points) than women with brown (102.7), \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} (101.2) or \textbf{black} hair (100.5). Blondes were also more likely to be classified as geniuses and less likely to have an extremely low IQ than women with other hair colors, the researchers found."This study provides compelling evidence that there shouldn't be any discrimination against blondes based on their intelligence," said author Jay Zagorsky, a scientist at Ohio State University.Among blonde haired men, the average mean IQ was 103.9, a fraction lower than the average of brown haired men (104.4) but above those with \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} locks (100.5) or \textbf{black} hair (100.1)\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Red & \cellcolor{green!27} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - Native-American & \cellcolor{green!27}6/159 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.774 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small There's no need to be sexist or \textbf{racist}. Let me just get this straight. The man in the vid said 'that's called being a woman'. It's plain stupid to assume all women think like that, since, like men, they're all different individuals with different minds and that's a fact. So obviously, because of that, it's also extremely rude to say such a thing since (by the man's logic) he assumes all women think alike. He probably wouldn't say this about men (I'm pretty damn sure about this).

Basic questions that all Americans learn in school yet when I quizzed my coworkers (all who have bachelor and/or masters degrees and were 100 born and raised in the US) on the basic history questions they got maybe 4 out of the 100 correct.  Why is that?  Is it bc they don't retain information or bc they chose to exclude irrelevant information that doesn't pertain to them directly.  I mean, you can always research that info so why fill your brain up with it?  Funny thing is I quizzed some of their younger kids with the same test and the young kids got all 100 questions correct.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Omar De la Fuente - The reason people in California are smart has little to do with immigrants. It's because liberal blue states which are mainly up north and on the coasts have historically put an emphasis on reading and literacy. Liberals spend shit loads on education while education funding is always the first thing on the budget chopping block in conservative \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} states i.e. the entire South. Look at what's happening right now in W.Virginia with the entire state's teachers going on strike because many work two jobs and are still on public assistance.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Although I'm certain to be met with your stereotypical and false Liberal rhetoric...I'll answer that: I AM a Trump supporter.  I am a white male who KNOWS I'm a white male...and neither apologizes or hides the fact.  I take pride in being a white male, and neither apologize for it nor feel I have anything to apologize for.  I take pride in my \textbf{sex}, my \textbf{race}, my \textbf{nation}, and my family and for that I owe no one an explanation or an apology.  I'm heterosexual, educated, and like women and enjoy their company.  I believe in Honor and maintaining it as a Man; Women are the Heart of Honor.  I'm traditional in upbringing and with my value system, and hold strong beliefs in a nuclear family where one parent remains at home to raise children who believe in hard work, responsibility, and duty to family; children should NOT be left in daycare, with strangers, or raised outside of the familial unit that conceived and bore them.  I don't mince words with Fools nor do I entertain their delusions of grandeur or self-entitlement.  I believe there are TWO genders, and that people are born one of them and can't arbitrarily decide on a daily basis what they are going to "present" as that particular day.  I further believe that men should open doors, pull out chairs, and rise when a lady either enters or leaves the room.  I don't think women can necessarily do everything as well as men but I don't think that makes them inferior...it just makes them women.  I also don't mind being labeled \textbf{racist}, homophobe, misogynistic, ignorant, or any other "ist" or "phobe" word by Liberals or like minded people who are so close minded with their ways of thinking that they make complete hypocrites of themselves; hypocritical by screeching that everyone's life, choices, and decisions matter SO LONG as they coincide with the "La-La-Land" philosophy that they themselves entertain.  I believe that "Justice" is not often synonymous with "Legal" or "The Law," and sometimes one has to seek Justice for oneself and one's loved ones when the Rule of Law or the dismissive ideology of "Civilization" get in the way of what is TRULY Just.  Lastly, while I don't necessarily believe in god or gods, I do believe that there is a Higher Purpose that each of us is born to, and part of the journey of Life is to discover what that purpose is and to further make the decision to either strive for it...or not.  That is who I am and what I believe.  Likely, you'll respond with a snarky comment on my political beliefs, attempt to besmirch either my beliefs or your perception of my intellect or education, and lastly lambast me with a soap-box stance of your own beliefs juxtaposed with ideologies you either don't comprehend correctly or misconstrue the true meaning of.

Though they can't be offendED, since a joke isn't a sentient being that cares about its feelings. Check what you wrote. Christ, it's painful addressing your retarded assumptions.The interpretation of a joke is your own fucking business, what's NOT open to interpretation is the FACT he was FUCKING JOKING!!

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small obviously that first sentence was a mistake on my part.  no one would write that and mean to say that.  what i meant to say was, "it's interesting that you assert that people shouldn't be offended by jokes."  i was typing fast and then got mixed up, oops.  however, you can easily figure out what i meant by reading what came after that.  kind of embarrassing that you thought i meant something else considering the context... yikes!  you have a problem with people being offended by jokes.  we know this.  i never implied that certain jokes shouldn't be allowed, so you're in fact using a logical fallacy, actively throwing your argument down the drain.  good job.  i never called you sexist, but it doesn't take a genius to figure out that the joke is sexist.  whether or not it is offensive to someone or not is up to that person.  \textbf{sexism} is defined as, "prejudice, stereotyping, or discrimination, typically against women, on the basis of \textbf{sex}."  the joke in question matches this definition because it stereotypes women as not being able to listen and only hearing what they want to hear, if i remember the video correctly.  whether you find it funny or not, it is in fact inarguably true that the joke is sexist.  it is up to you whether you find sexist jokes or at least some of them funny or not.  I already explained calling you childish, so it would be tiring to have to go over that again.  strange that you think i lack reading comprehension while you couldn't actually be bothered to read my comment regarding exactly what you are telling me now.  if you read it, you wouldn't have to be explaining to me what you are calling me a hypocrite for.  it's hard to explain to you when you haven't actually read what i said in my previous comment, so go ahead and read it.  i don't know what your point is at this point.  I guess it would make more sense to say that people's overall opinion toward the joke is what we are talking about.  i really hope this isn't the way you talk to people in real life, by the way.  you will soon find out how much that just won't work for you.  ask yourself this:  why is it bad for someone to be offended at a joke?  should everyone have the same opinions as me?  should \textbf{nobody} ever be offended?  will using bullying as an argument tactic actually further my point and enhance my argument?  maybe answering these will help you actually think critically for once.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nobody, Sex, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/438 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.685 \\  \hline

"if it is a joke, you shouldn't be offended."  who the fuck cares?  anyone is free to feel however they want.  i promise you you will be okay if someone is offended by a joke.  you will be perfectly fine... unless something is very wrong with you.  i know your probably just skimming through this right now counting out how many times you're going to call me a \textbf{pussy} in attempt to hurt someone else to make up for your lack of self esteem, but just continue reading for a moment to consider this example:  who's saying it?  say a jewish person makes an anti-Semitic joke.  next, say a neo \textbf{nazi} says the same joke.  context matters.  your argument is one of the most unintelligent i've ever heard.  however, the thing is, you probably think you're edgy for laughing at \textbf{sexism}, \textbf{racism}, etc and maybe the only option here is to wait a few years until you violently cringe at your past self.  it might take a while considering how you are covering your eyes and ears and screaming your head off to avoid any argument that contradicts your own.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nazi, Racism, Sexism, pussy & \cellcolor{green!5} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General, Nationality - Chinese & \cellcolor{green!5}5/373 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.34 \\  \hline

On the same premise I could say that harrassing buddhists is \textbf{sexism}. That's the type of error you're doing here. You should actually learn the meaning of words before using them.
