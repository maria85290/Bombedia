  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Most people aged 18-25 didn't even bother to vote in the \textbf{Brexit} referendum. This whole thing of young generations being proEU is just more fake news and a narrative created by some media outlets in order to further their own choices. If it had been the other way round and young people had voted for \textbf{Brexit}, they would be saying that it is just the decision of naive and deluded people.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small you cannot argue with the fact that young people do not usually have money in the bank, the project of raising kids done or almost done and a house paid off. Or that older people do not usually want to study abroad, travel the world and may have a lifestyle where you can afford a few years of crisis. the \textbf{old} peoples good \textbf{old} days of rotary phones, navy blue passports and endless war stories are not the good \textbf{old} days of the young. their good \textbf{old} days will be the years before brexit\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Brexit, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Nationality - European or anti-Europeans & \cellcolor{green!5}5/94 & \cellcolor{green!5}5.319 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I'm 27, I voted to leave the EU as I didn't want this country to turn into a vassal and over my dead body this country will turn into a Socialist shithole like Venezuela, stupidity is not exclusive to certain \textbf{age} groups otherwise Jeremy Corbyn and Bernie Sanderrs wouldn't be Socialists.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I find it quite amazing that some young people can \textbf{slag} of the older generation as if they are incapable of rational thought. The young of the past were far more intelligent and resourceful than these Millenniums. What have they done to earn their part in British society? At the \textbf{age} of 25 Guy Gibson led the raid on the dams in Germany during the Second World War. The oldest member of this crew was 29! They, and many many other young people fought and died to maintain the the independence and sovereignty of this country and it's people. And the youth of today  think they,  the past generation are worthless, that they 'haven't done much'!

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Unless you are a young historian, The only possible way you could have personal experience of seeing the trajectory of the EU dictatorship, since its inception, is to have lived through it. We older people saw what it started off as, a benign \textbf{common} trading market. But since 1992 it has become more and more dictatorial, issuing diktats from on high to \textbf{nation} states very often not what we would want. It's not democracy, we're not allowed to control our borders and we have to pay over a fortune for no good reason.  But a young person will have been brainwashed by the educational establishment that the EU is something good that we should stay in.  I recommend young people should watch \textbf{Brexit} the Movie for a better understanding.  Once you've seen that you'll see why people voted to leave. It's basically turned into something that's no longer good for this country - that is, if it ever was.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Brexit, Common, Nation & \cellcolor{green!5}Nationality - European or anti-Europeans, Nationality - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}3/159 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.887 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small To the entitled little \textbf{Snowflake} who will have achieved the square root of fuck all in her short life all I will say is this:As a 70 year \textbf{old} it is people like me who YOU wish to ignore and disenfranchise, simply because we hold a different point of view, that built this country over (in my case) 52 years of hard graft. You demonstrate your ignorance and your weakness by thinking its perfectly OK to be intolerant of others and, when challenged, make a personal attack like 'you haven't done anything'. How do you know WHAT that man has or has not achieved. Whatever it is it is clearly far more than you have.YOU now wish to hand away what me and people like me built to an unelected bureaucracy. I will not stand by and do \textbf{nothing}. As I didn't when I served my country for 15 years and went to war. You are a perfect example of why the young need protecting from themselves sometimes. Because as this man courageously pointed out: We have the life experience and you do not.I voted for Ted Heath in '72 and voted Remain in '75 when it was the EEC and just about Trade with 8 other similar countries. FoM was no issue as it was about 30,000 a year. I worked in Germany and knew Germans who worked here. No problem. Where it has gone wrong is the Socialists created the 'EU' and a political project to become a United States of Europe, our Governments were conned or (in Labour's case) connived with it and we were never asked to join the EU. It was foisted on an objecting population. And then in 2004 Labour failed the country completely by opening the floodgates in uncontrolled mass migration from an EU of now 27 other countries, 12 of whom were utterly poor ex \textbf{communist} countries, 7 years earlier than anyone else to simply 'rub the Right's nose in diversity'! Bastards! And then invented 'Tax Credits' so that large companies could employ these thousands of migrants on low wages to increase profits! And we, our schools, our NHS and our housing have suffered the consequences ever since.Young lady. When you have earned a few T Shirts, been around a few blocks and maybe got your soft hands dirty with hard graft then get back to us.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Too true, my mind was made up more than 20 years ago, I longed for a referendum. The UK is a strong, independent and capable \textbf{nation}, why should the lion bow to the will of the hyenas on the continent?

I am much older than she. I am also much more worldly and much more informed and better educated than she is. I can also fathom out for myself that denying someone the right to a vote because a; they are not informed enough (although judging by her standards, I cannot imagine what level she would set this at), or b; they do not have enough time to live. This  is one of the most singularly vile and disgusting concepts that I have heard. Maybe she really does want to live in a totalitarian state. If people were to be disenfranchised, one of the first criteria for realignment would be the \textbf{age} of the voter. 18 is way too young; however, we have to start somewhere. It is interesting that the areas where a strong majority of the electorate vote Labour is amongst; those in full time education (students and full timefurther education drones) and the permanently unemployed. Both categories should have the right to vote removed from them.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/195 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.513 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The millenials think that the older generations have all maliciously and deliberately added debt to the national economy that they have to pay for. The baby boomers did benefit at a time in the past in a manner people today can not, and it is true that in many ways this has disenfranchised certain aspects of the youth population,  but the unexperienced, mal-educated (indoctrinated) uni kids of today have gone one step further and assumed that the generations before them have political apathy and aren't worth listening to, nor are they deserved of their lawful right of a political voice.This is a shame, because experience defeats "education" everyday. There used to be a time where the majority of your teachers had previous work experience in their field, so you were at least getting second-hand experiences. Today, most teachers are "career" teachers; just as bad as politicians and touting their own brand of ideological waffle.This scenario also has the added consequence that the millenials typically express bigotry towards anybody with more life experience: easily identifiable in a person on account of \textbf{age} ie. you can tell by looking at them they've been around longer, therefore the chances are he/she has more relative experiences than you. This dismissal is inherently unnatural of human beings; in most cultures the older and wiser, the more revered you are.Interestingly, and paradoxically, it is this way of indoctrinating students to whine on in lack of experience that has caused the teacher to lose control in the classroom in 21st century UK. They do not respect their elders as a default position.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/268 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.373 \\  \hline

So it must be from the remain side itself who's only form of attack seems to be a poor effort to shame voters into changing their minds...Sorry but you cannot shame people who hold no shame, but who voted with a clear conscience against the UK's membership of a corrupt , non democratic organisation. Even if the EU was democratic, many would have still voted to leave, can the remain side not see that as the EU gains more centralised decision making , each countries citizens influence becomes more diluted... Eventually the role of a member states government will have no more power at decision making than your local/parish council....But that aside I personally voted to leave to empower the UK, to enable the economy to grow , to enable the UK begin positive trading within expanding economies, to enable the UK to become the \textbf{nation} that set the standards in safety, build quality, building codes etc.. I realised that outside of the EU we are better able to react quickly to global changes rather than reaching half baked compromises due to the vestige interests of 27 other nations, a compromise that is only reached after endless months of inaction and pontificating.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Lame, Nation & \cellcolor{green!5}Nationality - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}2/247 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.81 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The economy was in trouble due to militant socialist workers who crippled major industries through strike action.  It had \textbf{nothing} at all to do with "losing the Commonwealth" - that is still there and going strong.  What changed was that we abandoned preferential treatment for Commonwealth products in favour of European ones.  So we didn't join the EEC to recover from a deficit left by the Commonwealth, quite the opposite.  Your points about the effects of strike action are valid, but we were already in the EEC by then.  The EEC/EU has done \textbf{nothing} for British Industry,  We have traded at a deficit, which gets worse every year, with the EEC/EU nations since we joined.  We are currently running a £120 billion deficit with the EU nations - that is manufacturing activity that could be sourced at home but is sourced on the continent instead.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}2/145 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.379 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small +stoufer2000   The reason why Britain was in a bad way was because of the all powerful closed shop unions. The unions brought down three governments. That was until Margerat Thatcher came along.  Over on the continent Germany re industrialised with an American bailout.   They did it very quickly, within 5 years after the war while Britain was still on rationing and austerity because of Ww2 debts. We had to go to the commonwealth because of labour shortages. ironcally it was the unions who objected to the immigrants.  They marched on parliament citing their jobs were at risk. It was the conservative government ironically who brought the first postwar carribean immigrants to man the public sector jobs.  France banned \textbf{coloured} immigration right up until the 1970s until there was labour shortages also.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small We were on a hiding to \textbf{nothing} following the war. early 50's great, Clement Attlee really kicked things off well with a bit of Keynesian investment. UK industry had had a kick in the teeth trying to compete with the Marshall plan funded Germany and Japan tho as they rebuilt. We had the engineering skill and could have developed it but we were living in cloud cuckoo land if we thought we could still keep exporting pre rusted badly designed and built shit to the \textbf{old} empire when they could get a cheap, reliable and by now better Honda or Datsun or VW to do the job. Plenty of Tory gov's post Attlee had the chance to both sort out the unions a little, and try and capitalise on our skill by investing properly in industry, but they didn't. By the time of the Wilson and Heath gov's, it was already too late, and the union stranglehold was an extreme reaction to the predicament we were in. (erm just like we are seeing now, but to the populist right). Political extremes not usually good either way...When we did join the EEC and favoured european products, look what happened.. 5th largest economy! Ob a lot of this of this wasn't to do with the EU and was mostly your mates the Tories selling off everything that wasn't bolted down for a quick shekel, dubious city  dealing and pushing consumer credit like it was going out of fashion.. Having said that, the EU has also been responsible for some of this turnaround. Hi tech European Companies that offer real skilled employment, an easy trading environment with mostly like minded partners, what's not to like?

This can be achieved by successive steps, each disguised as having an economic purpose, but will eventually and irreversibly lead to federation."I'm no fan of the Tories OR Labour, but how is unlimited immigration going to give us more housing? How is unlimited immigration ever going to improve the lives of the least well off in society? You don't need to read economics for dummies to realise that a surplus of workers combined with a dearth of jobs will ALWAYS keep wages down. The \textbf{Black} Death of the fourteenth century freed the serfs and increased wages- the opposite will obviously DO the opposite.The EU is not some benevolent organisation- it's ran by, and for the benefit of multinational businesses.
