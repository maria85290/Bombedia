  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Arabs are related to other Semitic ethnicities, and of the CAUCASIAN racial group.  Latinos (not referring to Spaniards and Portuguese) are of Spanish, Native American, and often of some \textbf{Black} \textbf{African} descent;    Latinos (from the Americas) are therefore of some Caucasian descent, too.    Caucasians, whether dark, medium, or light complexioned,  are in the broad category of "White".    White RACISTS insist on restricting the definition to ONLY NORDIC (that is: Teutons, Celts, Slavs, Basques), while excluding Mediterraneans, light skinned East Indians, Arabs, Jews, and North \textbf{African} Caucasians.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Race doesn't exist and is outdated and arbitrary grouping of people. For instance, if you are defining \textbf{race} as grouping by genetic similarities you couldn't say \textbf{black} \textbf{race} because there are bigger genetic differences between some of the "\textbf{black}" people than between some of the "\textbf{black}" and "white" people since we all come from Africa and there is more genetic diversity there.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The first J1 men lived in the Late Upper Paleolithic, shortly before the end of the last Ice \textbf{Age}. The oldest identified J1 sample to date comes from Satsurblia cave (c. 13200 BCE) in Georgia (Jones et al. (2015)), placing the origins of haplogroup J1 in all likelihood in the region around the Caucasus, Zagros, Taurus and eastern Anatolia during the Upper Paleolithic.Like many other successful lineages from the Middle East, J1 is thought to have undergone a major population expansion during the Neolithic period.¬†Chiaroni et al. (2010)found that the greatest genetic diversity of J1 haplotypes was found in eastern Anatolia, near Lake Van in central Kurdistan. Eastern Anatolia and the Zagros mountains are the region where goats and sheep were first domesticated, some 11,000 years ago. Chiaroni et al. estimated that J1-P58 started expanding 9,000 to 10,000 years ago as pastoralists from the Fertile Crescent. Although they did not analyze the other branches, it is likely that all surviving J1a1b (L136) lineages share the same origin as goat and sheep herders from the Taurus and Zagros mountains.The mountainous terrain of the Caucasus, Anatolia and modern Iran, which wasn't suitable for early cereal farming, was an ideal ground for goat and sheep herding and catalyzed the propagation of J1 pastoralists. Having colonised most of Anatolia, J1 herders would have settled the mountainous regions of Europe, including the southern Balkans, the Carpathians, central and southern Italy (Apennines, Sicily, Sardinia), southern France (especially Auvergne), and most of the Iberian peninsula. Hotspots of J1 in northern Spain (Cantabria, Asturias) appear to be essentially lineages descended from these Southwest Asian Neolithic herders.Most J1 Europeans belong to the¬†J1-Z1828 branch, which is also found in Anatolia and the Caucasus, but not in Arabic countries. The¬†Z1842¬†subclade of Z1828 is the most \textbf{common} variety of J1 in Armenia and Georgia. There are also two other minor European branches:¬†J1-Z2223, which has been found in Anatolia and Western Europe, and¬†J1-M365.1, also found a bit everywhere across Western Europe. Their very upstream position in the phylogenetic tree and their scarcity in the Middle East suggests that these were among the earliest J1 lineages to leave the Middle East, perhaps as Late Paleolithic or Mesolithic hunter-gatherers that wandered outside Anatolia and, pushed by successive waves of migrations from the Neolithic to the Bronze \textbf{Age}, ended up in Western Europe.Within the Middle East, SNP analysis shows that the¬†J1-L136¬†branch migrated south from eastern Anatolia and split in four directions: Anatolia/Europe (PF7263), the Levant, the southern Zagros (and southern Mesopotamia ?), and the mountainous south-western corner of the Arabian peninsula (mostly in Yemen), bypassing the Arabian Desert. That latter group, consisting essentially of¬†J1-P56¬†lineages, crossed the \textbf{R\textbf{ed}} Sea to settle Sudan, Eritrea, Djibouti and northern Somalia. The climate would have been considerably less arid than today during the Neolithic period, allowing for a relatively easy transmigration across the Middle East with herds of goats.Neolithic J1 goat herders were almost certainly not homogenous tribes consisting exclusively of J1 lineages, but in all likelihood a blend of J1 and¬†T1¬†lineages. So much is evident from the presence of both J1 and T1 in north-east Africa, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, but also in the Fertile Crescent, the Caucasus and the mountainous parts of southern Europe. Maternal lineages also correlate. Wherever J1 and T1 are found in high frequency,¬†mtDNA haplogroups¬†HV, N1 and¬†U3are also present, as well as J, K and T to a lower extent (=>see¬†Correlating the mtDNA haplogroups of the original Y-haplogroup J1 and T1 herders). It is unclear whether goats were domesticated by a tribe that already comprised both J1 and T1 lineages, or if the merger between the two groups happened during the Neolithic expansion, when two separate tribes would have bumped into each others, intermixed, and thereafter propagated together.Bronze \textbf{Age} expansion of J1-P58Kitchen et al. (2009)¬†estimated through a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis that Semitic languages originated in the Levant around 3,750 BCE, during the Early Bronze \textbf{Age}. It evolved into three groups: East Semitic (an extinct branch that comprised Akkadian), Central Semitic (which gave rise to Aramaic, Ugaritic, Phoenician, Hebrew and Arabic), and South Semitic (South Arabian and Ethiopian).J1-P58, the¬†Central Semitic branch¬†of J1, appears to have expanded from the southern Levant (Israel, Palestine, Jordan) across the Arabian peninsula during the Bronze \textbf{Age}, from approximately 3,500 to 2,500 BCE. Camels were domesticated in Somalia and southern Arabia c. 3,000 BCE, but did not become widely used in the southern Levant before approximately 1,100 BCE. Camels played an important role in the further diffusion of J1-P58 lineages, notably with the Bedouins in the desertic parts of the Middle East and North Africa. Bedouins now make up a substantial percentage of the population of Sudan (33), Libya (15), the United Arab Emirates (8) and Saudi Arabia (5).The two most \textbf{common}¬†Jewishsubclades of J1 downstream of P58 are¬†Z18297¬†and¬†ZS227. The latter includes the Cohanim haplotype. Most of the other branches under P58 could be described as Semitic, although only¬†FGC12¬†seems to be genuinely linked to the medieval Arabic expansion from Saudi Arabia.Based on very limited data, the main¬†Lebanese¬†subclades of J1 appear to be¬†J1-Z640¬†and¬†J1-YSC76. Both subclades have also been found in Sicily, Andalusia and Portugal, which suggests that they were already found among the¬†Phoenicians. However, since the Arabs conquered the same regions as those colonised by the Phoenicians, it is too early to reach such a conclusion. Subclades found in Sardinia are very useful as practically all J1-P58 on the island were supposedly brought by the Phoenicians. They include Z18297 (could also be Jewish), Z2324>YP4763, YSC76>FGC15940>ZS1690 and YSC76>FGC8223>FGC8216>FGC8196.Geographic distributionDistribution of haplogroup J1 in Europe, the Middle East \& North AfricaÔøºFrequencies of haplogroup J1 in Europe and West Asia tend to vary considerably from one regional community to the next. The highest local percentages in Europe are found in Greece, Italy, France, Spain and Portugal and hardly ever exceed 5 of the population. However Italy, France and Spain also have areas where J1 appears completely absent. Even in northern Europe, where the nation-wide frequencies are below 0.5, very localised pockets of J1 have been observed in Scotland, England, Belgium, Germany and Poland. Larger sample sizes are needed to get a clearer picture of the distribution of J1 in Europe.Surprisingly, even in the Caucasus and in Anatolia, the region where this haplogroup is thought to have originated, there are wide discrepancies between regions. For example, the Kubachi and Dargins from Dagestan in the Northeast Caucasus have over 80 of J1 lineages, while in their Ingush neighbours, 200 km to the north, it barely reaches 3. East Anatolia around Lake Van sees over 30 of J1, whereas south-west Anatolia has only 2. Even within Kurdistan frequencies vary greatly. The small sample sizes for each region is surely to blame.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Common, Red & \cellcolor{green!5} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Age - General, Ethnicity - Native-American, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}9/1155 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.779 \\  \hline

The term has at times been expanded to encompass certain persons of Middle Eastern, North \textbf{African}, and South Asian descent, persons who are often considered non-white in other contexts. Still today the relationship between some \textbf{ethnic} groups and whiteness remains complex. In particular, some Jewish and Arab individuals both self-identify and are considered as part of the White American racial category, but others with the same ancestry feel they are not white nor are they perceived as white by American society. The United States Census Bureau plans to add a new category to classify Middle Eastern and North \textbf{African} peoples in the U.S. Census 2020. According to Frank Sweet "various sources agree that, on average, people with 12 percent or less admixture appear White to the average American and those with up to 25 percent look ambiguous (with a Mediterranean skin tone)". Scientists told me I am white but it's not traditional. It's the same case with Southern Europeans, Middle Easterners, and North Africans.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Sacred Truth yes what you are saying is true, there are many arabs who are syrian and labanese with a fair complexion, but I think it also depends on where you live in a single country too, for example in some places in palestine there are people with darker skin, where there are places where you find fair skin more, and the same goes for every country so it's fair to say that all countries vary in colors it's just that some have a larger complexion of a color more than other countries.But in the end, why color is something that matters so much is honestly beyond me, I don't think skin color defines who you are or changes anything about you or how much of a good or bad person you are.So seeing people argue about it and hate each other for it disgusts me and how people even judged me for the color of my hair or my skin color that I'm not muslim, or that I don't practice my religion, or that I play around with men just because of my skin and hair color.And how people treat \textbf{black} people as if they're ratchet or ugly or how they treat brown skinned people as if their opressing and terrorists is ignorant.In his farewell speech, the Prophet affirmed that all people are equal like the teeth of a comb and that no Arab is superior to a non-Arab, nor is a white person superior to a \textbf{black} person,¬†unless by virtue¬†of personal integrity and¬†moral rectitude.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!5}2/263 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.76 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@XFiorentti Latino is a place association.  People from Latin American regions I.e. Latin America generally refers to territories in the Americas where the Spanish or Portuguese or French languages prevail: Mexico, most of Central and South America, and in the Caribbean, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Puerto Rico.(it even can include Quebec) ...Hispanic mainly refers to people who have Spanish/Portuguese blood. Latinos are always Hispanic.  But Hispanic people are not always Latinos.  People from Spain/Portugal are Hispanic, not Latino.  They are not from the Americas. There is no "percentage" that you have to be to BE Latino.  You only need Spanish or Portuguese blood and to be born in the Americas. You can also be that and have any combination of other peoples living in the Americas. Creole is determined the same way.  Creoles are people of French or Spanish heritage born in the Americas. American Creoles were often interbred with American natives and \textbf{African}.  But they could also be 100 European.  Creole simply infers the PLACE of birth.  No people born in France, Spain or Portugal are Creole.  All people with French, Spanish or Portuguese heritage born in America are.  American natives are not Creole. \textbf{African} Americans born in America are not Creole.  The key is the connection with Latin Europe (not including Italy or Romania...the romance language countries or latinate countries) and American birth.  So there is overlap with Creole and Latino.  Creole, in general, focuses on French culture and language derivations.  island Creoles speak French or a French patois, (Haiti, Santo Domingo, leeward and windward islands) referred to AS Creole.  Again, no percentages of any particular group is required, except the base groups of some French or Spanish and any other group.

All these factors apply when differentiating a \textbf{race} from one another, and there is plenty of evidence to prove it.Middle Easterns, Asians, Whites, Pacific Islanders, Blacks, etc are all built differently.

I see studies even by respected scholars claiming Iq averages of different racial groups and putting  "arab" in there as if we are a \textbf{race} (yes different races have different IQs thats a fact) ... Based on What ? assuming Iq is genetic and that my brother who is in a gifted program in Saudi I visited their class and not a single one was afro arab(about 30 of saudis are and I was judging by sight of his class when compared with saudi population)  and 2 of students in his class out of 20 were Qurashis and hes the third...they have the saaaaame last name ! and the rest were of beduin pure arab descent... coincidence ? the same \textbf{race} that conquered North Africa and Spain (with berbers)  in the past is now the one conquering aptitude tests in Saudi.I observe these things because I care. I might be biased so if you have comments tell me .  so basically what im saying  Average Iq in saudi is in 80s > majority of students in gifted classes are of arab tribes and not mixed> racial Arabs are about 30 in saudi= arabs have higher average iq than the average saudi and this only follows from the fact that it is unbelievable that a bunch of nomands toppled 2 empires at the time must have been smart, they were OP and needed a nerf. The same thing is gonna happen to caucasians in the west they might get a nerf soon.

Greeks, Romans, Persians were among the first to make that happen.  Hindus did their own thing, a little different than Greeks, a little different than China, where The Art of War was written 500 B.C.   Egyptians?  Those paintings look like Whites who were Engineering and Organizing while Blacks did the work - same as in the world today - including in Africa today.  Asian and Caucasian, similarly industrious, but culturally different. Africans just kinda sing and dance and screw and practice Voodoo and stuff, enjoying simpler things in life, now including basketball, like Native Americans and Native Australians do (except for basketball). FACT: Everyone on earth would be happier if separate races went back to their separate places, so that they could be whatever they want to be, industrious, people of science and industry, or, 'soul men'.  USA/CAN/MEX (aka, North America, aka, Nordica)?  For whatever reason, the Natives were wiped out by Plague of Pox, and no longer exist but in very small numbers, and anyone who thinks that anyone but \textbf{Whitey} built the USA as it is today is just plain stupid, so, North America is now \textbf{Whitey}-Land just as much as Europe.  Africa can and should be left alone, so that Blacks can be whatever they want to be, which is a Matriarchal Society, led by women who are stupid enough to do the boring and hard work around the village while men go out hunting all day and come back to the village at night to screw - just like Native Americans, and the Pre-Greek-Europeans once did too (with high infant mortality, but, really, so what?).

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Who Do You Think You Are?Family names and genetics seem to be more important to some than others, but overall human interest in where we come from is  an innate trait. How do you see yourself?Scientists have tried to say we originated in Africa definitively, but this has not been scientifically proven. But without dispute, the ancient civilizations of Mesopotamia, Canaan, Anatolia, Egypt and Caucasus later became the Middle East, Northern Africa and Turkey. They have a very ancient and documented history.  The migration patterns related to ancient trade routes show some interesting genomes for these areas. The Arabian Peninsula prides itself on thinking that they are pure Arab, but science can dispel it. In 2005, National Geographic did a genographic study with DNA analysis to break down these various regions. It showed as follows:Kuwait 84 Arab 7 Asian7 \textbf{African}Lebanese44 Arab14 Jewish11  North \textbf{African}10 Asian5 Southern European Egypt68North \textbf{African}17 Arab4 JewishNon Arab countries Iran56 ArabEthiopia 11 ArabOther ‚Äì Askenazi Jews 10 Arab From 500 000 samples in 3 areas, Turkey is 35-45  Middle Eastern and 38-40 European with some Central and South Asia in all areas.  Saudi Arabia is 90 Arab with 10 Afro-Asian. I question those numbers as there are Saudi's that are \textbf{African} descendants from slavery but were nationalized in 1962. The previous census is not well classified to help identify \textbf{ethnicity}. Genome information was not available for Saudi Arabia or the UAE. A small UAE sample showed a complex mix of Saudi, Jordanian, Iranian, Pathan and Cypriot descent done in another study. In Yemen, studies were limited but a small gene sample in 64 specimens showed \textbf{African} and \textbf{Indian} genes based on their location on this genome map.(Research Gate, August 2010) See map attached.Arab migration patterns even extended west. North American civilizations are younger than the Middle East, however there is documentation of Arab immigration to the US in the early 1800's.  Syrian Lebanese immigrants began immigration to Canada in the later 1880's. Both moved due to the same political socioeconomic reasons that motivate people today. We are all mixed and we are all humans with the same drives and ambitions regardless of our \textbf{ethnicity}.

Instead, archaeological, religious and linguistic evidence confirm that they are a northern¬†Arabian tribe.[The precise origin of the specific tribe of Arab nomads remains uncertain.

Not what we see as being white is in the world today and as long as I live. No matter what anyone says, they will never be white as a people.

Skin color does not denote \textbf{race}.The genetic structure of the world's first farmers We report genome-wide ancient DNA from 44 ancient Near Easterners ranging in time  between ~12,000-1,400 BCE, from Natufian hunter-gatherers to Bronze \textbf{Age} farmers. We show that the earliest populations of the Near East derived around half their ancestry from a ‚ÄòBasal Eurasian' lineage that had little if any Neanderthal admixture and that separated from other non-African lineages prior to their separation from each other. The first farmers of the southern Levant (Israel and Jordan) and Zagros Mountains (Iran) were strongly genetically differentiated, and each descended from local hunter-gatherers. By the time of the Bronze \textbf{Age}, these two populations and Anatolian-related farmers had mixed with each other and with the hunter-gatherers of Europe to drastically reduce genetic differentiation. The impact of the Near Eastern farmers extended beyond the Near East: farmers related to those of Anatolia spread westward into Europe; farmers related to those of the Levant spread southward into East Africa; farmers related to those from Iran spread northward into the Eurasian steppe; and people related to both the early farmers of Iran and to the pastoralists of the Eurasian steppe spread eastward into South Asia.

However, mtDNA analysis shows elevated frequencies of haplogroups \textbf{common} in West Eurasians only in northwest India.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small honestly, I favor the Arab notion of \textbf{race} over the White-American's. The Arabian perception of \textbf{race} is fluid, Arabs consider everyone with a one-drop of Arabian blood as an Arab, and even those with no Arabian blood at all, but speak Arabic or were born in an Arabian community/country, are considered Arabs. They view Arabianism more as a culture than a \textbf{race}, in terms of bloodline I mean. Contrary to White-American notion of 'whiteness',  whereas everyone with a one-drop of non-white blood is completely excluded from the white \textbf{race}, let alone if they spoke fluent English or were born and raised in a white community/country and lived there for over 400 years, they have no chance of becoming white.Take me for example, I'm bi-racial, I was born to a \textbf{Black} and Arab parents, but I identify as \textbf{Black}, because my physical features are more \textbf{Black} than Arab. But I can still identify as Arab if I wanted to, and I wouldn't face any backlash from Arabs, but in fact I'd be celebrated. Too many of my Arab friends stress that I'm an Arab whenever the topic of \textbf{race} is brought up. But a person like Barack Obama, who was born to a White mother, hence 50 White, could never become White, he wouldn't even be considered bi-racial, because then they'd acknowledge the fact that he's half White, which I believe is the main reason behind the whole 'one-drop of \textbf{black} blood rule', to keep the white bloodline pure, which is \textbf{racist}, and to keep non-whites, specifically blacks, from enjoying American rights and participating in American politics, which is also \textbf{racist}.But of course the fluid, liberal-like Arabian perception of \textbf{race} isn't perfect, it has its disadvantages as well. I have mentioned that Arabs view \textbf{race} as a culture, and 'culture' in the Arabian definition is centered around religion, so becoming Arab means becoming Muslim, and adhering to the Arabian culture of Islam. Every child born to an Arabian family, doesn't matter whether the father is Arab or the mother or both, is automatically considered a Muslim, and is expected to follow the Arabian culture of Islam. Which I believe is the main reason behind the whole "Who he speaks a fluent Arabic tongue is an Arab" Hadith by prophet Muhammad, to further Islam and pave the way for it to dominate the world through \textbf{race}.That, and the fact that it completely strips off bi-racial persons of their non-Arab half, it doesn't matter if you're Micheal Blackson \textbf{black}, if you have a minimal relation to Arabs, you're 100 Arab and don't get to claim the culture of your second half. Which is the main reason why \textbf{Black} Muslims, specifically those biologically related  to Arabs, such as East Africans, have a huge problem with the Arabian perception of \textbf{race}. But more and more people are dropping these \textbf{race} perceptions based on bloodline and religion and adapting the one true perception of \textbf{race} that is based on humanity. Whether we are Arabs, Whites, Blacks or Muslim or Christian, in the end we are all humans, we all come from the same place (Africa), we all descend from the same \textbf{common} ancestors (Apes).\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Common, Race, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}20/531 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.766 \\  \hline

The word was used by the¬†Indic people¬†of the¬†Vedic period¬†in¬†India¬†as an \textbf{ethnic} label for themselves and to refer to the noble class as well as the geographic region known as¬†ƒÄryƒÅvarta, where¬†Indo-Aryanculture was based.[2][3]¬†The closely related¬†Iranian people¬†also used the term as an \textbf{ethnic} label for themselves in the¬†Avesta¬†scriptures, and the word forms the¬†etymological¬†source of the country name¬†Iran.[4][5][6][7]¬†It was believed in the 19th century that Aryan was also a self-designation used by all¬†Proto-Indo-Europeans, a theory that has now been abandoned.[8]¬†Scholars point out that, even in ancient times, the idea of being an "Aryan" was religious, cultural and linguistic, not racial.[9][10][11]Drawing on misinterpreted references in the¬†Rig Veda¬†by Western scholars in the 19th century, the term "Aryan" was adopted as a¬†racial category¬†through the works of¬†Arthur de Gobineau, whose ideology of \textbf{race} was based on an idea of blonde northern European "Aryans" who had migrated across the world and founded all major civilizations, before being degraded through¬†racial mixing¬†with local populations. Through the works of¬†Houston Stewart Chamberlain, Gobineau's ideas later influenced the¬†\textbf{Nazi} racial ideologywhich saw "Aryan peoples" as innately superior to other putative racial groups.[12]The atrocities committed in the name of this racial ideology have led academics to avoid the term "Aryan", which has been replaced, in most cases, by "Indo-Iranian".

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Amina Smily sorry to pop your westerners outlook bubble.  Arab is a \textbf{ethnic} identity that is from Ishmael, of the Bible too the present day. To be frank about it. And the western idealisms goes away from the truth by saying - if any body lives the lifestyle as the arabs, they are arabs. I disagree with THAT thinking Because That's "NOT" biblically correct. \textbf{Witch} I can see the confusion. Maybe, yes The we can presume they are arabs because of cultural beliefs and the Arabic tongue the adopted as their own because of Arab control. For the longest time any land arabs controlled I always believed as a young kid. The people that the Arabs conquered and assimilated with the people they conquered as Arabs. Example the people of Iran. As a kid I thought they had Arab blood running in they're veins because that's what the Vikings done in Europe. Conquer and assimilate. Long story short I studied and getting educated. And what I gather Iran for as a example maybe a handful more or less has Arab blood in their veins. Example on that is ayatollah Khomeini is claimed to be from Muhammad. And from my understanding is from the descendancy  of the children of Ishmael on the Arabian peninsula. Again Arabs are a \textbf{ethnic} identity \textbf{nothing} more or less.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Let's just clear some misconceptions, even some in this video. Today majority of so called "Arabs" are cultural Arabs, in other words they speak the language etc. Only a small percentage are genetically Arab. Most of the Arab nations today are descendants from indigenous races that lived in those lands, that later adopted Arabic as language. Example of some stupidity in this video, she showed so many different countries, though they are considered Arab only because they speak Arabic, but they are clearly proper \textbf{black} Africans some of them example Somalia, Sudan, Djibouti etc. As for white skin etc and being white, many of the people of the levant(Lebanon, Syria, Palestine etc) have white, to pinkish white, to olive skin, which is not a to dark colour, though they \textbf{tan} in the sun. They are very closely related to many people throughout the Mediterranean. Also just because people are white from Middle East doesn't mean they are descendants from Europe? Lol that's stupidity, this white skin etc was already in the Middle East thousands of years before any Europeans set foot in the Middle East. Now as for being classified white, well they ain't white in the sense of an Anglo white, Northern European white. They are another type of white, similar to Southern Europeans example Sicilians, Calabrians, Greeks etc. They also come under the Caucasian \textbf{race}, all middle eastern people have Caucasian skulls.

The majority of Armenians can be traced to the former 3 regions, as only about 20-25 of Armenians now have majority R1b (Caucus) DNA. Caucus Armenians look significantly different from Mesopotamian/Iran/Anatolian Armenians, as they are whiter and have more European features.  Present-day Armenia (which was enslaved by the Soviets after the Genocide) is comprised mostly of Caucus Armenians, as the rest were forced out of their land due to constant persecution by the Turks throughout the 1800s and 1900s (up to the Genocide).

Hence, caucasian never equaled white by definition. There really is no such thing as the "white" \textbf{race}, just subgroups of the Caucasian \textbf{race} that have white skin. But in terms of the social classification, the "white" \textbf{race} was created by WASPS to classify Europeans.

The genetic composition of Europeans as a whole is significantly different from that of Middle Easterners, North Africans, and South Asians---groups that were all lumped with Europeans/Whites 200 years ago. With the exception of Sicilians and Anatolian Greeks who migrated to Europe during the genocide committed by the Ottoman Empire's, the majority of Europeans have a high R1b gene composition (which is the fair-skinned gene type that creates the lightening of skin, hair and eye color), is hardly found in those other \textbf{ethnic} groups.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Nariman M. I think your biggest issue here is that you're continuously trying to make \textbf{race} on the Census a scientific concept. The truth is, it never was and never will be. The scientific concepts regarding \textbf{race} (skull structure) didn't come into inception until the 1800s. The original criteria for \textbf{race} classification was language, and beginning in the 1600s it was phenotype (i.e. skin color). So throughout history, \textbf{race} and \textbf{racism} were predicated on things the naked eye/ear could see/hear. When Africans, for example, were enslaved and mistreated in the Americas beginning 400 years ago, the overt \textbf{racism} of whites towards them was predicated on their skin color. I don't think anyone gave two shits about the structure of their skull. And clearly, science has always taken a backseat to social perception when it comes to \textbf{race} on the Census because why else would East Asians, Native Americans, and Pacific Islanders be identified as three separate races when they all are said to be members of the same \textbf{race} ("\textbf{Mongoloid}")? And why would Indians, originally considered "Caucasoid", all be labeled under the "Asian" category on the Census today---under the same \textbf{race} as East Asians (Mongoloids) no less? And do how you explain the addition of the Hispanic/Latino category when such didn't exist on any form of the original \textbf{race} models? Your savior Blumenblach would be rolling over in his grave! Well, the reason behind modern \textbf{race} concepts as they to pertain to the Census is simply for more easily identifying and categorizing people by their phenotype per American societal standards and perceptions. You focus so hard the scientific side that you fail to realize that the purpose of \textbf{race} on the Census today is to identify the majority \textbf{race} and protect socially-perceived minorities from discrimination (thanks to practices like affirmative action, for instance). \textbf{Race}, in American society, is a social concept. 90 of the population probably don't even realize that Saudi Arabians and Anglos are considered members of the same \textbf{race} per the original \textbf{race} model. Most of them also don't realize that Hispanics/Latinos are simply mixtures and weren't even factored into the original \textbf{race} model. And let me ask you this, do you think \textbf{racist} whites look at North Africans and Middle Easterners and say, "Hey, we have the same skull structure! Welcome to the Klan, brother!"? And do you think white employers when viewing the name "Khalid Abdul-Rahman" on the Census say to themselves, "Hey, why shouldn't I hire this guy? Who cares about the issues in the Middle East! We have the same skull structure!"? Obviously not. \textbf{Racism} is predicated on phenotype, not anthropology, hence \textbf{race} on the Census is categorized under similar practices. That's what you need to realize. So, when you keep going back to your scientific mumbo-jumbo to argue against Middle Easterners and North Africans being classified separately from whites, you take a look at the U.S. Census today. Then maybe you'll realize that science has had little bearing on its current setup. The reasons I've listed are why MENA people should be categorized separately from whites/Europeans.

If you'd read what I wrote earlier, you'd know that I've already stated the Census isn't necessarily "scientific". You're repeating an argument from previous posts that was already answered. But what do you mean it "never will be"? Can you predict the future now? Why even say such a thing? "The scientific concepts regarding \textbf{race} (skull structure) didn't come into inception until the 1800s."Here we go again - you're conflating the concept of \textbf{race} with "skull structure", as though to say that since some of the beginnings of the concepts of races were misled or erroneous, then the baby has to be thrown out with the bath water even though the science since then has grown exponentially and become far more advanced and accurate.

So throughout history, \textbf{race} and \textbf{racism} were predicated on things the naked eye/ear could see/hear."Actually, bone structure, culture, customs, language, pigmentation, facial structure, pigmentation and other phenotypical features were all primarily used as the science of races and ethnicities were forming and as the scientific method was also developing to maintain certain criteria and standards for accuracy and discovery. But what does that have to do with the topic at hand? "When Africans, for example, were enslaved and mistreated in the Americas beginning 400 years ago, the overt \textbf{racism} of whites towards them was predicated on their skin color. I don't think anyone gave two shits about the structure of their skull."Africans weren't seen through that specific lens in the Americas only, nor were they only seen as different only because of their skin colour. The primary indicator that they're "different" from the rest of the Middle Eastern, Mediterranean, European and Asian stock was skin colour, which was always known for as long as knowledge of 'black' people had existed outside of Africa, but further proof for the less obvious differences was discovered through analysis of the bone structure, teeth, hair, and later on the specific genetic groupings and distinctions present. "And clearly, science has always taken a backseat to social perception when it comes to \textbf{race} on the Census because why else would East Asians, Native Americans, and Pacific Islanders be identified as three separate races when they all are said to be members of the same \textbf{race} ("\textbf{Mongoloid}")?"That's because they're not strictly the same \textbf{race} of people. \textbf{Mongoloid} is the larger racial group the former two belong to, but the differences between them are still very much noticeable and confirmed through genetic testing. As for the Pacific Islanders, they're not as related to Eastern-Asians as many assume, because their populations are mixed with Australoid and other ancient, isolated and distinct genetic stock.None of that has any thing to do with the census, however. The census has many reasons not to be accurately scientific, nor was it always based on reliable science. This is in part a discussion of "what is" and "what has always been" versus "what should be". The inclusion of social perception is key because most people aren't educated enough to know their own precise genetic make-up. To clear confusion, the social perceptions of people in the U.S. as well as people among the migrating groups must be included in determining how accurately people can identify their own background. "And why would Indians, originally considered "Caucasoid" all be labeled under the "Asian" category on the Census today---under the same \textbf{race} as East Asians (Mongoloids) no less?!"That, again, speaks to the lack of scientific accuracy in identifying what people's origins are. Indians are less \textbf{Mongoloid} and far more Caucasoid/Australoid, but depending on the region in India from which the individuals or families have migrated, that answer could change drastically. To clear confusion, it seems the geographic placement of countries in their respective continents seems in part to be at play here. None of this means that the Census is correct in fudging accuracy in order to avoid confusion - it's just an explanation for how perceptions aren't necessarily based on hard science. "And how you explain the addition of he Hispanic/Latino category when such didn't exist on any form of the original \textbf{race} models? ... Most of them also don't realize that Hispanics/Latinos are simply mixtures and weren't even factored into the original \textbf{race} model."Why would we be using the exact formulations from "the original \textbf{race} models"? It's fairly clear that genetic and racial studies have made progress in leaps and bounds over the limited original visions of 'racial groups' that the science was identifying in its infancy. I'm not sure if you're transplanting a limited view from the past to the present because of some other limited views from the past, or if you think that because the origin of racial and genetic studies have their roots in less accurate and less complete science, then the whole things needs to be thrown out altogether, which is something scientists haven't done because they can identify with better precision where which parts of the original ideas were flawed or incomplete and to what degree. "The reason for this is that \textbf{race} on the Census is designed to more easily identify and categorize people by their phenotype per American societal standards. You focus so hard the scientific side that you fail to realize that the purpose of \textbf{race} on the Census today is to identify the majority \textbf{race} and protect socially-perceived minorities from discrimination (thanks to practices like affirmative action, for instance)."Wait, what? Are you now describing the opposite of what you're focusing on and saying that I must be focusing on it with as much intent? I focus on the scientific as well as the social and perceptual aspects of such studies and procedures for record-keeping. I don't say it strictly "IS" one way or that it strictly "MUST BE" one other way. I don't doubt that the accuracy and the clarity can both be improved. I only identify 'what currently is' due to both limited understandings of the population groups present in the greater populace and their origins. "\textbf{Race}, in American society, is a social concept. 90 of the population probably don't even realize that Saudi Arabians and Anglos are considered members of the same \textbf{race} per the original \textbf{race} model."Again, that's not merely "per the original \textbf{race} model". That's according to the most accurate, modern scientific models that span across all disciplines of science and research. The original \textbf{race} model, while inaccurate, has been further cemented and clarified using more modern genetic testing and other techniques bio-chemical techniques for identifying genetic and epigenetic distinctions and similarities between varying groups. This is where anthropological, linguistic and historical studies converge with genetic studies of people based on ancient and modern samples to create more snapshots and a better overall picture of which groups interbred and migrated in what patters and directions and to what degrees. I don't doubt that \textbf{race} in 'American society', as well as much of the rest of the planet's national and cultural societies, is extremely limited in contrast to the more accurate genealogical views prevalent in science. ...\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Mongoloid, Race, Racism & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}26/1248 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.083 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small ..."And let me ask you this, do you think \textbf{racist} whites look at North Africans and Middle Easterners and say, "Hey, we have the same skull structure! Welcome to the Klan, brother!"Actually, some (many) do. If you've ever partaken in discussions (or even lurked) on different forums discussing such subjects or overheard debates and musings on the subject, you might realize that many people (white or not) recognize those similarities (\textbf{racist} or not). What does this have to do with "\textbf{racist} whites", per se? Do you care about how \textbf{racist} members of a specific population view accurate scientific and historic data?By that same token, do I care what \textbf{racist} Middle Easterners and North Africans say about European, Middle Eastern, Asian and North \textbf{African} whites that may look different? Are we holding ourselves to lower standards with vindictive counter-views, or are we elevating the discussion and looking at the similarities and differences more realistically, accurately, scientifically, completely and objectively? You seem oddly focused on what a minority of \textbf{racist} whites think and how they operate."And do you think white employers when viewing the name "Khalid Abdul-Rahman" on the Census say to themselves, "Hey, why shouldn't I hire this guy? Who cares about the issues in the Middle East! We have the same skull structure! Obviously not."We're back to the skull structure similarities, apparently - you're not going to convince anyone that the primary driver for the recognition of racial differences and similarities is merely "skull structure", or even that the model used in the past is what stands in the present. You also mentioned "white employers" versus someone with a name that is Arabic. Who's to say that Khalid Abdul-Rahman isn't entirely white in appearance anyway?On the one hand you're making a convoluted case for white discrimination in the workplace which isn't the norm and is in fact the reverse, and on the other linking \textbf{race} with culture and language. Who cares if some minority of white (or otherwise) people may in fact look at differences or similarities instead of professional qualification?Are we speaking of what the bottom of the social barrel may recognize and how they may act correspondingly? Because that minority is neither what "should be" nor "what is". Employers wouldn't be looking at "the census" either way, nor should they. If the person who is identifying himself as what he is base on the choices that were given to him on he census, then his level of education and personal knowledge is more at fault than anything.The people hiring individuals wouldn't and shouldn't be making decisions based on racial or \textbf{ethnic} differences to begin with, so whatever incorrect (or even accurate) ideas they may have regarding those differences or similarities doesn't matter.A white person may choose to hire a different type of white person based on his own specific racial view of the other person's background (for instance, an Igor Komarov may be more related to that person than a Thomas Eisenmann, but he may choose to hire the person with the more familiar last name due to any number of prejudices or incorrect assumptions. Why should that matter to the majority, how they are, and how they should behave?"\textbf{Racism} is predicated on phenotype, not anthropology, hence \textbf{race} on the Census is categorized under similar practices."You went from making a case for what a minority of instances may equate to or represent, to holding \textbf{racism} as the standard that is and should be, to identifying the census as inherently "\textbf{racist}". None of those support one another."That's what you need to realize."So, I need to 'realize' a series of assertions that aren't true or even indicative of how things are for the most part, because you want me to restructure my mind and my thought process to mirror yours? On what intellectual or ethical grounds? The census isn't inherently meant to be "\textbf{racist}" - it may have included more \textbf{racist} intentions behind its existence and encouraged widespread operation, but there's no evidence that it's inherently \textbf{racist} now. A lack of accuracy for a variety of reasons both historical and modern doesn't equate to some simplistic assertion that "\textbf{racism}" is the cause for the existence or the operational standards of the census.If the census was merely "\textbf{racist}" and entirely based on "phenotype", then Latinos and Middle Eastern people would be grouped into one (seemingly) immediately related, combined, magical category. I'm sure the Latinos are also not seen as merely \textbf{racist} or wanting to be distinct due to their racial differences - they are recognized as different AND recognize themselves as distinct from other on average 'darker-complexioned' people due to language, geography, history, culture and even appearance."So, when you keep going back to your scientific mumbo-jumbo to argue against Middle Easterners and North Africans being classified separately from whites, you take a look at the U.S. Census today."Oh, right, so the lack of accuracy due to specific social structures within the U.S. populace have to dictate how people with a scientific mind operate and think? It's funny that you refer to scientific data and then throw it out or dismiss it as "mumbo-jumbo" the moment it doesn't agree with something you'd like to believe as 'reality'. Middle Easterners and North Africans aren't classified separately in science, nor should they be on the census. If you disagree with applying incorrect or prejudiced social standards in determining what people should be allowed to identify themselves as, then how can you justify your own particular, personal, subjective views of what people are and should be seen as without a sense of irony or inflection? Either the method is incorrect, irrational and unethical when it's used in either formulation or direction, or it's not.There's no social or historical cause or reasoning for such a different classification, while there are many accurate, historical and scientific peculiarities determining their inclusion into a broader \textbf{race} with specifics that may need to be mentioned. Middle Easterners and North Africans aren't even necessarily similar or seeing one another as similar outside of anything other than (in some cases) their similar language and customs through their Islamic Arabization. One doesn't have to argue strictly through hard genetic science to determine and establish the differences between Middle Easterners and North Africans as well as their broader similarities that would include all other Caucasoid people.The minor differences that set groups apart can't be reorganized based on subjective viewpoints or racially-biased historical lenses. The major scientifically-confirmed similarities hold more water and are used in/for more educated populations for a reason. If you want to remain dogmatic and ignorant of facts because "the other side" were at one point the same, then you're not providing a solution for everyone, and worse yet, you're only adding to the problem that you seem to be agitated by."Then maybe you'll realize that science has had little bearing on its current setup."Again, it doesn't matter EVEN IF science had "little bearing on its current setup". This isn't a question of strictly what we have, but also what "should be the case". Even if what we currently is in part due to racial and ill-intended historical prejudices, that doesn't mean we have to continue the same practices. In fact, it looks increasingly as though you're both criticizing the reasons for the options and operational methodology of the census as per its past and origins based on your view, AND supporting the process by sticking to a similar type of thought to arrive at a different conclusion.If your 'solution' is just as inaccurate, unscientific and inherently useless, but merely happens to conveniently cater to your own feelings and biases, then it's not a solution or even an accurate view of the world through a sensible view at all.

The term is more closely Western Caspian, Caucasian and Eurasian in origin, and was in use for at least 4000 years before its adoption by the Aryan nobility of India as a separate self-identifying descriptor to set them apart from the darker contemporary native population of the \textbf{Indian} subcontinent. The Europeans never "stole" the definition - the term in its variations has existed within Indo-European languages and early Celto-Germanic mythology since before the migration of the proto-Germanic and Celtic tribes further west into Europe.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Nariman M. Dude, wake up. "Aryan" and the usage of Swastikas were appropriated by the Nazis and that's how the vast majority of the West (specifically America) views it as. People recall it as being Hitler's term to describe the "Master \textbf{Race}" which referred to the pale-skinned whites with blond hair and blue eyes. And people recall Swastikas for being used as a symbol of self-perceived dominance by Nazis over the Jews. You really think the majority of Americans know the actual origins of the term and the usage? Most people think of how it was used during the Holocaust, which was only 70 years ago. Very few people know how it came to be. And furthermore, Europeans did steal the term and distort its original meaning, which had no racial, \textbf{ethnic}, or religious implications in its original definition. I know you have some sort of strange affinity for Europeans and never want to admit to anything they've done wrong, but answer this: who made Aryan a racial term? South and West Asians or Germanic peoples (Europeans)?\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnic, Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/177 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.13 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small First of all, the term 'Aryan' has \textbf{nothing} to do with the Swastika. The appropriation of the Swastika and the term by the Nazis were also FAR MORE recent than the civilizations, cultures, languages and \textbf{ethnic} tribes that came before and used the term in multiple ways. You're back to going by consensus and "what America" views things as. No intelligent person cares about what "people" think even if those people are generally intelligent and knowledgeable, because the truth isn't determined through the assumptions of a misled public. If someone comes along and steals the name of your people or town just to misuse it for ill-intended sociopolitical purposes, does that change the origin, history, legitimacy, permissibility and true definition of that designating term? I should hope not, unless you don't value it. As for the "master \textbf{race}" nonsense, hat's more of the same idiocy that the Nazis attempted to use in order to justify their violence and militant ideology. The majority of the people of Germany and the leadership of the \textbf{Nazi} party weren't even blonde-haired, blue-eyed perfectly white people - the Nazis even fought the most light-complexioned, blonde-haired and blue-eyed people in Europe in their quest for dominance. That should all be obvious by now. You can't use something illegitimate as the pivoting point to judge legitimate information and far more original content by. So, I'll repeat: I don't care about what the majority of Americans think. My question (still) remains, "WHY DO YOU?" Why do you set the bar so low for yourself as to make your reality limited to what is perceived by the ignorant \textbf{common} man? Do you think the average person outside of the U.S. is any better? What about the average \textbf{Indian} or Iranian? What about the average Kurd, Armenian, European, South American, Canadian, Israeli, Egyptian, Nigerian, Korean or Filipino? Now, regarding the origin of the term, I'm sorry that you keep reverting to the revisionist history that you of all people should be opposing - the term Aryan referred first and foremost to a tribe and civilization of people whose origins they self-professed to be "Airyane Vaejahi", the homeland or seed-land of all of their people and series of tribes. The word had no association with nobility until there was a reason for a separation of the "noble" and "ordinary" by classifications that previously didn't exist. Those classifications only became a necessity as the migrating invaders encountered darker ancient people living in the south of the Persian plateau and \textbf{Indian} subcontinent. The mythological origins of the term used as the demonym for all Ariyana far predates new Aryan linguistic and cultural designations used by the Zoroastrian priesthood in the new lands. In fact, the racial and \textbf{ethnic} origins of the term within Iran and the Northern Iranic tribal traditions alone generally predate its usage in cultural and religious references, which themselves predated and gave rise to the modified and more prevalent "nobility" signifier deviously used to separate the races. The roots of the religion itself go as far back as early proto-Indo-European mythology that relate to its European cousins just as the languages and the people did. The fact that much more developed European nations decided thousands of years later to steal the new formulation of the term and misuse it doesn't change its existence as a self-designation for the Aryan tribes that roamed the central-Western Asian plateau and the Eurasian steppe, extending into the Caucasus, near-East and the Caspian corridor. Either you research with an open mind and go past the very surface, or keep re-scratching it and coming up with the same presumptive and misleading corruption of history. I don't get why you're still projecting your own afflictions onto your opposition whenever you face an uncomfortable position or set of information that you can't digest. I have no affinity either way for "European" OR "Middle Eastern" identity and connection, or lack-there-of. My only affinity is to unbiased accuracy and objective truth. You, on he other hand, have always displayed a predilection for preferring a separation of all things wholly "Middle Eastern" by some virtual and supposed unifying identity from all things "European" and "white" by similar variables. Your last assumption is rather revealing: "never want to admit to anything they've done wrong" - huh? When did I ever assert such a thing? You can't really be projecting with such blinding focus as to actually assume I've ever even mildly implied - let alone explicitly asserted - that Europeans "have never done anything wrong". That's a ludicrous position you can't possibly attribute to anything I've ever said here. I can understand that you view them as such unrepentant and unadulterated "evil" that your mission objective is to separate those you choose to see as "your people" from them in every way for all eternity, and you've admitted your hatred and disgust for them more than once here, but how can you really think that reversing your own extreme position and applying its extreme opposite to your opposition is a realistic or constructive way to have a discussion and hope to formulate a successful argument? Mention something "evil" that the Europeans have done - which I've supposedly discounted - if it was ever true or proven, then I'd have no problem agreeing to it. Your included example of "the Holocaust", for instance, is one such example. I might even disagree with the \textbf{common} misconceptions and popularized details of the Holocaust, but I've never excused the Nazis for their role in it, or even the rest of the West and their handlers for funding and enabling the Nazis. As for your last question (that apparently somehow relates to the preceding assumption you made): neither the 'Germanic and European peoples nor the South Asians can be definitively proven to have been the originating source of the term, but since the internal ideas regarding the 'Ariyayi" tribe and their identity goes back to ‚Äì surprise ‚Äì the first Aryan people to begin calling themselves as such, the best evidence for the roots of the term go back to the proto-Indo-Europeans and their language that spawned the Indo-Aryan (P.C. pseudonym: Indo-European) macro-group spreading into South West Asia and Anatolia, South Asia, the Mediterranean and much of the rest of Europe. I shouldn't have to point out your false equivalence of the latter theft of the developed neo-Indo-Iranian term 'Aryan' and its mixture and reincorporation with the European mythological usages of related terms such as Eiru, Heira, Ayre, khiveryu, hiberyo, hiveriu, iweriu, aivirun, phivaria, et al. (spellings not as accurate as they should be because they're difficult to remember, especially with the correct/appropriate characters) by the 19th and 20th century \textbf{racist} ideologues of Europe. Besides, the earlier appearance of words in one language and its related cultures and ethnically distinct nations or tribes doesn't mean that any other appearance of related terms in other languages and cultures is "theft". That would be outright ludicrous and impossible since there are thousands of similar terms spanning between 6000 and 12000 years of Eurasian and meso-Indo-Aryan history across tens of thousands of miles between cultures and people that have never been found to have any contact with one another since their emergence as a distinct group (e.g. the Northern Indians and their predecessor Mitanni with the Northern Germanic or the Western Iberian. There are countless words - and variations thereof - observed in Sanskrit, Avestan, \textbf{Old} Persian, proto-Celtic, proto-Gaelic, proto-Germanic, and even Runic \textbf{old} Norse, most of which have the same etymology and either remaining partial meaning or original definition. If you're going to postulate that all of those distinctly European cultures stole their equivalent words from the South-West Asian civilizations that emerged far from them with no observable contact or migration ever recorded or discovered between them, then we're going to have to bring the discussion back down several levels to even more basic and abstract levels.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Common, Ethnic, Indian, Nazi, Nothing, Old, Race, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Age - Over 65s, Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - General, Ethnicity - Native-American, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}12/1318 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.91 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Nariman M. Well, I'm American. And based on my interactions, I can confidently say that the majority of folks associate "Aryan" and the usage of Swastikas with the "master \textbf{race}" ideology stemming from \textbf{Nazi} hate. You continue to assume that everyone SHOULD know the origins of the term "Aryan", and that they SHOULD be able to separate the \textbf{Nazi} appropriation of such from its original non-racial/ethnic/religious context. The problem is, most folks don't. I understand you're smart, but just because most people don't have extensive knowledge of ancient Eurasian terminology doesn't make them stupid. You think others and I are foolish because we're cognizant of how Holocaust survivors and their descendants might feel about the term? Should we just forget how they feel because the original meaning was something different than the one used as a form of oppression towards Jews? Well, maybe you're just insensitive. People generally associate terms with the way they've been most recently used, not their original context, especially if such origins contrast significantly from its modern definition. So, "Aryan", regardless of its original definition, is considered a hate term now. Look at the Aryan Brotherhood and Neo-Nazis for God's sakes. I think we both know what they stand for, and it doesn't have anything to do with nobility. And what do they employ as their national symbol? The Swastika (even though its design originated in India). And members of such hate groups aren't even all Germans, but they are all of European descent. So, it's simply fact that Europeans are to blame for the hateful appropriation of the term today. Not all Europeans, of course, but it is solely them who employ the term as one of hate. None of its other historical users (South Asians and West Asians) ever did, and that's simply the truth.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nazi, Race & \cellcolor{green!5} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/301 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.997 \\  \hline

Hahaha, welcome to the internet - you're not exactly clever. "the oldest haplogroups of R1a are found in India. Specifically western India at that."Once again, no they do not. Indians don't have the oldest subclade or even a high enough concentration of the oldest subclades of R1a - the Z93 subclade is a diversified M417 (R1a1a) emerging from R1a (M420), which, itself, is widely believed to have occurred 6000 years ago and spread out within the next half-millennia. North Western Iran still contains the oldest subclade of the R1a haplogroup, and all other/newer subclades within the haplogroup are recognized as divergents from that origin. Even Z93 itself originates from central Asia and southern Russia to the East of the Caspian. "\textbf{Indian} people have R1a percentages that are 72, 70 being from the Mohanna tribe of Pakistan. Punjabis are 80 R1a, Pashtuns are 52 R1a. The highest R1a in Europe is found in Sorbs at 62. 99 of western Europe is R1b a much younger clade."You're trying to 'teach' about genetic Haplogroup classifications to someone who has studied genetics and comes from two generations of researchers in the field and even with that said some of what you're trying to say is wildly inaccurate. What you're equating and conflating is R1a with R1a1a and specific subclades of R1a that occur at different rates and variance all across Asia. The "70" of the Mohanna is R1a1a, the occurrence of which is 47 among Pubjabis. Cherry-picking specific percentages isn't exactly impressive, especially in the wider context of the fact that the spread of R1a as associated with the spread of Indo-Aryan and Indo-Iranian cultures further South and East into Asia and towards the \textbf{Indian} subcontinent are already recognized. It's almost like you're trying very hard to validate your country and wider people's "Aryan" status. R1a is almost entirely associated with the Bronze \textbf{Age} expansion of hunter gatherers into the region.  [LINK] "In reality the Indo European \textbf{race} originated from the areas of Northern India notably the Himalaya Mountains which is why Nazis kept going there to look for the real Aryan \textbf{race}."First of all, even you agree that the Nazis were on crack, and were mislead on much of their ideological musings, and yet here you are evidently giving them credit for it when it suits you. Nice try. Secondly, "in reality" your subjective and disproven fantasies have no basis in science or historical evidence of any kind, be it cultural, migrational, ethno-genetic paternal and maternal lineage, linguistic, or even mythological. The people who migrated into India were Indo-Aryans who had developed from the Indo-Iranic proto culture, which itself spread from the theoretical Urheimat in the Eurasian steppe and morphed into several sub-categories multiple times before eventually migrating south from Russia into the \textbf{Indian} subcontinent. I get that you're likely Indo-Pakistani and extremely invested in the ideas of the "Out of India origin" and your "ancestral homeland" being the "categorical main branch" from which all other "Aryans and their lineage" spread, but that idea has been debunked to death, and you may have to get over it and used to the depth and complexity of the story at some point.

"German history is nonexistent before 5,000 years."German history isn't "Germanic history", and even then it's not "nonexistent" - it just doesn't have attested or specific form as 'German' - the preceding cultures and tribes were part of the earlier proto-Indo-European culture from which they emerged. "Romans described them as dirty viking trash who were kept behind a wall."You're honestly a complete and baffling dimwit. It's like you haven't even done the most minor and insignificant amount of research into the Germans. The Romans never called the Germans "Viking", let alone "Viking trash". Also, Roman Caesars, Generals and historians never described the Germans as "trash", and despite being bitter enemies they even went as far as mentioning that they were honourable people, fierce warriors and even kind and hospitable if you approached them as a friend. The same behaviour was observed throughout the Middle East's early migrating Indo-Europeans and Indo-Iranians by all they encountered. As for the Romans, they kept everyone who wasn't 'Roman' behind a wall. Don't be purposefully stupid - they would have kept any other advanced or even superior civilization behind their wall because they acted primarily to preserve and condition their citizens into believing that Rome was paradise and everything outside of Rome was hell (something they also ensured through their military campaigns). They were the evil empire of their time that acted like the U.S. or the British. "There isn't even signs of a pottery culture in Germany let alone Aryan."Calling you a complete moron would be a severe understatement. Aside from the fact that pottery culture in Europe and in the region of modern day Germany is some of the oldest in the world, your understanding of historical cultural art is laughable. ( [LINK]  Even any Aryans and Indo-Europeans who were closely related to one-another didn't produce the same form of pottery - where did you get the idea that the 'Germans' must have 'Aryan' pottery? Besides, what exactly are you trying to argue? You either haven't read anything I've said, or you got triggered (or even brought here as backup) just to babble nonsense as though I ever equated German culture with the South-Eastern R1a cultures of the Middle East, Near-East, Indus Valley and India. In fact, I'm gonna call you out on it directly and ask for you to explain what it is you think I've said or argued here that would prompt anyone to start mentioning the many partially accurate, irrelevant, confused, unrelated and pointless supposed negations of my post(s). Let's start with that - I'll grab some popcorn. "Also the Aryans had a writing system. The Devangari script is a writing system. All Germanic tribes have no writing and copied from Latin which is built from ancient Phonecian."More literally untrue and idiotic nonsense. The "Aryans" to you seem to be "Indo-Aryans" an no one else, but even if that was true and a metric to judge by, your desperate plea to ignore European writing is pathetic. Again, I don't know why you're shooting yourself in the foot with such enthusiasm, but Germanic people have had writing for a long time. Just because they didn't have a recognized system of writing as far back as the Indo-Iranic people of South Asia, South-West Asia and Mesopotamia, doesn't mean they didn't write. The Phoenician alphabet itself derives from hieroglyph form which is based on proto-script systems that are extinct but evidenced. Early writing systems that developed into full-on, large scale written languages existed far before 'Aryan' languages, even as far back as ~6000BCE. Europe and Eurasia had these systems of writing even before any major migration into the Middle East and the fertile or North Africa with a chance and necessity to expand into reliable written systems and scripts for communication between geographically separated tribes across vast swaths of land.

Hahaha, better yet, maybe you can tell me which of the dozens of European nations are "Gog" and which one is "Magog", because the only link anyone has ever tried to make was between the names "Gog" and "Goth" which is easily disproved by the time periods, descriptions and behaviours of the tribes, as well as the total and utter lack of evidence of any kind other than a minor similarity in the name of the latter which comes from a linguistic family completely separate and unrelated to those of the former.

The European knowledge of philosophy also surpassed that of your people within a few recent centuries, in part because they - especially the Germans - have generally not been as self-righteous and full of themselves despite having every right to be. They've cognitively sought, discovered and created solutions to problems that our portion of the world is still suffering from.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Pakistani gangster I get why you think that, but that's a \textbf{common} misconception and no one scientifically refers to J1 as an 'Arab' ethnogenetic Y-DNA haplogroup because 'Arab' isn't a scientific demonymic for a distinct lineage of people bound and recognized by complete genetic or phenotypical similarities. That J1 is \textbf{common} enough in most Arab-speaking populations isn't even close to satisfying the historical and genealogical requirements for classifying or referring to J1 as 'Arab'. It still happens, just as many still refer Azerbaijan as a Turkic \textbf{nation}, or the Israelis as a 'Jewish' \textbf{nation}. J1 covers a wide range of people living across North Africa, the Horn of Africa, Southern Europe, South West Asia and the Middle East. The highest concentration in any 'Arab' population is found in the Yemeni. Whatever matching genetic lineage that followed the spread of J1 and J2 had \textbf{nothing} to do with the Yemeni themselves either. The neolithic Mesopotamian migration into Yemen and elsewhere from Syria and the Levant, Southern Europe and modern day Georgia isn't referred to as 'Arab' until the Bronze \textbf{Age} linguistic and cultural migration that coincided with it and carried much more than J1. Even within the middle East differing populations that are all equally referred to (and seen as) 'Arab' are vastly different in the Y-DNA haplogroups and subclades hey carry. The Kuwaiti population, for example, presents less than half of the Yemeni population's occurrence of J1. Funny enough, the most frequent and least diluted occurrence of J1 (both J-M267 and J-M267-xP58) are \textbf{ethnic} Georgian populations like the Kubachi, Kaytagy and their relatives and cultural brethren whose names, customs and cultural peculiarities are Persian, Georgian, Armenian, Russian and Turkic, and primarily live in Southern Russia in Dagestan, as well as Azerbaijan and throughout the rest of the Caucasus to varying degrees. The majority of the populations across the planet that speak Arabic and carry the culture (people that are commonly referred to as 'Arab') carry such a wide variability of J-M267 occurrence that it would be simplistic to refer to them as ethnigenetic Arab. They don't even look the same. The Sudanese in Khartoum have a J-M267 commonality of over 70, the same as the Darginis of Dagestan, neither of which would ever be seen as or mistaken for 'Arab', but Omanis, Emiratis, Jordanians and Syrians who are referred to as Arab (who also aren't seen as '\textbf{ethnic} Arabs' but referred to as 'Arab' for shared language and similar culture) carry just over 30 J1 on average. The difference among Arabs alone is enough to deter genealogists from referring to J1 as 'an Arab Y-DNA haplogroup or subclade', which would basically be attaching a cultural and linguistic name to an ethnogenetic group classified through DNA markers that they don't coincide or share enough with to be mistaken as such.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Common, Ethnic, Nation, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - General, Nationality - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}7/469 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.493 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Again, no, they're not. There's no such thing as an 'Arab' Y-DNA haplogroup. The haplogroup people think they can freely associate with 'Arabs' doesn't occur nearly frequently enough in all Arabs and in fact occurs in higher frequency elsewhere in populations that have virtually no Arab or Arabic cultural or linguistic influences outside of Islam being introduced to them through other Middle Easterners. A culture and language do not an ethnogenetic DNA group make. I literally just got through explaining and responding in detail to the same claim, and you follow it up with a repetition of the same claim, so no, he's not right and neither are you. Your shallow understanding of genealogy and historical deviation in populations through migration and cultural influences aren't proof of your assertions. You can make the same claim a million times without any evidence or understanding of what you're referring to, but it doesn't change that fact. The original Arabs aren't related to Ethiopians either - they developed out of populations that migrated into Mesopotamia towards the end of the Neolithic period looking for fertile farmlands, and the only known high-frequency carriers of J1 in Africa (throughout Sudan, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia) are known to be mixed with migrating populations of Neolithic farmers from Eurasia and South West Asia. Arabic "in its older form" was even farther away from Africa before developing Arab culture, and North East Africans aren't 'Semitic' by \textbf{ethnicity} because there is no "semitic \textbf{ethnicity}". That doesn't even make any sense. Semites are a linguistic and cultural group that can have some matching genetic traits depending on geographic proximity and shared history that isn't any more significantly \textbf{common} among them than any other haplogroup. Besides, the highest occurrence of J1, as I already mentioned, is in South West Asia in and around the Caucasus. J1 isn't "North East \textbf{African}" - it's a descendant of the GHIJK macro-haplogroup and has only ever migrated into Africa. As for the Turks, I don't know how you could possibly ever manage to bring yourself to the incorrect assumptions that 'Turks are G2', because Turks are a mix of almost every major, distinct, parental European, Mediterranean  Southern-European, Middle Eastern, South West Asian and Eurasian haplogroup as well as minor influences from other regions, but G2 is an infrequent average occurrence in their general population. All subclades of G combined would present a more significant portion of their Y-DNA make-up, but even then you're not looking at anything higher than 11. Pretty much the only thing you got partially right is the fact that J2 occurrence is \textbf{common} among Iranian, Mediterranean and Southern European populations, though even that's simplistic, because Iranians and Southern Europeans, like the Turks, are a mix of various Caucasoid ethnogenetic paternal and maternal haplogroups (the most \textbf{common} Y-DNA haplogroups in Iran being R1a and other subclades of PR at up to 33).

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Nariman M. Whilst there may not be an "Arab DNA group", the J1 haplogroup can be used as evidence to indicate Arabian origin. It may not be absolute proof but appealing to absolute proof is nonsensical when talking about \textbf{ethnicity} and genetics.More than 70 of Yemeni males belong to J1 haplogroup. Saudis have 56 of their population that belongs in the group but that's an underestimation as studies look at residents, not only citizens. Saudi Arabia, like other Gulf countries, have a huge expat community including many who identify as Arabs but may not have Arabian ancestry (about 30 of people in Saudi are not citizens). J1 is frequent enough in Arabia to be considered a good indicator for being Arab. Now countries like Morocco are not mostly Arab to begin with, same with Algeria. That doesn't change the fact that Arabians are a unique group. I'd also add to Arabs south Iraqis (as in area around Basra), the many bedouin tribes outside of Arabia, possibly South Syria and Palestinians as people who are from mostly an Arabian stock.The claim that J1 is found highly anywhere in the Caucasus is from 1 single study. Whether it is true or not doesn't change the fact that within the Middle Eastern context, J1 can be used to determine Arab ancestry. When people refer to Arabs, they refer to the historical ones not the prehistoric people of Arabia.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small "Nariman M. Whilst there may not be an "Arab DNA group", the J1 haplogroup can be used as evidence to indicate Arabian origin."Again, that doesn't even make any sense. It can't at all be used to indicate such a thing when J1 doesn't correspond to the 'Arabian group'. What you just said was self-contradictory. If a large population of people who are from Dagestan and Ethiopia indicate an 'Arabian origin', then we may as well throw out the books and start scribbling whatever we want. There's a difference between stating that J1(J-M267) is found to correlate to peninsula Arab populations as well as other non-Arab populations, and stating that "J1 is Arab". The latter is extremely misleading at best. The original culturally/linguistically Arab population of the Arabian peninsula in the Middle East carried J1, but they weren't the originating source of the haplogroup's appearance, nor were they its only carriers before, during or after the development of Arab culture and ancient Arabic centred around distinct Semitic populations in the northern peninsula and southern Levant. "It may not be absolute proof but appealing to absolute proof is nonsensical when talking about \textbf{ethnicity} and genetics."We're not even close to talking about absolute proof here. We're speaking of likelihoods and rational analysis of possibilities based on evidence. There's no Arab \textbf{ethnic} group, and the people we call Arab comprise diverse people of a wide range of maternal and paternal lineage. Arab is also a term denoting culture and language. So, if you associate J1 with 'Arabs', you've now fooled yourself into thinking that any major carriers of J1 have some likely Arab origin, and that any Arab-speaking people and people of Arab culture are also ethnically related to this same J1 bloodline. Neither of those make any sense in genealogy. It's simplistic analysis and association based on unreliable and occasional correlations that ignore many other correlations and known historical, genealogical, anthropological, linguistic and migratory evidence. You can't go from understanding that it's difficult to draw up exact evidence and concrete, precisely drawn charts and maps of genealogical backgrounds, to muddy and vague maybes and simplistic dreaming up of basic and easy-to-recognize cartoonish associations of whole haplogroups - or primary subclades thereof - with a cultural and linguistic demonym. That's not only unscientific, it's remarkably irrational and nonsensical. Nowhere in genealogy, anthropology or anything even lightly touching on human history would they ever teach you to associate something as precise as paternal Y-DNA haplogroups with cultures and languages. That's why, as I pointed out, people like 'Arabs' and 'Turks', for instance, aren't recognized as an ethnogenetically unique people because of the wide range of genetically distinct groups that those cultures and language groups would comprise. "More than 70 of Yemeni males belong to J1 haplogroup. Saudis have 56 of their population that belongs in the group but that's an underestimation as studies look at residents, not only citizens. Saudi Arabia, like other Gulf countries, have a huge expat community including many who identify as Arabs but may not have Arabian ancestry (about 30 of people in Saudi are not citizens)."I already mentioned the first part about the Yemeni. If you read the complete post you'll realize what I said regarding the frequency of J1 in the Arabian peninsula and where it's known to come from, as well as the fact that most other Arabs (even those in close proximity to Yemenis) don't share anywhere as much of their paternal heritage with the relatively J1(J-M267)-concentrated Yemeni population. The migrational patterns and history of the development of the proto-Semitic migrations of neolithic farmers into Mesopotamia also shows why J1 is most frequent in the Caucasus and surrounding areas first, and that its record of migration matches that of Arabs moving into the peninsula from an external, likely-Caucasian point of origin. That migration continued into Africa, before the development of Arab culture and modern Semitic languages. As for the point regarding Saudi Arabia, it doesn't relate to this, and the \textbf{ethnic} Arab population of Saudi Arabia are in fact tested separately without the inclusion of foreign citizens (this isn't a survey or census we're referring to - it's genetic tests taken of \textbf{ethnic} Saudis -  [LINK]  to reveal an estimated ~40 - including both citizens and residents the mixed population can go either direction, but since \textbf{ethnic} Saudis only show about 40, then the "56" figure you're bringing up isn't for J1 and not of \textbf{ethnic} Saudis. The non-\textbf{ethnic}-Saudi resident population is made up of people from other Arab nations that have about the same occurrence (or slightly less) of the same Y-DNA haplogroups (usually between 30 and 50), and since most come from other countries within the Arabian peninsula and make up 21-33 of the population, if and when they're tested the effect they have on the results should be negligible and mentioned to include a foreign-based population. "J1 is frequent enough in Arabia to be considered a good indicator for being Arab."That's "IN ARABIA", and even then, it's not scientific - it's for hypothetical purposes only - because if anyone is going to go into the trouble of researching and discussing the more accurate data and what it reveals in broader scope, then there's no point inferring that "J1 is Arab and that's close enough, so that will do, and let's just say that anyone carrying J1 of whatever frequency is an Arab". You're referring to something that only has a meaning when it's reflected with true and logical qualification and quantification that portrays the subject matter accurately, so you can't cut corners and rough out ideas. What would be the point, anyway? J1 is "frequent enough" in Dagestan, Ethiopia, Sudan, Israel, parts of Iran and Turkey, Chechnya, Azerbaijan, and other parts of the Caucasus and South West Asia as well. You can't even realistically call J1 "Middle Eastern" - you could refer to it as ancestrally and genealogically \textbf{common} in the Middle East and the Arabian peninsula, but with so much else comprising the 'Arab' populations of the peninsula alone, not to mention the undeniably high occurrence of the same marker in places distinctly outside of the peninsula and the Middle East combined with the fact that J1 didn't originate in the Middle East or the peninsula. There's no rational or even a foreseeably practical reason to simplify this down to \textbf{common} misunderstandings and claim that "J1 = Arab", especially when there's so much wrong with that statement. ...\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Common, Ethnic, Ethnicity & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}8/1079 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.741 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small "Now countries like Morocco are not mostly Arab to begin with, same with Algeria. That doesn't change the fact that Arabians are a unique group."Again, none of this changes anything I said - I already know that Arabs are a distinct group. But what makes them distinct is their language and culture - it's not their \textbf{ethnic} genealogical background. What is shared among certain people that many others of varying physical and cultural traits may also share doesn't make that feature a unique distinguishing one for the first group. "I'd also add to Arabs south Iraqis (as in area around Basra), the many bedouin tribes outside of Arabia, possibly South Syria and Palestinians as people who are from mostly an Arabian stock."That doesn't make any sense. You keep stating what you want, doing \textbf{nothing} to establish or qualify it, then moving on to using it as though it's valid. "Arabian stock" doesn't make any sense. There's no 'Arabian' genetic stock when so many different people are all legitimately referred to as 'Arabs'. South Iraqis, Yemenis, South Eastern Syrians, Jordanians, Omanis, Bedouin Negev and even many Egyptians share similar genetic traits with one another AND people outside of Arabia to varying degrees. "The claim that J1 is found highly anywhere in the Caucasus is from 1 single study. Whether it is true or not doesn't change the fact that within the Middle Eastern context, J1 can be used to determine Arab ancestry." The one mentioned "on Wikipedia" is from "1 study" - there are other studies that place them at around the same frequency and that study didn't exist - nor was it cited - in any of the sources I've come across before in academics, online, literature or vocally attested by any genealogists (it's from 2011). Besides, it's not a truth-by-consensus contest - one study cited and published among peer-reviewed and reliable sources isn't written off simply because it's one study of its kind, especially when corresponding data regarding the genetics of the region largely point to the Caucasus and the near-East (south-west Asia) as the point of origin for many of the modern subclades of GHIJK. There aren't that many studies giving the same precise percentages for the populations of 'Arabs' living in the Peninsula either, despite their populations being nationally distinct. Migration is one the most \textbf{common} amongst the descendants of GHIJK - interestingly, if you look at the dispersion of J1, you'll see that it actually increases in occurrence sharply past Northern and Central Egypt through the Western desert and beyond into North Africa. It's widely believed that North Africa isn't a likely point of origin for the haplogroup subclade, and that any occurrence of both J1 and J2 in and around North Africa are due to older migration which (in the case of J1) can't be singularly attributed to the spread of post-Arab migration, which means that the advent and spread of Islam, specifically, had a great deal to do with the adoption of Arab culture and language as well as Islam as an ideology across North Africa in populations that already contained the same higher than 20 J1 frequency before the spread of Arab culture and language through the Islamization and consequent/subsequent Arabization of the region from the 7th century onward. That Egypt's more commonly-recognized-as-Arab population contains less of the Y-DNA marker "from the Arabian peninsula" than North \textbf{African} populations further west should be interesting in and of itself, but the fact that their equally-considered "Arab" North \textbf{African} regional neighbours and namesakes are even more diverse and still contain the same ancient genetic Y-chromosome markers from before the advent of Arab culture and development of upper-Semitic language groups into ancient Arabic should be telling. "Whether it is true or not doesn't change the fact that within the Middle Eastern context, J1 can be used to determine Arab ancestry."We're getting further and further away from the original claim that I responded to. It's almost like you're beginning to agree with me while posting your comment as a response that attempts to argue against what I'm outlining here. It's not rocket surgery: language is important, and specifying what you mean is key, so if you say "J1 is one of the \textbf{common} ancestral Y-DNA haplogroups shared to varying degrees by many of the Middle East's 'Arab' populations, then you've stated something vastly different from "J1 is Arab", which is so simplistic that it completely changes the meaning of the first statement. You can't really claim that any one particular paternal or mitochondrial haplogroup is distinct to any population that hasn't been isolated for thousands of years, let alone one that has been in frequent divergence, diffusion, connection and mutation with hundreds of other diverse groups and subclades affecting it.

I love how you seem to Google something right after making empty claims about the evidence I provided, just to find something that makes a counter-argument without doing a whole lot of work to actually establish that claim, and you immediately claim it "destroys my claim"! Anyone who claims to have something against their opposition easily makes that claim - it is "the internet" after all! "Conservative speaker DESTROYS liberals on Islamic history." "Leftist politician destroys the alt-right's claims to free-speech." Yeah, we've all heard it a million times before. Besides, you seem oddly willing to Google any one study to try and prove something that you fail to prove, and your "skepticism" is selectively turned off when you do. I mean, anyone can put 'study indigenous Arabs descendants' or a close variation of that string "into Google" and paste the first basically/seemingly agreeable result without reading the long article which I don't think you even bothered to read. If you HAD actually managed to digest and understand both what I said to begin with and what the article you hastily linked to says, you'd realize that it doesn't say "Arabs" should "all be referred to as 'Arabs' in genetics" - it refers to indigenous Arabs within the Arabian peninsula as sharing \textbf{common} genetic ancestry, which I already pointed out, if you'd bothered to read. This differs greatly from the simplistic claim that essentially extracts "anywhere you see J1 it means 'Arab'..." out of regionally-/demographically-varying correlations. If you'd read the article, you'd also realize there's specific reference to "Qataris" denoting Peninsula Arabs, Qataris, Bedouins, Saudis and Yemenis, whereas other 'Middle Eastern' populations of "Arabs" were specifically mentioned in the study as well (Lebanese, Syrians, Egyptians, Palestinians and Jordanians) who were grouped and referred to as "West Eurasian" and appear in close proximity to the rest of the Eurasians. The study acknowledges that different 'Arab' groups differ from one another. The genetic and epigenetic lineage of the people of the Middle East puts the carriers varying Y-DNA haplogroups, including J1, into a migrating blend of ethnicities that have entered, gone through, mixed into, left, and returned to the Middle East throughout the ages. None of that is new or shocking, nor does any of it go against what I'm pointing out. That the indigenous Arab populations of the Middle East are descendants of the first Eurasian populations established after the hypothetical 'Out of Africa' migration doesn't change or establish new facts that those populations are descendants of the earliest Y-chromosome haplogroups (this was already pointed out in the emergence of J1 and J2 out of the parental GHIJK macro-haplogroup). Arabs in the Middle East correlate in large part with J1, and J1 is a direct descendant of GHIJK, which descended from F, which descended from CF. That doesn't in any way indicate that anyone referred to as 'Arab' shares that exact same maternal and paternal heritage in the same form and with the same mutations and divergence across the complete genome. You've bit your own lip trying to snap back and nay-say that 'Arabs' aren't a genetically distinct group of people that can all be identified with a singular Y-DNA haplogroup, and you even started out admitting to that, only to have your attempted argument regress and deteriorate into a mess of fallacies and empty assertions that contradict your original stance in order to make some poetic self-serving point woven out of \textbf{nothing}. You also need to learn to read and interpret properly, because the two-part claim isn't causational or consequential of one relating to the other; it states that (1) "these results place indigenous Arabs as the most distant relatives of all other contemporary non-Africans" and that (2) "[they] identify these people as direct descendants of the first Eurasian populations established by the out-of-Africa migrations". The former isn't "because of" the latter. Those two facts are already generally known (albeit with some variance) separately, and neither of them are posited to serve as disproof of the Y-DNA paternal lineage and migration of developed descendents of IJ deep into the Middle East prior to the evolution of proto-Semitic language and culture into more distinctly 'Arab' variations thereof (starting likely with the Nabataeans). ...\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Common, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}2/1271 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.157 \\  \hline

Now all we've got is "we're the most unique, we're the most distinct, we're the most authentic in West Asia and one of the most authentic, unique and distinct in the world", which, by the way, isn't even close to being mildly supported with even the most basic and conjectural hear-say, let alone evidence, reasoning, rationalizations, or even a claim to back up your self-contradiction regarding 'Arabs' being 'distinct' when you'd at least tacitly and implicitly admitted earlier on that Arabs aren't even all the same people, unless you now suddenly think that the Lebanese, Algerians, Northern Sudanese, Palestinians, Egyptians, Bahrainis, Iraqis, Libyans, Syrians Bedouins are all exactly the same "Arab" people who share more than just the same basic language and culture, enough so that they're all part of "the most distinct population in the world"...! Looks like that pride is blinding you a bit there, bud. "The figures are in the study. Figure showing Neanderthal ancestry and the autosomal analysis are the most interesting.

Your mere \textbf{blind} referral to "the claims in the study" show complacence and lack of attention on your part. Why would the figure showing Neanderthal ancestry and the autosomal analysis be the most interesting?! Do you even know what you're claiming or pointing out?! Let's go over it, shall we?! "Similar to other Middle Eastern populations, the indigenous Arabs had higher levels of Neanderthal admixture compared to Africans but had lower levels than Europeans and Asians. These levels of Neanderthal admixture are consistent with an early divergence of Arab ancestors after the out-of-Africa bottleneck but before the major Neanderthal admixture events in Europe and other regions of Eurasia."  [LINK]  - OK, and how does that in any way provide some supposedly "interesting" data that might somehow back up the assertion that "J1 = Arab" or that it supposedly makes Arabs carrying "J1" the "some of the most distinct populations in the world"? As for autosomal genomic PSMC analysis: "We next analyzed the full complement of autosomal polymorphisms for signals of ancient bottlenecks by applying the pairwise sequential Markov coalescent (PSMC) (Fig. 3; Li and Durbin 2011). This analysis showed that the Q1 (Bedouin) and Q2 (Persian-South Asian) had clear hallmarks of a bottleneck event, with effective population size hitting a trough in the range of 100,000 to 30,000 yr ago with a minimum at ‚àº60,000 yr ago. This same pattern is observed for a European individual from the 1000 Genomes Project and is consistent with what has been observed in other non-\textbf{African} human genomes using the pairwise sequential Markov coalescent, as well as related methods (Gronau et al. 2011; Fu et al. 2014; Schiffels and Durbin 2014). These data, therefore, point to the ancestors of Q1 (Bedouin) and Q2 (Persian-South Asian) as having migrated out of Africa at the same time as the ancestors of other non-\textbf{African} populations (Henn et al. 2012). Although PSMC estimates in the more recent past tend to have larger confidence intervals (Li and Durbin 2011), the Q1 (Bedouin) do appear to have a lower population size than the Q2 (Persian-South Asian) in the region <30,000 yr ago, consistent with high levels of inbreeding in the Q1 (Bedouin) (Hunter-Zinck et al. 2010; Sandridge et al. 2010; Mezzavilla et al. 2015). For the Q3 (\textbf{African}), the median effective population size was more similar to an \textbf{African} individual from the 1000 Genomes Project in the range 100,000 to 30,000 yr ago, consistent with Sub-Saharan \textbf{African} ancestry that is relatively recent (Omberg et al. 2012)." Yes, interesting in that it shows the population events and peaks with regards to the time periods and their occurrence in that region, but how does that change anything with regards to what we're discussing? In fact, why don't you start with telling me how this turned into a debate about how "distinct" the populations of the original ancestral Arabs of the Middle East are and how any of that distinction (true, exaggerated, or even outright false) - even if it was magically supported by matching autosomal, mitochondrial, neanderthal admixture, epigenetic, linguistic, cultural, anthropological and migrational evidence and other factors amongst all and ONLY Arab populations the world over - would have any bearing on Y-DNA haplogroup association with \textbf{ethnic} populations that aren't distinct owners of a singular shared originating haplogroup?

Regional studies also differ from individuals selected to represent the diverse ethnogenetic landscape of Iran, but it goes without saying that the majority of Iran's populations living in the most populace cities, including Tehran, Mashhad, Karaj, Qom, and Tabriz, show higher frequencies of the subclades of R1a - and in some cases R1b - than J2, though not by a significant enough percentile difference for the whole population.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}African, Common, Ethnic, Indian & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Ethnicity - Native-American, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}9/469 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.919 \\  \hline

This must be the 3rd time I've mentioned R1a and had you respond to me implying that you're quoting "R1a1a" in what I wrote. R1a and its subclades aren't limited to R1a1a. I never said the diversification of R1a1a "did occur in Iran" - I said the diversification of R1a is postulated (and sure, many would disagree either way) to have occurred in the region of Northwestern Iran and the Caucasus. Also, many even postulate that your consistently and insistently referenced R1a1a diversified and spread out of Iran. Most geneticists don't place the diversification region for R1a in India even when they don't place it in Iran. India is commonly thought to be a downstream recipient of R1a subclades through southward and south-eastern migration, in part from places that later on understandably belonged to the North Eastern corridor of the Persian empire. As for your assumption that the "shorter and closer" migration path is the likely one, that's not even close to being scientific. It's not as though the migration had a chosen destination and a map to follow. The paths of R1 migration in general is never seen as a direct and shortest-distance journey from one geographical region to another over a singular event. That's also the case for many other Y-chromosome migrations. That some central Asians have higher percentages of R1a1a speaks to their reception of continued influx of R1a subclades from both the Eurasian steppe as well as the near East, Persian and Anatolian regions. The culture and language that developed also spread into India from the North and North West following the same paths of migration and diversification. As for the birthplace of the haplogroup, it's not known whether R1a was born in Iran or any other place, but the place of diversification of R1a is often thought to be in or near present-day Iran, so wherever you're getting your claim of Iran definitely not being the birthplace of that haplogroup sound unreliable at best. As for "according to whom", that's according to multiple sources that debate the geographic area of diversification for the subclades of R1a. I can dig them up again if it really means so much to you for whatever reason, but something tells me you're just going to go back to quoting R1a1a while responding to what I'm saying. Never mind that none of this even related to what was being discussed in the first place. Also, you're repeating your claims with specific reference to R1a1a yet again, and it's becoming tiresome. I'm not even going to get into which subclades of what haplogroup appear in Iran because the original point has been completely side-stepped and the conversation is evolving into some chest-beating competition for ownership of unique, original and frequent R1a1a as though it establishes something significant. I'm nearly past the point of caring.  [LINK]  [LINK]  [LINK]  [LINK] "Iran is generally connected to the Elamite civilization which was very close to the Middle East and also close to the caucasus which is why they share similar Y markers like J2."You're pretty much making up whatever you want now. Iran isn't "generally connected to the Elamite civilization" at all. The Persians, specifically, took mainly cultural influences from the Elamites which they blended with the Indo-Iranian culture and customs they brought into the Persian plateau with them, shared with the Medians, Scythians and other ancient Iranic people migrating around Central Asia and the Caspian. Elamites themselves are thought to have been Dravidian in origin, and their genetic markers aren't identified as simply being 'J2' - it's thought that that the proto-Elamo-Dravidians carried J2, J1, L and trace amounts of H - the Elamites themselves were mixed with ancient Middle Eastern and near-Eastern descendants of GHIJK, and their populations were minuscule in Iran. There's also the nagging and inconvenient fact that the population of Elam, already relatively small by the time the Indo-Iranians started to appear in the region in successive expansions, declined even further with the dominance of the emerging Medians (not to mention that the Elamites were already under heavy influence by the Medians for more than 500 years well into the neo-Elamite period) and subsequent conversion of the empire into Persian - the Elamites also failed to mix into the population of the emerging Persian empire in significant proportion, much of which is thought to be matrilineal heritage, and generally limited to smaller populations in the south of Iran, which also coincides with the patrilineal dominance and elitist mixing habits of the Persians who supplanted the Y-DNA pool of the populations they overtook. The appearance of J2 in Iranian populations is largely linked to Middle Eastern, Levantine, Anatolian, Mediterranean and specific Western Zagros (Assyrian, et al.) populations that provided that admixture primarily in parts of Western Iran. "Y markers only show the migration path your early ancestors took and where they were originally living, that's all. Not always does it match Autosomal DNA since not every person carrying a similar halpogroup will have the same admixture. That's why Yemeni's despite being high in J1, will have much more \textbf{African} admixture compared to a Saudi or a Levantine with the same Haplogroup."Y markers aren't specifically or only limited to showing your "early ancestors" - they're used to draw a patrilineal ancestral tree going back one generation or several. It also doesn't necessarily show where your ancestors were living - depends on which ancestor at what point in your history you're looking to identify, and even then you'd have to know where that ancestral group actually resided. The rest is supplemental to and in agreement with what I'm saying anyway, except that the Yemeni population's autosomal and matrilineal genetics don't necessarily match those of Africans at the same rate as their Y-chromosomal relationship. The Yemeni also have a higher admixture of J1 than their cousins and neighbours in general, not merely because their neighbouring J1 are mixed, but also because they've received a returning admixture of \textbf{African} J1 where their neighbours have mixed instead with other Middle Eastern populations. Your response doesn't negate what you quoted either - I'll quote myself: "I never said haplogroups (even if you were to consider both mitochondrial and Y-chromosomal DNA) tell the 'entire story' of genetic ancestry, but paternal haplogroups do reveal a major part of the paternal ancestry of the population that also often matches the autosomal" - that doesn't say or imply that Y-chromosomes have to match autosomal DNA just because they often do in known short-ancestral lineage. Autosomal DNA proportional percentages vary and in a population like the Yemeni who have a singular and more uniform occurrence of Y-chromosomes at high frequency, it becomes easier to rely on the matches verifying shared paternal ancestry across the whole group shared with their neighbouring relatives through Y-chromosomes - either way, atDNA becomes more difficult to map the further down the hypothetical ethnolineal tree one might look for ancestors anyway, so the point is moot. We were speaking of Y-DNA, you said "we're 'too fixated' on Haplogroups" (which I wasn't, nor was I trying to use them to make a more vague and far-reaching point like certain others here have done) and you specified that "they only tell one part of your ancestry but not all of it", which is, again, not something I "denied" or implied to be "invalid".\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}African & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!27}2/1486 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.135 \\  \hline

Pan-Turk-supremacists want to tell everyone that they are the centre of the civilized world and where everything else descended out of or stole from, pan-Indian-supremacists want to tell everyone that India is that point of origin and hotbed of superior original accomplishments, pan-Arab-supremacists want the same thing for themselves with their own identity, as do the pan-Slavs, pan-Anglo-supremacists, the pan-African-/black-supremacists. It's just unfortunate that some of the poorer, lesser developed, most divided and conflict-stricken regions of the planet (many of them in Asia, the Middle East, South-Eastern Europe and Africa) always inspire people within them dealing with socioeconomic issues as distinct \textbf{ethnic} nations and sociocultural groups to express their insecurities and put the psychological backfire effect on display. Most honestly don't seem to wants to explore where we came from and accept that we had no control over it - instead most wish to beat each other over the head and signal their self-professed points of superiority to cover their insecurities. It's ridiculous, and yet we wonder why we're held back as a species. I'd much rather share what's unique and interesting about every culture everywhere and learn as much as there is, sample their foods, listen to their music, meet their people and understand what makes them who they are. Beyond that, if the facts about our past with regards to "who accomplished what " and "why" aren't explored in the interest of learning and improving all of us, then it's all toxic.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small +Nariman M You write way to much paragraphs, but hardly anything you said is close to true, they are just your own fantasies, i doubt you have any idea what your saying at all yourself but write huge chunks of writing to look smart. R1a evolved into different branches such as R1a1a-M17 and R1a1a M58, z32 and so forth. What exactly do you mean R1a? There is many branches of that, be more specific. You keep posting the same thing, 4 of your sources mention R1a1a coming from Iran and use Underhill's study. Why can't you post something other than Underhill that proves your notion of R1a coming from Iran? Seriously, do you just casually and habitually read whatever you want into whatever is convenient, or are you trying very hard to construct a straw man argument? This must be the 3rd time I've mentioned R1a and had you respond to me implying that you're quoting "R1a1a" in what I wrote. R1a and its subclades aren't limited to R1a1a. I never said the diversification of R1a1a "did occur in Iran" - I said the diversification of R1a is postulated (and sure, many would disagree either way) to have occurred in the region of Northwestern Iran and the Caucasus. Also, many even postulate that your consistently and insistently referenced R1a1a diversified and spread out of Iran. Most geneticists don't place the diversification region for R1a in India even when they don't place it in Iran. India is commonly thought to be a downstream recipient of R1a subclades through southward and south-eastern migration, in part from places that later on understandably belonged to the North Eastern corridor of the Persian empire. As for your assumption that the "shorter and closer" migration path is the likely one, that's not even close to being scientific. It's not as though the migration had a chosen destination and a map to follow. The paths of R1 migration in general is never seen as a direct and shortest-distance journey from one geographical region to another over a singular event. That's also the case for many other Y-chromosome migrations. That some central Asians have higher percentages of R1a1a speaks to their reception of continued influx of R1a subclades from both the Eurasian steppe as well as the near East, Persian and Anatolian regions. The culture and language that developed also spread into India from the North and North West following the same paths of migration and diversification. As for the birthplace of the haplogroup, it's not known whether R1a was born in Iran or any other place, but the place of diversification of R1a is often thought to be in or near present-day Iran, so wherever you're getting your claim of Iran definitely not being the birthplace of that haplogroup sound unreliable at best. As for "according to whom", that's according to multiple sources that debate the geographic area of diversification for the subclades of R1a. I can dig them up again if it really means so much to you for whatever reason, but something tells me you're just going to go back to quoting R1a1a while responding to what I'm saying. Never mind that none of this even related to what was being discussed in the first place.Like i said, the only source you have to back up what your saying is a study from Underhill conducted in 2012 and that itself is very weak since most geneticists disagree with Iran being the origin of the Halpogroup. India is a much more plausible place since the R1a1a and its sublcades found there is diverse, i don't agree with it either, but it sounds much more believable than some place like Iran which has generally been connected to the Middle East. What your saying is totally laughable at the best, do you know where southwards is? That's basically Nepal, Afghanistan and Central Asia, your basically saying those sublcades came from there. How is my theory not scientific? It makes much more sense then what you are saying, granted its my own opinion but the Andronovo and Sinsastha cultures were brought by Aryans and the remnants of individuals of those cultures showed they were mainly R1a1a, which means it came from Aryans of the steppes where R1a1a is mainly believed to have originated from.You're pretty much making up whatever you want now. Iran isn't "generally connected to the Elamite civilization" at all. The Persians, specifically, took mainly cultural influences from the Elamites which they blended with the Indo-Iranian culture and customs they brought into the Persian plateau with them, shared with the Medians, Scythians and other ancient Iranic people migrating around Central Asia and the Caspian. Elamites themselves are thought to have been Dravidian in origin, and their genetic markers aren't identified as simply being 'J2' - it's thought that that the proto-Elamo-Dravidians carried J2, J1, L and trace amounts of H - the Elamites themselves were mixed with ancient Middle Eastern and near-Eastern descendants of GHIJK, and their populations were minuscule in Iran.

The appearance of J2 in Iranian populations is largely linked to Middle Eastern, Levantine, Anatolian, Mediterranean and specific Western Zagros (Assyrian, et al.) populations that provided that admixture primarily in parts of Western IranYes it is, the Elamites couldn't have just disappeared out of Iran without a trace, they had to leave descendants behind. Persians are their descendants because they were from the same area and like you said J2 was a \textbf{common} marker among Elamites which is also \textbf{common} among Persians. Indo-Iranians didn't replace the population of Iran just like they didn't with Northern India or Europe. They just brought over their languages and their languages gradually replaced native ones. So who are those populations that brought over J2 to Iran then? Its most likely neothilic since Iran has been generally historically connected to the Middle East and the Caucasus. Honestly this is what i said as well, your basically agreeing with me.Y markers aren't specifically or only limited to showing your "early ancestors" - they're used to draw a patrilineal ancestral tree going back one generation or several. It also doesn't necessarily show where your ancestors were living - depends on which ancestor at what point in your history you're looking to identify, and even then you'd have to know where that ancestral group actually resided.

Of course Autosomal won't match with Y markers since say a Norwegian carrying R1a1a will have a much more different autosomal admixture then say an Afghan with R1a1a. The rest of what you said is irrelevant and unimportant. Anyways here is a map of R1a1a frequency around the world, if you scroll down, out of 150 samples,  it doesn't peak more than 12 in all of Iran, much lower than 15 as expected.

Yes but as far as the moors go. I have not been able to fine much on them and scientists really haven't done much research on the moors. Have a look on the internet a little bit. I have read long stories of Sicilians having a DNA test and many having at lest 14 to 30 of Arab blood and many other backgrounds as well. Are Arabs white ? Not what we see as being white is in the world today and as long as I live. No matter what anyone says, they will never be white as a people. Next someone will say blacks are Native American because some do have Blood in them or white because the white slave owners rape many of them during slavery and they now muts. I go by what you have most in your blood and less of what a person looks like in many cases.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small SPizzle, I live among many Italians, have had Italian friends, girls, landlords and co-workers most of my life, and know many people who've been to Italy, all of whom report seeing the same thing I've seen. Italians on average are NOT as white as other European countries. On average they resemble Spaniards, Portuguese, Persians, Greeks, Turks, Lebanese, Georgians, Armenians and other similar-complexioned Caucasians. Northern Italians are different and are generally lighter because they're mixed with Germanic and Celtic people throughout the ages. I've also met Italians who are as dark as Indians and Peninsula Arabs.Non-Europeans might think Italians are "Arabs" for whatever reason they wish, but "Arab" is a linguistic term more than anything, and many Arabs are in fact ethnically more closely related to Italians and other ethnogenetic Indo-Europeans and their cousins. The stereotype about Italians is still largely accurate because they do have slightly darker complexion and a much higher frequency of dark brown and \textbf{black} hair as well as brown/hazel/green eyes. No one of sound mind assumes that any Caucasian/Caucasoid country is "non-white" because we understand what "white" entails, and that, more than anything, from a certain region onward towards North-Western Europe, we have a mixture of the descendants of different ancient Caucasoids who've adapted to different weather conditions.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Well no, I never said Italians aren't white. Of course they're white - all tanned or darker Caucasians are still white, and that even goes for people who are noticeably darker than Italians. We have to separate the traditional and incorrect meaning of "white" from what it truly means, because the traditional social norm dictated that only those with pale white skin, blue/grey eyes and \textbf{r\textbf{ed}}, blonde, or light brown hair, and noticeably Burro-Blatic/Germanic/Norse/Celtic/etc. are "white", which is obviously not the case at all. Also, regarding Italians, I've had this conversations with and about Italians many times. None of the people I'm referring to are Sicilians. In fact, at least three of them are from Northern Italy, and most people know that from the middle of Italy upwards towards the North, the genetics of the population contain much more in the way of European admixtures from Germanic and Celtic. Most mainland Italians are still Brunettes who have noticeably darker complexion than Central, Eastern, Western Northern, North-Eastern, and North-Western Europeans. In fact, even many people from the Balkans (namely Serbians) are typically lighter in complexion than many Italians. Their stereotype is apparent if you look at their soccer players, media personalities, actors and actresses, and other average typical Italians. They have the "Mediterranean" overall complexion through half of their population, and the rest are Northern, reside in the mountains, and/or have mixed ancestry. The same goes for Greeks. Their genetics also in-part account for this, so it's not (shouldn't be) much of a surprise.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small A lot of things are wrong with this video.  First, "Arab" is a broad term.  Levantine Arabs are often "white" and usually indistinguishable from Southern Europeans.  So if Sicilians, Greeks, Cypriots, and Portuguese are "white," then most "Arabs" from Syria, Lebanon, and Israel/Palestine are "white."  And many have extremely light features, like blonde hair and/or blue eyes, so they look even "whiter" than many Europeans.  The same is somewhat true, though maybe to a lesser extent, for North \textbf{African} Arabs. Also, the 19th century is when most Jews came to the US and they faced as much discrimination as any Arabs (if not more), often being barred from neighborhoods, restaurants, clubs, and professions.  They came from Europe (geographically) but were not considered "white" by most Americans.Arabs from Arabia, especially southern Arabia, might be harder to pin down, but if you want to go by whatever scientific basis there is for "\textbf{race}," then they are also Caucasian and thus "white," even if many look much darker.Also, Arab-Americans can come from Israel, too, which you (not surprisingly) left off the list or replaced with "Palestine" (which is a geographic term and a theoretical state, but not a country--and even if it was then Arabs can still be from Israel itself).If Jews and Mediterranean Europeans are considered "white" then many, if not most, Arab-Americans are absolutely "white."\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}African, Race & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/227 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.881 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small There are no "pure Arabs," and "Arabs" from the Levant are completely different from those in Arabia or Mesopotamia.  Different history, different culture, different genetic makeup.  "Semitic people" is also not an \textbf{ethnic} or racial group, it's a linguistic term that refers to a wide variety of \textbf{ethnic} groups, some of whom share much more in \textbf{common} with Indo-European groups (genetically and culturally) than other Semitic people.  There's also a very clear difference between northern Semitic people (who inhabited the Levant and Mesopotamia before the spread of Islam) and southern Semitic people (who originate in the Arabian peninsula).That being said, Eurasian and North \textbf{African} people who are olive-skinned are "white" by virtually any scientific classification, which is my point.

Also, many European peoples (like Greeks and Sicilians) have olive-colored skin, while many Levantine/Anatolian peoples have white skin.  I think it's also really important to note that much of Southern and Central European ancestry came from West Asia when agriculture spread. Recent studies have actually indicated that many pre-agricultural Europeans had darker skin, and that lighter skin partly originated in West Asia.  In any case, my point was that "whiteness" and Europe are in no sense mutually dependent.That being said, Semitic is not a racial term, it's linguistic.  (Ethiopians and Assyrians are both Semitic, yet Armenians are not despite being closely-related to Assyrians.)

Many of us have almond-shaped eyes, wider noses, thicker and often curlier hair, and fuller lips. Same with Hispanics. Many of the olive-skinned Latinos have skin tones similar to Sicilians, but their Mestizo/Native American features (Asiatic eyes, full lips, curlier hair, etc.) are usually distinguishing factors as far as non-white classification goes. There are plenty of Native Americans and Hispanics with fair skin, yet they get the benefits of minority status. Yet, ironically, it's fair to say that Middle Eastern people are closing in on \textbf{black} people as the most hated \textbf{race} in the U.S....yet the government wants to label us white?!

They were not European.  Some of them had white skin, some \textbf{y\textbf{e\textbf{llow}}} skin, some \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} skin, and some light brown skin.  But aside from some admixture with Greeks and Romans, they were West Asian.  White skin is not exclusive to Europe and it actually partly originated in Western Asia.Arabs mostly pioneered the \textbf{black} \textbf{African} slave trade, and there were huge populations of \textbf{black} Africans in the Arab world, especially along the coast (such as in Kuwait).And while Yemeni and Saudi are certainly closer to "real" Arabs (seeing as they are indigenous to the Arabian Peninsula, which is the home to the Arabic language), there was mixture with Levantine populations in certain areas and East Africans in other areas (like Yemen of course), leading to some having darker and some much lighter skin.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}African, Black, Red, Yellow & \cellcolor{green!27} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Ethnicity - Asian (East- China, Japan, Korea, Philippines, Vietnam), Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - Native-American, Nationality - Chinese, Nationality - Japanese & \cellcolor{green!27}8/165 & \cellcolor{green!27}4.848 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The Amhara people of Ethiopia speak a unique and indigenous Semitic language, and have been speaking it for thousands of years.  No "Semitic" peoples are today are "pure" in any sense of the word, neither linguistically nor genetically.  Modern Iraqi and Syrian Muslims have significant ancestry from the Arabian Peninsula, which mostly arrived after the introduction of Islam.  So I'm not sure why the people who retained their pre-Muslim Assyrian identity (even if they were already genetically mixed) than groups that later mixed with \textbf{migrant} populations.Moroccans are completely different from Iraqis genetically and culturally.  Iraqis are genetically much more closely related to Persians than they are to Moroccans.Your description of "Asian" refers to East Asians, who are completely different from West Asians.  South Asians (Indians) are also completely different from East Asians, so I'm not sure what your point is.  Arabian plate is largely irrelevant since there is desert separating the Eastern Mediterranean coast from the Arabian Peninsula, and the Levant is closer to Southeastern Europe and is at the end of a continuous green patch that extends from Anatolia down to the Sinai Desert.You're right that Europe is essentially a fictional continent, but you're also conflating geological features with human society and migrations.  These geological distinctions and movement occur over massive periods of time and have little to do with human populations.  Are you suggesting that Europeans and East Asians are closely related because they're both on the Eurasian Plate?You find "Semitic" ancestry throughout Central and Southern Europe in varying degrees, including places like Germany.  So the only remotely "pure" Europeans would be Scandinavians.  Also, Jivan, many groups that are considered "white" by some mainstream Americas, like Ashkenazi Jews, do not consider themselves to be white, even if they can pass as white, like many Levantine Arabs.  You keep referring to the fact that you're the most hated group in America, yet victims of the most religiously-motivated hate crimes in the country are Jews.  Many Hispanic people are "white," but Native Americans are almost certainly not.  Generally speaking, "white" Hispanic people are predominately descended from Spaniards, though many, again, look about as European as Levantine Arabs.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Migrant & \cellcolor{green!5}Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/361 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.277 \\  \hline

It's not \textbf{black} and white (no pun intended), and this was my point from the beginning.  There are many populations that you might consider "white," who do not consider themselves to be "white" and vice versa.  There's no hard division between Europe and Western Asia (or Mesopotamia, the Levant, Persia, Anatolia, and the southern Caucuses), and they are all variations of mixed ancestries that overlap tremendously. The same is true of North Africans. Remove the context, and your sister could easily pass as a "white" child.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Yes, many do.  Ashkenazim are sometimes (though not always) pale, true, but so are many Palestinians, especially women who don't get enough sunlight.  I've met tons of Lebanese, Palestinian, and Syrian-Americans who look exactly like Southern Europeans, both in terms of coloration and physical features.  Hell, many look Central European.  "European" noses, mouths, and eyes.  And while, yes, the proportion of Ashkenazim and Europeans with lighter features is higher than those of Levantine Arabs (as well as more "European" features), it's all on a gradient.  There's no line.  There are many Italians from the peninsula, especially southern Italy, who have similar features to Levantine Arabs.  I never said that being olive-skinned is the defining characteristic of looking Middle Eastern, but considering that the term "white" inherently implies skin tone, then "white" people with brownish skin is pretty contradictory, especially since 2 of the 3 genes associated with "whiteness" came to Europe via Anatolia with agriculture.  And since many \textbf{ethnic} groups from all over Asia that were never in Europe (from Iran, Afghanistan, Georgia, and other places) look as "white" as any Europeans--in terms of facial features, hair color, eye color, and skin tone--it's a very messy distinction.Things like facial structure and features also vary tremendously among both "Arab" and "European" populations, and there's hardly a single type that unites all of either group.  Scandinavians look \textbf{nothing} like Italians or Spaniards.  Yemenis look \textbf{nothing} like Lebanese.Again, my entire point is that these populations form a continuum with tons of overlap, and trying to put a hard line anywhere is extremely subjective.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnic, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/262 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.145 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Simeon BK "White" does NOT inherently imply skin tone. It implies you're of European descent from a racial standpoint, and that your phenotype/features are native to Europe. Just as "\textbf{black}" doesn't mean you have \textbf{black} skin, it means your ancestry is \textbf{African}. What you're doing is taking the smallest of small minorities of Middle Eastern people---those with pale skin, light hair/eyes (less than 10 of us) and comparing them to what the majority of European people look like (90 or so) as a means to suggest we are one in the same. Do you have any idea how moronic that is?

She is often mistaken for every imaginable \textbf{ethnicity}, from Spanish to Italian to Egyptian to Pakistani.  I never said "all," I said many.  Again, it's a gradient. You're drawing hard lines where there are none.  And that's exactly my point.  Many (not all) of the people whose pictures you posted hardly look different from many southern Europeans, especially those from Italy and Greece.  Some could even pass in the Balkans.And a lot of features--as you've pointed out--like darker skin are heavily influenced by climate.  For example, my girlfriend was quite dark in Syria.  She's lived in the US for about 4 years and her skin is whiter than mine.  And I also get dark easily when I go to the Mediterranean, and pale in colder climates.Again, I never said these populations are identical, I said there are no hard divisions.

This might not be the majority, but it's certainly not an insignificant minority (probably like 1/3).  And really, either way, some groups (like Jews for instance) also face specific non-"white" scrutiny/treatment--regardless of appearance---even if it's different from what you are currently experiencing.  And Jews are a group who, for the most part, are today considered "white," even if we weren't 50 years ago.  My entire point was that this is a very muddy gray area and, regardless of how you self-identify, it's not a place where hard divisions make sense.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small laila, I am well aware that light features are not exclusive to Europe, but generally the association is made based on people's appearance.  "Whiteness" is not an exclusively-European trait (which is what I've been saying all along) yet people automatically make that assumption.  And that's kinda my point...  That being "white" does not make someone European, and being European does not make someone "white."  For instance, an African-American is almost always physically distinguishable from a European-American (unless there's a lot of hair/skin tone manipulation).  The same is true of East Asian-Americans.  So it makes sense that if you're going to have a "racial" classification in the census, that these are distinctly separate groups.  But with Hispanic-Americans, things get murky because some people are Native American, some are European-American, and most are some mixed variation, which is why it's classified as an "\textbf{ethnicity}" rather than a "\textbf{race}."  If anything, I can see "Arab" being added as that, but it's not a "\textbf{race}."  Honestly, I think that South Asians probably need their own "\textbf{race}" classification more than anyone since right now they generally put "Asian," which makes no sense since they're not at all related to East Asians.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Morgan Webber I never said you had to be blond-haired and blue-eyed to be European/white. I said you had to be European to be white because that's whom the term was originally designed for. And yes, Southern Europeans look more like us than they do Swedes and that's because they have some of our DNA, as well as some \textbf{African} admixture. Such doesn't apply to northern Italians, but the Maltese and Sicilians have \textbf{African} and Middle Eastern admixture, same with Anatolian Greeks. And as far as the "Caucasian" argument goes and its application to Middle Easterners, I feel such is not relevant in today's day and \textbf{age}. The entire concept of the "Caucasian" \textbf{race} was created by a moronic \textbf{Nazi} anthropologist who had biased pretenses. He used pseudoscientific concepts to develop his racial ideologies. Not only did he claim that Middle Easterners and North Africans belonged to the same \textbf{race} as Europeans like Nordics, for instance (which is moronic in its own right), but he also claimed that Indians belonged to such a \textbf{race} as well. Let's take a moment to realize how incredibly asinine it sounds to suggest that Anglos and Punjabis should somehow belong to the same \textbf{race}. It's total nonsense. And I do not subscribe to pseudoscience, which is why I refrain from referring to anyone as "Caucasian", with the exception of those who actually descend from the Caucuses, like Circassians, Georgians, Chechens, etc. They are Caucasians. \textbf{Nobody} else is. And as far as the European/White argument goes, I only consider Europeans to be white and \textbf{nobody} else because that's whom the term was originally designated for. The usage of "white" as a racial classification was created by people of European ancestry to describe themselves. So there is no "white" \textbf{race}, just peoples of European descent who labelled themselves "white". And if Middle Easterners aren't European, then, by definition, we aren't white.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small So you will disregard Caucasian as a broad term for whites and Indians (in which you're right, as it actually belongs to Caucasus peoples - Armenians, Georgians, etc), but yet you will use "white" only for Europeans? That's also a rather superficial view, because, newsflash, Europe is NOT a \textbf{race}. You don't suddenly change races as you step out, or in, of Europe. Are white, blonde Russians outside of European Russia non-whites because they're not in Europe, despite their white features? This logic is just baseless.Do you realize that Europe is not even a real continent? It's a political one. The actual, physical continent is Eurasia, which involves Europe and Asia. So by that logic, shouldn't Asians and whites be of the same \textbf{race}? Of course not. Europe was a pick-and-choose type of continent. Heck, if Lebanon, Turkey and Israel were 99 Christian nations, they would've been considered to be part of the EU. And if Malta were an Islamic country, you guessed it, it would've been considered to be part of North Africa or Western Asia. Simply put, they would've been a Middle Eastern country.Maltese and Lebanese people usually resemble each other, and cluster close genetically. But because one happens to be politically part of Europe, they'll be automatically "white" to you? How does that make sense? Science and biology obviously disagrees with this notion. Btw, Malta is actually in the \textbf{African} plate. It's only Europeanized because its inhabitants are Christian and they're part of the EU. Yes, Middle Easterners are NOT European, as Europe is a region, not a \textbf{race}. Europe doesn't own the white \textbf{race}, despite the fact that most whites come from there. But some Middle Easterners will be white and share features with Southern Europeans and even Slavs. Bringing up east Asian and native Americans is a false equivalence as they do NOT have Caucasian features, and are from the other side of the world. And you know what's a \textbf{racist}, \textbf{Nazi} way of seeing \textbf{race}? Saying that ONLY Europeans are of the white \textbf{race}. I swear, that's something a white supremacist would say. Heck, David Duke and Jared Taylor have uttered such things. They believe, Europe = White. Don't feed into their agenda. P.S. Some Europeans, especially southerners are not just olive skinned, but almost light brown.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Morgan Webber Okay, let me break it down for you so maybe you'll understand my point better. Firstly, I don't use "white" to describe all Europeans...Really, only for Anglos/Nordics/Celts, etc. Ya know, the "white" looking ones. For instance, I don't call Italians white, I just call them Italian, or European if the context calls for it. Same for most "\textbf{ethnic}-looking" Europeans, like Greeks, Romanians, etc. I never refer to them as whites. But, it is fact that the term "white" as a racial designation was created by Europeans to describe themselves. Don't blame that on me. Secondly, the reason I included Natives in my white phenotypic argument was because some of are thought of as "white" to those who are racially ignorant. There are plenty of Natives who have fair skin/hair and lighter eyes, and are believed to be white by ignorant people because their skin isn't dark brown. On top of that, I know plenty of blacks from urban areas who think of dark-skinned Latinos like Dominicans as whites. Truth be told, there are a lot of people in the world who think \textbf{race} and skin color are the same thing, so, in their minds, if you don't have dark brown/black skin or Asiatic eyes, you must be white/European, which is obviously not true. At the end of the day, the basis of this argument is not entirely on phenotype. My argument that Middle Easterners shouldn't be labelled as "white", "European" or whatever you wanna label the majority in this country is because of the way we're treated. You're looking at only phenotype as the criteria for my perspective, which is very close-minded because our culture is just as damaging to the way the West views us as our physical appearance is. As you said, there are many southern Europeans with darker skin and \textbf{ethnic} features. The difference is, when you hear darker-skinned Italians speaking Italian in public to each other, you don't think anything of it. But when you see someone who looks like me speaking Arabic to another person who looks like me, your ears perk up. Your thoughts are instantly stereotypical. And when the name "Antonio Romano" or "Vladimir Kapinski" shows up on a job application, an employer doesn't bat an eyelash. But when "Khalid Al-Abbas" or "Mohammad Abdullah" pops up, instant \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} flags are raised. And lastly, \textbf{nobody} views southern and eastern European cultures with a negative undertone in the 21st century, except for maybe the KKK or something. But the same cannot be said for Middle Easterners. We're antagonized for our religious beliefs if we're Muslim and the West often presents us as violent and deceiving peoples. \textbf{Nobody} labels a Russian \textbf{immigrant} as a potential \textbf{communist} spy, but everyone thinks a Syrian or Iraqi \textbf{immigrant} has to be tied to ISIS. THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE. Everything about our culture is viewed in a negative fashion by the majority population here in America. If you can't understand that, then I have \textbf{nothing} more to say to you. Comparing the Italian or Slavic-American experience to that of the Middle Eastern American experience is apples to oranges.

I even read a claim by you earlier in this thread that you're Armenian, Syrian and Kurd, and yet you're apparently somehow under the impression that you're "ethnically Semitic", which is a massively problematic statement in and of itself), but especially in your case. You're at best mixed-Indo-European, Western Asian, and still very much Caucasoid. The fact is, most Middle Eastern people are indeed 'white', because there's no such thing as "the white \textbf{race}" - there are only Caucasoids and those who are mixed with other races and sub-racial groups. None of the people and ethnicities you mentioned are considered to have been noticeably mixed with any racial groups other than other varying permutations of 'Caucasoids'. In other words, regardless of whether you choose to refer to it as Caucasoid or 'white', you're referring to a larger cohesive racial group that you're a part of one way or another. You also mentioned that most Europeans are "from the Middle East", which is largely NOT the case, and I'd urge you - for your own sake - to never make such a claim to anyone who has studied the history of Europe in depth.

Europeans are not the only people "considered white", and many Europeans of native-European and extra-European Caucasoid origins (even those living above and outside of traditionally-identified "Southern European" countries and regions) are in fact darker than many Middle Eastern people, and many are NOT of European descent or from partial European descent including the Turks, Cypriots, Italians, Ukrainians, Albanians, Croatians, Bulgarians, et. al. - the original definition is also seen to be misleading because it refers to a 'colour' of skin (complexion) that can't always reliably be used to even distinguish between different races, let alone different \textbf{ethnic}/sub-racial groups within those larger racial classifications. People of European descent are more accurately referred to as (surprise!) "European" and "Europid" and at times using more specific terms less often used based on context. As a whole, you don't refer to "Europeans" as "white" and all other people closely related to them as "something else". That's why scientific racial genomics and racial classifications based on haplogroups exist. "Middle Easterners are Asian, hence we are not whites."That's literally nonsensical. You're using a fallacious and incorrect statement as a false axiom around which you conveniently pivot another false statement supported by the original incorrect axiomatic assertion. I can't even call this cyclical logic, because there's almost no consistent logic therein. Middle Easterners are only geographically Asian, and ethnically/racially diverse at best while invariably and all-too-frequently falling under the Semitic and Indo-European Caucasoid classifications. Many Middle Easterners are also "white" by both complexion and phenotype as well as \textbf{ethnic} ancestry relating back to Europe, so either way you're embarrassingly wrong, albeit with differing degrees of comical and blatant obviousness depending on which definition you may selectively decide to abuse in order to inflate your pseudo-argument or distract from the inescapable fact that you've done \textbf{nothing} to disprove the counter-arguments you've faced or even substantiate your own confused musings.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnic, Mental, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}3/461 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.651 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small KoivuTheHab you've got it completely backwards, bro. Terms like "Indo-European" and "Aryan" have \textbf{nothing} to do with being white. Indo-European, per its definition, is a linguistic branch for languages of Europe AND Asia. Aryan, per its original meaning, was a self-designating term of nobility, deriving from the \textbf{Indian} subcontinent and eventually becoming employed by Persians and Armenians (both West Asian/Middle Eastern groups). And then you say that "geographical location is irrelevant, this is all about \textbf{ethnicity} and DNA". Well how do you think DNA is created? It's based on the climate/conditions of your ancestral land. And the DNA of Middle Easterners is significantly different from Europeans because of the climate, with a few exceptions being that of Sicilians, Maltese and Anatolian Greeks, who have comparable DNA to Middle Easterners. Why else do you think modern DNA tests categorize "Middle Eastern" and "European" separately? It's because we're different genetically.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity, Indian, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - General, Ethnicity - Native-American & \cellcolor{green!27}3/148 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.027 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Indo-European isn't merely a linguistic branch - in fact, it's far more concretely and uniformly recognized to be a sub-racial group comprising several closely related ethnicities, many of whom no longer necessarily speak Proto-Indo-European-descended languages. Also, Aryan doesn't derive "from the \textbf{Indian} subcontinent" - it was a self-designating term for the Indo-European tribes that migrated out of the Eurasian steppes. Some, like the Iranians, kept the name long enough to incorporate it into the name of their \textbf{nation}. Iran literally means land of the Aryans. It was adopted later on TO MEAN nobility (not vice versa) by the rest of the \textbf{Indian} subcontinent after the establishment of new political and social elite hierarchy led by the Aryans who had arrived there and settled from Northern-\textbf{Indian} southward. The Aryans, their lineage and their language are proven not to have originated in the \textbf{Indian} Subcontinent, but to have been a part of successful large-scale invasion of Aryans into the subcontinent. Also, the "DNA" (genetics) of many Middle Easterners happens to be very close to most Europeans IN SPITE OF the geographical differences between them (separating them by thousands of years in most cases). Also, modern genetic tests don't categorize Middle Eastern and European as two separate and mutually exclusive entities with clearly defined lines and distinguishing qualities or limits. It's incredibly difficult to make such broad, generic and simplistic classifications for the populations of many countries in both Europe and the Middle East (e.g. Turkey, Albania, Bulgaria, Russia, Georgia, Armenia, Iran, Azerbaijan, Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, Cyprus, Afghanistan, Bosnia Herzegovina, Moldova, et. al.). Jivan likes to spread the ideas that seem more attractive to him, regardless of how untrue and disproven they are, and then tells the people he disagrees with that they're got it backwards even though he's the one who has it all backwards.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small First of all, that's a logical fallacy. If you have to try to stretch your opposition's arguments to the most extreme ends to make a fallacious comparison, you're reaching and setting up a Straw Man just to prove a point that's vague and misleading. I never even mentioned the South-Asian \textbf{Indian} subcontinent Australoid-mixed Dravidian Indians being comparable to 'Anglos'. Secondly, even then you'd have to specify: which Indians and which Anglos? Northern Indians, including many Punjabis, are far more Caucasoid (they're genetically close to Iranians), and many Anglos are Celtic/proto-Slavic from their Welsh, Cornish, \textbf{Black} Irish and Franco-Iberian Gaul roots. For instance, genetic testing has shown that people in many parts of Northern India and Pakistan are surprisingly close in genetic relation to the Welsh. The Welsh, likewise, relate to ancient Indo-Iranic proto-Celtic tribes that relate closely to the Scythians (and ancient Iranic \textbf{ethnic} group). The most easily easily varying and commonly variable phenotypical differentiation factor (outward melanin-determined skin, hair and eye complexion) fools most of the uninitiated into assuming that the darker complexion of the Northern Indians makes them noticeably genetically different from the people of Europe, but the genetic difference between South-Indians and Northern Indians is greater than the genetic differences between Northern Indians and Eurasians/Middle-Easterners/Near-Easterners/North-Africans.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Ethnic, Indian & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Ethnicity - Native-American & \cellcolor{green!27}3/208 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.442 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I'm not going to stop bringing up something scientific just to make you feel better about what you WANT to believe in against all evidenced scientific substantiation and qualified reasoning. It's not "MY Caucasoid argument", and you can call it stupid all you want, but it's established beyond a sliver of doubt that Middle Eastern people are indeed Caucasoid. It's very convenient that you'd claim that "that well has run dry" when in reality you haven't done anything to disprove it or reason against it. It doesn't even have anything to do with Blumenbach's model, even though it's in fact not outdated and is still verified by existing genealogical models. His definitions needed to be reworded, which is why modern science supplements skull and bone structure analysis with actual genetic testing of DNA haplogroups. You can try to make a Straw Man argument all you want, but even your logically fallacious statement isn't proven true or valid, let alone the actual scientific evidence attained in the field of genetic research. You refer to modern science while ironically ignoring its findings and failing to acknowledge that the evidence it gives us regarding racial and \textbf{ethnic} profiles of varying people tells us that Northern Indians (Punjabis included) are Caucasoid. No one who has a developed and initiated understanding of \textbf{race} and genealogy cares why a Census Bureau may choose to categorize a people a certain way when the scientific evidence and findings stand against it. In this case, Indians are referred to as "Asian" only when it's not specified as "South Asian", and they're only ever mixed in with 'Asian' to denote geographic origins for the responding individuals and groups. They may have many other reasons - selective, specific, and up to date, or not - but those classifications are still broadly based on geographic \textbf{ethnic} identities, which are incorrect and highly inaccurate. Besides, many 'Asians' and 'South Asians' (people living in Asia and South Asia) are confirmed to be Caucasoid, so it's not as though the finding goes against the option being provided. Racial groups aren't sub-races/ethnicities. Punjabis are also closely related to Indo-Iranians from the migration of the Aryans into their homeland, and are related to other Western-Asian and actual Caucasus-region ethnicities, all of which are Caucasoid. As for the notion of a Middle Eastern  North \textbf{African} category being labelled separately from "whites", it goes without saying (again) that they try to avoid confusion by separating people into their geographical groupings. North Africans aren't 'Africans', but most people also have no clue that most of them are almost fully Caucasoid. Why do you think 'Jews' are labelled as 'Middle Eastern' regardless of their actual \textbf{ethnic} background? Why do you think Kazakhs, regardless of how white and almost entirely Slavic they may be, are listed and identified as Asian? Why do you think Turks are identified as either European or Middle Eastern arbitrarily? The census bureau findings are almost never scientific or meant to accurately portray or represent what people actually are. The point is to get people to report on what they are, where they're from, and what they identify their ethnicities as. People are largely ignorant of their own \textbf{ethnic} background and genetic make-up anyway, so why needlessly confuse them further by giving people the uncommon but scientifically and historically accurate options that they may fail to understand which can also lead them to answer incorrectly? The popular opinions of people seem to get the most consideration in designing such public census and survey regimen. Why are you so against being racially identified as what you are anyway? Your ethnicities would still be intact either way in this case (assuming your beliefs regarding what your genetic make-up and family history could be are accurate), so is this just a hate-fest against 'whites' and 'Europeans' on your part?\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African, Ethnic, Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}6/639 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.939 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Omar, there are also the Iraqi Christians who trace their lineage in part back to Babylon.

One particulr Iraqi man working in a convenience store in Vancouver even surprised me because he looked exactly like most Slavs and Baltic residents generally do, and while his wife looked more Turkish/Persian/Levantine, his two sons looked Ukrainian/Polish. Of course, the main point here is (and should be) that science and genetics recognize melanin-related phenotypical variations to be comparatively superficial and far too unreliable a variable to be used or seen as anything other than a record of how long the people in question have spent in hotter climates.

Persians and Turks do contain genes from the Caucasus and are hence in part Caucasians (of the Caucasus) by \textbf{ethnic} genetic grouping. But if Caucasian is meant to mean (represent) 'Caucasoid' then they are entirely 'Caucasian' in that respect, as are the large majority of other 'Caucasoids'.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Nariman M. You're delusional, dude. How the does wanting be identified by a more suitable title make me a \textbf{racist}? Please explain that to me, because I truly don't understand your logic in that sense. Also, I implore that you read the rest of my post prior to rushing to judgment. Let me begin by saying that you are not wrong about your anthropological analysis. You're right in that, technically speaking, Europeans, North Africans, and Middle Easterners all belong to the same \textbf{race} per scientific standards. You are absolutely correct in that sense. But what you fail to realize is that \textbf{race} on the Census has seldom been predicated on anthropological studies. It has rather been about more easily identifying socially-perceived minorities/nonwhites---which, in most cases, Middle Easterners and North Africans are perceived as---and classifying them accordingly. If such wasn't the case, then explain why modern \textbf{race} forms on the Census have an Hispanic/Latino category when \textbf{nothing} close to such existed on the original \textbf{race} model? Explain why Indians are labelled under the same category as East Asians when they were originally considered "Caucasoid" and East Asians as "Mongoloids"? Tell me why Natives, East Asians, and Pacific Islanders are each considered their own \textbf{race} on the Census today, when, per the original model, they were all categorized under one \textbf{race}? The examples I'm providing prove that \textbf{race} on the Census has little to do with science and more to do with social perception. Oh, and wasn't there a point when the Irish, despite being Western Europeans, were considered nonwhite? Furthermore, Middle Easterners were considered Asiatic prior to 1910. How can you explain such if the Census is supposed to be predicated solely on science as you seem to believe? You refuse to acknowledge that your anthropological studies have historically had little bearing on the Census, yet you continue to go back to that well as an attempt to justify Middle Easterners/North Africans not getting our own category. Simple logic would beg the question, if what was once labelled the "\textbf{Mongoloid}" \textbf{race} could be broken into three separate races ("Asian", "Native American", and "Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander"---four if you can't the "Hispanic/Latino" additive) on the Census for specified identification purposes, why can't the same be done with the "Caucasian" category? It could simply be split into "European-American" and "Middle Eastern/North \textbf{African}". Specified data on the Census makes understanding America's demographics easier for everybody, and most Americans, whether you want to believe it or not, view Middle Easterners and North Africans as racially different from whites/Europeans, regardless of what anthropology says. And \textbf{race} on the Census is mostly about social perception, so again, it makes the most sense for us to be identified separately from whites. I have \textbf{nothing} against whites/Europeans, I just don't like them trying to deny our right to a more suitable identity. They know good and well that America views us as racially separate from them, a prime example being the debate of "white terrorism" (i.e school shooters), which Liberals use to counter the notion that only when Middle Easterners commit mass killings can it be labelled an act of terrorism. Whites are well aware of this, yet many of them don't want us to get the protection that recognized minority groups are entitled to. Simply put, we're nonwhite when it comes to terrorism in this country but white when it comes to potentially receiving minority protection. What kind of sense does that make? If having this perspective makes me a \textbf{racist}, then I just have to believe you have little understanding as to what a \textbf{racist} truly is. Perhaps, you just have an agenda.

First of all, by that same logic, the Europeans who were wanting to be identified as "separate" from so many other Caucasoid people - despite their own science later proving them wrong - were by that same logic "not \textbf{racist}". Your entire claim regarding Europeans "not accepting you" is a reversal of you not "accepting" that they're closely related to you.

We're back to you basically ignoring everything you've been told up until now and repeating your previous points with disregard, as though the replies to what you've said are magically "not there". THIS ISN'T MERELY ABOUT THE CENSUS. It also doesn't mean that even when the census is concerned, we should regress to the less accurate, less scientific and thus less truthful informative models that are used and could still increasingly be used. Aside from the fact that I don't believe your argument and intention have anything to do with proper identification of "\textbf{ethnic} minorities", I also don't think you WANT the social perceptions of people you identify with to change, because you want white Europeans to remain separate and perceived as separate regardless of what accuracy entails.That's especially funny since we as a society argue so much about changing social perceptions and doing away with outdated ones that were based on incomplete ideas, little to no scientific accuracy and a lot of dogma and traditional bias. The census IS in fact one such place where you could easily make a change and open up the discussion to initiate the process of educating the public is, but instead you keep reverting to its inaccuracies and previous failures in a bid to argue for a continuation of the same thought process and same limited analysis that was always prevalent and is increasingly criticized."If such wasn't the case, then explain why modern \textbf{race} forms on the Census have an Hispanic/Latino category when \textbf{nothing} close to such existed on the \textbf{race} model?

As I said before, that, again, speaks to the lack of scientific accuracy in identifying what people's origins are. Indians are less \textbf{Mongoloid} and far more Caucasoid/Australoid, but depending on the region in India from which the individuals or families have migrated, that answer could change drastically. To clear confusion, it seems the geographic placement of countries in their respective continents seems in part to be at play here. None of this means that the Census is correct in fudging accuracy in order to avoid confusion - it's just an explanation for how perceptions aren't necessarily based on hard science.Why would we be using the exact formulations from "the original \textbf{race} models"? It's fairly clear that genetic and racial studies have made progress in leaps and bounds over the limited original visions of 'racial groups' that the science was identifying in its infancy. I'm not sure if you're transplanting a limited view from the past to the present because of some other limited views from the past, or if you think that because the origin of racial and genetic studies have their roots in less accurate and less complete science, then the whole things needs to be thrown out altogether, which is something scientists haven't done because they can identify with better precision where which parts of the original ideas were flawed or incomplete and to what degree."The examples I'm providing prove that \textbf{race} on the Census has little to do with science and more to do with social perception."You've already "provided those examples", and they've already been argued to be irrelevant. \textbf{Race} on the census in all likelihood had to do with both science and social perception, and what it was has \textbf{nothing} to do even with what it is, let alone what it should be. You're basically - in the same breath - both criticizing the outdated and backwards social perception element in the theoretical original reason for the census, and attempting to stick to the same methodology so that it suits how you'd like people to be viewed."Oh, and wasn't there a point when the Irish, despite being Western Europeans, were considered nonwhite?"The Irish were considered non-white by the British and Anglo-American elite because of their unwillingness to stop resisting the power of the elite and of the crypto-Talmudist oligarchs who ran the show. Are you saying you agree with all of the original misconceptions based on political and social classifications and efforts by and for the elite nobility, monarchs and their sociopathic kin?"Furthermore, Middle Easterners were considered Asiatic prior to 1910."Uh? No. Middle Easterners weren't counted in earlier census records because their numbers were insignificant in the U.S.; they weren't "considered Asiatic". They weren't considered anything in particular.

Yes, I have. That doesn't change the facts of the matter. I don't "refuse to acknowledge" anything. Refusals of acknowledgement can remain your own forte - I have no need nor use for them. That's a part of being scientific and paying attention to the excruciating details. I care about what things mean and imply. You're trying to insist that Middle Easterners and North Africans should get their own category, despite how incredibly massive and diverse a group of people that would encompass - many of whom don't relate to one another much at all - and your only reasoning for this seems to be your magical, limited and simplistic ideas regarding their overall complexion.If you want to add a specific category for "Middle East  North Africa", you're not doing anything to add accuracy or proper representation. You can't even seem to outline how/why the large group of people you see as "your people" are "your people" at all. A girl from Northern Iran and a guy from Southern Tunisia, for instance, may have as much - and as many - ethno-genetic and phenotypical difference between them as a guy from Ukraine and a girl from Bangladesh. You're not selling me or anyone else who can see what you're trying to do on your nonsensical "our own category" demand and implicit claim."Simple logic would beg the question, if what was once labelled the '\textbf{Mongoloid}' \textbf{race} could be broken into three separate races ('Asian', 'Native American', and 'Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander'---four if you can't the 'Hispanic/Latino' additive) on the Census for specified identification purposes, why can't the same be done with what was originally 'Caucasoid'?"That's a logical fallacy, because you're drawing an incomplete comparison and the basis for doing so is predicated on a false assumption that the larger racial groups "no longer apply". Caucasoid and \textbf{Mongoloid} still exist as the larger racial groups that the minor \textbf{ethnic} (sub-racial) groups fall into. Hispanic and Latino aren't even "\textbf{Mongoloid}" (for the most part) despite their wide variety of ethno-genetic admixtures depending on region and country, but even if they were, then they along with the other \textbf{Mongoloid} sub-racial groups would still be mentioned as \textbf{Mongoloid} AND a part of their own specific \textbf{ethnic} groups.If you want every \textbf{race} to be broken down into their \textbf{ethnic} groups, then there wouldn't even be a magical "Middle Eastern" group because of the great deal of diversity therein, let alone "Middle Eastern  North \textbf{African}". In other words, why not mention the racial group that people belong in with the specific national \textbf{ethnicity} they (at least by self-assumption) descend from?"It could simply be split into "European-American" and "Middle Eastern/North \textbf{African}"."That doesn't tell the census or anyone else anything useful - it just says that the person's background roughly relates to a large and diverse region, which could mean their background is anything. Would you call people "Asian" similarly if they're from Japan, Azerbaijan, Israel, Thailand, Yemen, Lebanon and Pakistan? Weren't you even trying to bring up the example of Indians previously being "categorized as Asian" and implying that it isn't accurate or sensible (correctly in that instance, despite the overall point being irrelevant)? Hell, even 'European-American' is idiotic and simplistic.A person from Spain differs noticeably from an Estonian, just as a person from the Netherlands differs noticeably from a Turk. You either stick to the general racial categories with only the same minor and accurate, legitimately-representative scientific break-downs, or you break it all down into \textbf{ethnic} groups that actually relate to one another significantly or noticeably enough. Regional proximity, cultural similarities, shared linguistic roots, cross-national connections and complexion/visual likenesses aren't indicators of people's \textbf{ethnic} identities. In fact, none of the aforementioned should be conflated with one another."Specified data on the Census makes understanding America's demographics easier for everybody, and most Americans, whether you want to believe it or not, view Middle Easterners and North Africans as racially different from whites/Europeans, regardless of what anthropology says."Most Middle Easterners, Asians, and Africans may also view themselves and others through limited, uneducated and socially-/environmentally-corrupted lenses. Again, why would you want to appease the ignorant and unknowledgeable? Quite a few Americans also realize that North Africans aren't similar to Middle Easterners (that one is all you and a minority of other, specifically-misled people). You're making a self-contradictory argument, because if you want "specified data", then you'd be against your own incorrect presumptions. Identifying people who relate less to one another than even they themselves may realize would be regressive. No one cares what ignorant and uneducated dimwits think - we're working to elevate the discussion above backwards and archaic assumptions and propagandized/politicized identity management."And \textbf{race} on the Census is mostly about social perception"No, it's NOT, full stop. \textbf{Race} isn't a product of social perception for anyone. Social perception is idiotic. If you leave it to social perception alone, given a climate of deteriorating information and public knowledge, you may see Egyptians being called "Africans", Indians being called "Asians", and Mexicans being seen as "Native Americans". It's especially interesting for you to continue trying to draw water from that well when social perceptions wouldn't even match what you conveniently want to tel the world and yourself. The people of the Middle East and North Africa don't see themselves as "Middle Eastern  North \textbf{African}", whether you'd like to accept that fact or not. So if you go by social perceptions, you still wouldn't like the outcome. You can at least just admit that you want to go by your own specific perceptions."so again, it makes more sense for us to be identified separately from whites."No, it doesn't. None of what you said gives any credence to your demands and desires because your logic is flawed as outlined and reasoned above. You can't rationalize selectively by making side-arguments that don't address the meat and broth of the issue. You try very hard to make an incorrect and incomplete argument asserting that the census is all about "social perception" (which it isn't, especially given that social perceptions are backwards among the \textbf{common} man), and that since that's what it is then that's what it should remain (which it absolutely should not), but you even go one step further and claim that since it somehow and supposedly should be based on "social perceptions", then just the "right amount and method" of specification needs to be applied for you to receive your own wishful, made-up, ethno-cultural classification that can also continue deceiving and misinforming people by being on the census as well. Whatever point of pride and joy you have in being a part of your fantastical "Middle Eastern  North \textbf{African}" cartoon kingdom or whatever it is, it's limited to yourself, and at some point you'll have to accept that even within the Middle East, North Africa and Europe your particular vision of "specified identity categories" would be laughed at and mocked by anyone who knows even just a bit more than the social average.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African, Common, Ethnic, Ethnicity, Mongoloid, Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}19/1244 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.527 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I'm not sure where you got the idea that the Sami, who are a very small population in Finland, are somehow representative of the majority of the Finns. The people of Finland do have some Sami mixed into the genetic stock, but not nearly enough to even consider them "mixed-\textbf{Mongoloid}". As for the Sami themselves (who aren't pure \textbf{Mongoloid} either). The Finns who "mixed" are for the most part Finno-Ugric Caucasoids and they mixed in small part with the Nordic (mainly Swedes). Also, facial features aren't an indicator of genetics in and of themselves. Even if they were, they wouldn't make any difference in this case. A full-beed Finn doesn't even come close to looking anything like a Mongol, and neither would a Khazar (less so the Finn). Families of languages are also not indicators of people's genetic stock. In many cases throughout history, a language has been adopted or forced on a culture and people without any matching transfer of genetics. Also, your argument regarding Northern Indians and Pakistanis seem moot - what point are you trying to make? I'm already well aware the they were Indo-Aryans by ethno-racial identity and culture (including language). Lactose Intolerance also has very little reliability as an indicator of anything. There are people in varying regions of France and Norway who are almost identically related and yet display completely differing levels of tolerance to lactose. The same can be said for different members of the same family. Indo-Aryans in Northern India didn't mix with the Australoid, and the Slavs for the most part didn't mix with Mongoloids.

I never wanted to be white, and throughout the entirety of my life, I've been considered anything but it. My grandparents didn't want to be white, either. Even back when they got to the states (late 1950s) they identified as people of color. They hated white people. Especially my paternal grandpa, who still holds a grudge for the way he was treated by white Americans and white America from a societal standpoint.2. You cannot compare the landscape of the U.S. back to when Middle Easterners fought for whiteness to what it is now. I'm not justifying what they did, but back during that time, the overwhelming majority of Middle Eastern immigrants were Christian and were often lighter-skinned. A number of them DID assimilate well with whites and DID benefit from white privilege. Also, our population here was next to \textbf{nothing}. Today, however, the demographics of MENA Americans has shifted greatly. Our population has exceeded 5 million and there are far more Muslims and darker-skinned MENA people who face significantly more prejudice than those who fought for whiteness. MENA folks like us do NOT assimilate well with whites and do NOT benefit from white privilege. The fact is, we aren't considered white by any stretch except on the Census, as shown by the plethora of news reports that only label our \textbf{ethnic} group "terrorists" but white people who do the same as "mislead individuals". There's always the debate of "white terrorism" in contrast to Middle Eastern terrorism, which proves American government views us as racially different. But we aren't identified properly on the Census, and we deserve to be. 3. The minority privilege is only ONE minor aspect of my desire (as well as numerous other MENA people) for our own category. We simply want to be identified properly, and our requests are finally being understood by Congress. Stop assuming everything is predicated on wanting some type of benefit.   4. I'm gonna go out on a limb and assume you're just another white Republican who has no idea what the majority of MENA people go through in this country. You think you do because of Eurocentric political channels like Fox News spreading the false narrative that "\textbf{racism} is dead", "everyone has equal opportunities now", and "no one should care about your feelings". Bottom line, you DON'T know nor understand the obstacles we face on a regular basis.

Actually, most Europeans either have ancestry from the Middle East and the Armenian/Georgian region, or from the region of Mongolia and Russia. It's \textbf{crazy} right! That's why that day, I was fighting with Tony Montana about being Caucasian. As scientists say, the early genetic features of the first Caucasian people are exactly similar to ours, and some features changed (like skin tones, eye colors, hair colors) due to epigenetic factors (factors that are related to the surrounding environment). Let alone Southern Europeans that carry our blood for a second. Do you know recent researches suggest that Northern Europeans (Scandinavians) are our descendants. We, the Arabs, are Semites, and for us, the Jews, and the Assyrians (and other Semitic nations), the main genes are J1 and J2. Northern Europeans have I1 and I2, which is produced from the J chromosome as scientists discovered. Also, they say Irish people are related to us in a certain way. So of they look like us, it's because we are the origin, and they are our far descendants.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Crazy & \cellcolor{green!27}Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}1/191 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.524 \\  \hline

The second figure is synechdoche (majaz mursal) consisting in using the whole for the part: intelligence to mean the specific legal testimony of a \textbf{woman}, and religion to mean the prayer and fast at the time of menses.Numerous verses and other narrations stress that the reward of women equals that of men even if their acts differ. So this particular narration is not meant literally but as an acknowledgment of the power women wield over men while ostensibly less active in the public and spiritual spheres.In fact, the Prophet married because of intelligence.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/166 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.602 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@TheNomdeguerre Oh, did I? I didn't notice. Well, let us analyze that.  Loll, Allow me to respond. First of all, for the bulk of history, such marriages were \textbf{common}, and they were never seen as wrong. Heck, in many parts of your Western Countries, Marriage with 7 year olds were legal. Either way, Aisha (Blessings upon her) was never raped. She had underwent physical and psychological maturity, therefore being considered as an adult, by the definition of the word.If she was, as you say, "raped", she would have underwent physical and emotional damage. However, throughout her thoroughly documented life, there was never any hint of any physical or emotional damage.Furthermore, adulthood is qualitative, not quantitative, which is why so many Western Countries can't even agree on what quantitatively constitutes adulthood.What's more, Aisha went on to become a political and religious leader, therefore remaining in the public sphere. If there was any damage, it would have been apparent. But there wasn't any. Ergo, she was an adult, despite her \textbf{age}.Now, to conclude, I am assuming that you are an atheist. Now, upon looking at Atheistic codes of morality, the ones that I find to be prevalent are social pressure and consequantialism.Now, using these 2 codes of morality, you will find that there is \textbf{nothing} wrong with this marriage.ÔªøAgain, there is \textbf{nothing} to justify, and you appealing to emotion will not work. The facts remain that different people mature differently, and since Aisha was physically and psychologically mature, she would be considered as an adult. And either way, this was a productive marriage, and she spread his teachings around the world. She only had good things to say about him. And you can't call it stockholm, as stockholm doesn't work like that.Again, I ask you, WHY is it wrong. I have gone through the 2 atheistic codes of morality trying to see if they'd call this wrong.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@DownFromTheSky89 A glimpse at the subject of Women in Islam: I must state that this whole "Oppress Women" thing is not Islamic. Nor are they 2nd class. There are many proofs for this.1) The Prophet Mohammed's first Wife, Khadija, was his BOSS. HE used to WORK FOR HER. She was his EMPLOYER.2) BEFORE ISLAM, men used to Marry many, MANY WIVES, MISTREAT them, DISRESPECT them, and they could divorce them whenever. The WIFE had to COMPLY with everything her husband told her and COULDN'T REFUSE or DIVORCE. That was BEFORE ISLAM.HOWEVER, ISLAM put LIMITS on POLYGAMY, gave women DIGNITY, RESPECT, and made them TREATED PROPERLY. Women were given the RIGHT to DIVORCE. Women were also supposed to consent in marriage,  as the MARRIAGE ISN'T COMPLETE without the BRIDE ACCEPTING.3) Women are NOT to be BEATEN according to Islam. The bigots and radicals pick out verse 4:34, and say it allows them to beat their wives. However, they are wrong. That verse says if you fear that your wife is CHEATING, you must ask her to stop. If she persists, you must not sleep in her bed. If you catch her cheating, the worst you can do is TAP HER in a way DOESN'T HURT, people mistranslate this as "Beat" even though it says TAP LIGHTLY,  and that is permissible only AFTER the PREVIOUS TWO didn't work. The verse starts off saying to protect/preserve them.4) BEFORE ISLAM, men used to consider having DAUGHTERS and no sons as an EMBARRASSMENT. They used to BURY their NEWBORN DAUGHTERS in hope that the "gods would grant them a son". ISLAM STOPPED THIS. Surah 81 was revealed in order to put an end to this. In fact, the Prophet Mohammed only had daughters and no sons. I suggest you read SURAH 81, with this piece of knowledge. (It's not a long Surah)5) Mohammed's Wives and other WOMEN RODE their own CAMELS in the same land where Women can't drive today. 6) Before you bring up the inheritance difference, you might as well know that in Islam, women have more monetary freedom than men. Men are limited in their spending, as they have to spend on the family.  Women can use their own money on whatever they want.7) The reason why 2 women are required in the place of 1 man during a property case is because we burden our wives and mothers so many responsibilities,  and being a witness is a huge responsibility. We wish to not burden them so that they may enjoy.üòé Women are NOT to get punished for being raped The rapist is to be punished while the victim is to be given money by the government. In fact, 4 witnesses aren't even required for rape cases.9) In Islam, Concubinage requires consent of the concubine. Rape of a concubine automatically makes her free, and gets the rapist punished. Also, children of concubines are considered legitimate, and set the concubine automatically free, even if stillborn. Either way, it doesn't really exist to that degree today.10) The Prophet Mohammed had more wives due to sociopolitical reasons. Usually they were to end conflicts. Also, he only had one recorded concubine, though some sources include her as a wife. Again, this was okay, and there was \textbf{nothing} wrong with it.This mistreatment of Women is due to people mixing their Pre-Islamic culture with Islam, the BLAME belongs to the CULTURE, NOT the RELIGION.Also good to know: at a time when people followed Sharia Law, the FIRST degree-granting UNIVERSITY was FOUNDED in Morocco BY a MUSLIM \textbf{WOMAN} at 859.

They will be of \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} faces, flat noses  and small eyes; their faces will look like flat shields, and their shoes will be of hair.'3-the tall¬†buildings and tunnels to be constructed in mecca : When you see tunnels/canals being dug in Makkah Mukarramah and the buildings (of Makkah Mukarramah) higher than the peak of the mountains then know that Qiyamah is close.' (which means it is something to occur before the end of time)I can go on on the evidences that proof the prophet Muhammad was a real prophet, as he can not possibly knew these prophecies and much more except from God,but I think the most powerful proof is the personal experience. when you really know that you are weak and deficient as all creatures, and the only powerful one is God the merciful, and you realize your need for Gods help, at that moment when you pray truly to God, and God answers your prayer. when you thought it is impossible to have what you wanted\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Blind, Quran, Red & \cellcolor{green!27} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Ethnicity - Native-American, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments, Religious Identity - Muslim & \cellcolor{green!27}5/309 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.618 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Jezz Ezz and this isn't an argument about skin color, I'm simply telling you that Armenians are not European in any way, shape, or form. We are Southwest Asian ethnically, and that goes for both Western and Eastern Armenians. Western Armenians are considered Middle Eastern because of genetic origins. Armenia 150 years ago was an enormous \textbf{nation} that encompassed northern Iraq, Syria, Western Iran and Eastern Turkey. Western Armenians mostly derive from those areas, therefore have J1/J2 (Middle Eastern) DNA. Eastern Armenians derive from Transcaucasia and have about 30 DNA that is parallel to Europeans, but that doesn't make you European. The rest of your DNA is exclusive to West Asia, and as I said before, the reason many Eastern Armenians have lighter skin, hair and eye color is because of a Nordic gene influence which can also be found in other Near Eastern groups, it isn't exclusive to Armenians. And as for color, Armenians come in all shades. My own twin brother is pale with dark brown hair, yet I'm olive-skinned with jet-black hair. My mom is olive-skinned, my sister is fair-skinned, my father is brown, etc. Some of us have white skin, most are olive, and some are brown.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small GradeA's Kid Exactly. She claims Armenians are white (and earlier claimed we are European which is undeniably false) because there are Armenians in her family that have white skin. Well, there are many Native Americans and East Asians that are paler than Southern Europeans, so if we're going by skin color, many East Asians/Native Americans are white and Southern Europeans are non-white. The majority of the "\textbf{black}" \textbf{race} doesn't have \textbf{black} skin. Many of them have light brown or even a yellowish (light-skinned) complexion. So are those people not considered members of the \textbf{black} \textbf{race} because their skin isn't literally \textbf{black}? It's amazing how so many people fail to understand the fundamental difference between \textbf{race}/continental origin and skin color.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Jezz Ezz Europeans were referred to as "Caucasians" because Blumenbach----an 1800s German anthropologist---based racial classification on similarity of skull structure. He believed people from the Caucus mountains had the mot beautiful skulls, hence decided to name the white \textbf{race} after such. This method has been proven outdated for several years now, as he didn't take genetic composition into account, which is why most rational people have gone away from using the term. Genetically, Europeans aren't even remotely similar to North Africans, nor South and West Asians. Even true Caucus people are quite different genetically from Europeans. Now that we have the ability to conduct such studies, most rational people have gone away from using the term "Caucasian" to refer to whites or Europeans.

White people didn't become white until Caucus and Near Eastern \textbf{ethnic} groups migrated northwest into Europe for better farming conditions.

Of course there are different \textbf{ethnic} groups within the region, but Kurds, Armenians, Persians, Arabs and Georgians----although all different from one another---still share many similarities with each other more so than with Germans or Ukrainians, for instance. So West Asian is a pretty applicable term that's used pretty often, actually. And either way, I still don't understand why you're trying so hard to be accepted as European. Armenians, both Western and Eastern, should embrace their uniqueness and take pride in being different from Europeans culturally, genetically and geographically. Evidence aside, I simply find it shameful how badly you want to be aligned with a group (Europeans) that doesn't share much in \textbf{common} with you other than having fair skin. With the exception of Greeks (because most of their traits were inherited from Anatolia), there's not a single European group that's similar to Armenians in way, shape or form.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small white? try native and yes, we are generally at the bottom of the discrimination barrel. that is beside the point, though. the point i was making is that the term \textbf{race} is inaccurate. i think it defeats and deflects the real issue, which is discrimination. there is only one human \textbf{race}, which is why all human beings can successfully reproduce and have reproductive offspring. a horse and a donkey are not the same \textbf{race} which is why when they reproduce the result is a mule, which is sterile. \textbf{race} is a diversion and we quibble about that rather than discrimination. labelling it \textbf{race} makes it possible to argue for categories of people resulting in a dominant '\textbf{race}' claiming that others are animals. we are all animals, all the same species and our differences are based on culture, not \textbf{race}. sorry you interpreted my comment as dismissive.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}6/146 & \cellcolor{green!5}4.11 \\  \hline

Host of the Oscars Ellen DeGeneres said 'Tonight, there are so many different possibilities. Possibility number one: 12 Years a Slave wins Best Picture. Possibility number two: You're all racists! Now, for our first white presenter, Anne Hathaway!' That was funny, especially coming out of Hollywood. Racial politics seems to be the norm in the United States especially if you listen to the main stream media and its new propagandist, the Reverend Al Sharpton on MSNBC. An analysis by the Washington Free Beacon said that 'MSNBC host Al Sharpton mentioned \textbf{race} in some capacity a total of 314 times on Politics \textbf{Nation} in 2013.' \textbf{Race} is often used by the media to divide and conquer people at least in the United States especially between \textbf{black} and white. But the fact remains that there were millions of Africans transported to North and South America have been tortured, murdered, raped and  exploited for¬†slave labor.¬† \textbf{African}-Americans suffered a great deal because of the slave trade, and many still do today.¬† Many cultures throughout human history have suffered the same fate. Whether \textbf{black}, white, indigenous, Jewish or Irish, human tragedies have taken place. \textbf{Race} and class wars have played a part in many of these crimes against humanity. Sometimes a tyrannical system such as fascism or extreme communism for example, under the leadership of Pol Pot in the 1960's¬†who imposed slavery on society.It is not just the human history of one group over another that we should acknowledge it is a systemic problem of our society. Slavery existedthroughout all regions of the world.¬† Many people were slaves including the Irish, Jews, and many others.¬† It was and still is a system of the¬†elite class who wish to rule¬†humanity because of their status. Today a modern-day form of slavery exists through debt.However, there is a piece of history not mentioned in history books or in Hollywood movies. It was called 'Anti-Italianism' during the early 20th Century in America. Italian immigrants were seen as the enemy in the United States especially during a time of tensions when it came to employment and the economic hard times. Anti-Italian \textbf{immigrant} movements developed in several areas of the United States in the 20th century. In an interesting article called 'Dark Legacy' by David Pacchioli, it describes what filmmaker of Linciati: Lynchings of Italians in America, Heather Hartley discovered during her research:As she proceeded, however, Hartley's research turned up another lynching of Italians, then another. 'The more I looked, the more I uncovered,' she remembers. Accounts told of lynchings in Louisiana, Mississippi, Florida, Colorado, Kentucky, Illinois, Washington, and New York between the years of 1885 and 1915, some 50 killings in allPacchioli's article explains why the lynching's in the United States happened to the Italian community:The most egregious example, in New Orleans, was precipitated by a rivalry between two groups of Italian dockworkers. When the city's police chief was shot and killed shortly before he was to testify against one of these groups, Italian males in the city were rounded up indiscriminately. The New Orleans Times-Democrat captured the mood: 'The little jail was crowded with Sicilians,' the paper reported, 'whose low, receding foreheads, repulsive countenances and slovenly attire proclaimed their brutal nature'Nine Italian men were tried and acquitted of murder. In response, a large mob led by some of the city's leading citizens stormed the parish prison, shot nine men as they cowered in their cells, then dragged out and hanged two more. It was the largest lynching in American history, and although no one was indicted for the crime, President Benjamin Harrison subsequently paid reparations of \$25,000 to the Italian governmentIn ‚ÄòGuns, Goats, And Italians: The Tallulah Lynching of 1899' by Edward F. Haas of the North Louisiana Historical Association wrote:Six times in the 1890s Italians fell prey to American mob violence. Three of these tragedies happened in Louisiana. The most famous case resulted from the fatal shooting of New Orleans Police Superintendent, David Hennessy, in October 1890. Before he died, the chief reportedly whispered, 'The dagos did it.' Authorities attributed the crime to the Mafia and soon arrested a score of Italians. After a public meeting in downtown New Orleans on March 14, 1891, an angry mob that included numerous prominent citizens descended upon the city jail, and meeting no resistance, systematically shot or clubbed to death, eleven of the Italian prisoners. When an investigation excused the mob's actions, the Italian government severed diplomatic relations with the United States and briefly contemplated warWhat is important to understand is that many different people of society were affected one way or another by a society based on \textbf{racism} and exploitation. It is not just a problem of one or two groups. It is a¬†societal problem that we¬†face as human beings.¬† Slavery, torture and lynching hangs a dark cloud over all of humanity and understanding¬†our past would allow us to¬†better ourselves as a human \textbf{race}.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African, Black, Crow, Immigrant, Nation, Race, Racism & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}11/905 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.215 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The \textbf{Black} Arabs as described in 'Josephus' Antiquities of the Jews':Josephus was a soldier, priest and scholar who was born in 37 AD. His written works are seminal in western history and for many centuries were some of the most widely read and influential books of the western civilization. In the paragraphs that immediately follow, excerpts of Josephus' commentary on the Arabs and near easterners who were contemporary to his period are reproduced. See The Catholich Encyclopadia  [LINK] According to Josephus:'The children of Ham (note: Ham is the archetypal ancestor \textbf{Black} people according to Hebrew, Arabic and Jewish legends) possessed the land from Syria and Amanus (modern Jordan), and the mountains of Libanus (modern Lebanon); seizing upon all that was on its sea-coasts, and as far as the ocean, and keeping it as their own.Some indeed of its names are utterly vanished away; others of them being changed, and another sound given them, are hardly to be discovered; yet a few there are which have kept their denominations entire. For of the four sons of Ham, time has not at all hurt the name of Chus; for the Ethiopians, over whom he reigned, are even at this day, both by themselves and by all men in Asia, called Chusites. The memory also of the Mesraites is preserved in their name; for all we who inhabit this country [of Judea] called Egypt Mestre, and the Egyptians Mestreans.Phut also was the founder of Libya, and called the inhabitants Phutites, from himself: there is also a river in the country of Moors which bears that name; whence it is that we may see the greatest part of the Grecian historiographers mention that river and the adjoining country by the apellation of Phut: but the name it has now has been by change given it from one of the sons of Mesraim, who was called Lybyos. We will inform you presently what has been the occasion why it has been called Africa also.Canaan, the fourth son of Ham, inhabited the country now called Judea, and called it from his own name Canaan. The children of these [four] were these: Sabas, who founded the Sabeans (Editor's note: the \textbf{Black} Arabs, the Yemenites,); Evilas, who founded the Evileans, who are called Getuli; Sabathes founded the Sabathens (Editors note: the \textbf{Black} Hadramutians, Sabatha was the ancient capital of Hadramut), they are now called by the Greeks Astaborans; Sabactas settled the Sabactens (note: the \textbf{Black} Southern Arabians also called Omanites); and Ragmus the Ragmeans (note: a \textbf{Black} Arab section of south western Arabia mentioned frequently in Sabean inscriptions); and he had two sons, the one of whom, Judadas, settled the Judadeans, a \textbf{nation} of the western Ethiopians, and left them his name; as did Sabas to the Sabeans: but Nimrod, the son of Chus (the \textbf{Black} ancient Iraqi Arabs), staid and tyrannized at Babylon, as we have already informed you.Now all the children of Mesraim, being eight in number, possessed the country from Gaza to Egypt, though it retained the name of one only, the Philistim; for the Greeks call part of that country Palestine. As for the rest, Ludieim, and Enemim, and Labim, who alone inhabited in Libya, and called the country from himself, Nedim, and Phethrosim, and Chesloim, and Cephthorim, we know \textbf{nothing} of them besides their names; for the Ethiopic war which we shall describe hereafter, was the cause that those cities were overthrown. The sons of Canaan were these: Sidonius, who also built a city of the same name; it is called by the Greeks Sidon.'\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Nation, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}9/598 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.505 \\  \hline

But again, Eastern Armenians do look Slavic, so I'm assuming you've only meet Eastern/Northern Armenians, who are completely different genetically from Western/Southern Armos.

We have mostly J2 DNA (the gene type native to the Middle East) are much shorter, have olive to light-brown skin tone, almond-shaped Asiatic eyes (that are usually dark brown), dark hair, wide noses, pronounced eye-brow structure, fuller lips, etc. The genetic differences are because of ancestral origins. All Armenians originate from the Armenian Highlands, which stretched from Transcaucasia to Ancient Mesopotamia. Eastern/Northern Armenians derive mostly from Transcaucasia, hence they are basically Caucus mountain people. Southern/Western Armenians derive from territories that are now apart of northern Iraq, Syria, Western Iran, and Eastern Turkey, as each of these areas were once apart of Armenia. I'm assuming the Armenians you've encountered were native to the modern Republic of Armenia...These are mostly Eastern Armenians.

I don't want to be wrongfully labelled something that I'm not, and that's what you did by saying Armenians look like Balkans/Slavs, because there is not a single Western Armenian that comes close to fitting that description. And, honestly have it backwards...If anything most Eastern Armenians go to great lengths to force their self-proclaimed European whiteness onto everyone who appropriately labels them West Asian. They do this far more than any Western Armenian would emphasize that he or she is Middle Eastern. Most Eastern Armenians will have a conniption fit if you call them non-white and/or compare them to Arabs (even though genetic research shows that Eastern Armenians are not European). Furthermore, most Eastern Armenians think they are superior to Western Armenians because they are lighter-skinned with more European features, and believe they are more "pure" and are the "true Armenians" (even though genetic studies show that Eastern and Western Armenians have always had sharp differences in physical characteristics). They call Armenians who look like me "mongoloids" and "impostors mixed Arab and Turkic blood". So honestly, yes, I do get along better with Persians, Assyrians and even Arabs more so than Eastern Armenians because they don't discriminate against me and make me feel less Armenian based on my features. Western Armenians are different, obviously, as I've lived amongst many of them, and we don't make anyone feel less Armenian for being darker skinned. And why would I go to Armenia? My family has no ties to its modern region.  If anything, I view the modern Republic of Armenia as just a Soviet territory that gained independence, and its Russian influences are still heavy in the country today. As for my lineage (and most Western Armenians), my ancestry can be traced to Syria and southeast Turkey.

That's part of the \textbf{old} way of classifying people by \textbf{race}, when everything was determined by phenotype rather than haplotype. Back then there were only considered 4 races, and everyone fell into some subgroup of those races (and even Armenoid was considered "Europid" in the link you provided). Technically the concept of \textbf{race} is no longer even scientifically recognized, because since the advent of DNA screening, people from various continents and regions who look \textbf{nothing} alike have been shown to have similar DNA, due to ancient migrations. That means that some guy in Wales could be more closely related to you than some guy in Iran. Third, in pretty much all of the links you showed, the pictures of people looked like typical Caucasus people, not like Semites. Most of those people wouldn't look out of place in my Circassian/Cossack family.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Firstly, there is not a single Western Armenian that looks like a Caucus person. Not one. They literally all look like Arabs, Assyrians and Persians, and it has \textbf{nothing} to do with skin tone (albeit Westerners are much darker than Easterners) but the sharp differences in physical features. Google Artur Aleksanyan, the Armenian Olympic wrestling champ (Eastern Armenian), and actor Marco Khan, an Iranian-born Armenian actor (Western Armenian) to get a better idea. Secondly, the Armenian Genealogy Conference studies are not conducted by the church you clown, the presentation of the results are just held there. Scientists conduct the genetic analysis and determine the trace regions. which annually reveals that Western Armenian DNA is 90 or more Middle Eastern (comprised heavily of J1 and J2 DNA). Thirdly, J1 and J2 DNA IS what determines whether or not you're a Semite, NOT language. Migration patterns for language do not explain gene flow at all. How do you explain the fact that Kurdish people, who've inhabited Iraq for centuries, speak an Indo-European language? Or that Hindu, the language of Indians, is also Indo-European? Celts and Germans speak an Indo-European language as well, so I guess Pakistanis, Indians and Persians must be genetically related to Central and Western Europeans? Come on, now. And where did you read that Chechens have 80 J2 DNA?There's no way a Caucus group could have that high of a J2 composition. They're mostly R1b.

Lots of southern Europeans have West Asian ancestry. As I told you, my family is from the North Caucasus (I'm half Kuban Cossack and half Circassian) and my Ancestry test resulted in about 64 West Asian ancestry (55 Caucasus and 9 Near Eastern), 33 European (28 Eastern Europe and 5 Italy/Greece), and the remaining 3 was Central Asian. The way these tests work is that they go by the current samples they have in their database and then compare your results. It's not as accurate as mtDNA or Y-chromosome testing (which can tell you haplotypes) , but I guess it's somewhat accurate. It's more for entertainment purposes than anything else. And really, just because you are Armenian doesn't mean you're an expert on Armenian genealogy, and it doesn't mean that you automatically know more than someone who isn't Armenian.

My whole point is that you think whatever in-absolute or skewed genetic studies data you're getting on Armenians is 100 accurate. The genetic studies of Armenians remains widely unknown because of the centuries of diaspora for Western Armenians as well as the various genocidal wars and presumed \textbf{ethnic} mixing that took place in the Near East. You can't keep assuming that the studies you read are completely accurate. And I agree that this conversation is getting boring.

Of course whites deal with prejudice (although it's obviously significantly less than minorities), but what you don't face is a societal system that is designed against you. Whites aren't "privileged" per se, but you have a societal advantage when compared to minorities, hence the term "white privilege".

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Obe Wankanobi Lol you're missing the point completely. European white people have historically had a societal advantage over everyone in this country. In education, business, and even the justice system, European Americans have historically been given opportunities that other racial/ethnic groups were restricted from. Middle Eastern people have been treated similarly to that of Hispanics (a protected minority) and right now we're treated worse than they are. So the point of this debate isn't about whether or not whites mistreat other whites (because they do, like every other \textbf{race}), it's about the inherit societal advantage that whites have been given over minorities (which includes Middle Eastern people).

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Hmm, yeah you have a point regarding (western) European colonization, but really the only difference between their atrocities and the atrocities of other races is that the Europeans were the only ones to cross oceans while doing it. Is it any more wrong for Europeans to slaughter American Natives than for one \textbf{African} tribe to slaughter another \textbf{African} tribe? I don't know, both examples seem like instances of people acting like shitheads towards other people for stupid reasons. Anyway, to put those atrocities on the backs of all Europeans is wrong. Haven't you ever wondered why eastern Europe and to a lesser extent southern Europe have always lagged behind the west in terms of economic prosperity? It's because eastern Europe and parts of southern Europe were themselves victims of colonization from non-Europeans from the east and south, until as recently as the late 1800s. Turko-Mongols from Central Asia slaughtered and subjugated eastern Slavic people for centuries, and the Ottoman Turks did the same in the Balkans and Greece (while forcibly converting the population to Islam, a remnant of which still exists today in the Albanians, Bosniaks, and Pomaks of Bulgaria and northern Greece). And let's not forget the Moors in Spain, Portugal, and southern Italy. Slavs were sold in slave markets throughout the Mediterranean in the medieval era, and continued to be enslaved by Turks and Tatars as late as the 1700s.. Did you know that the English word "slave" descends from "sclave", an \textbf{Old} French word that itself was originally descended from the Byzantine Greek word for Slavs? And one more thing - have we all forgotten that the Arabs were also heavily involved in owning and trading of \textbf{African} slaves? Funny how modern racial politics in the west has caused the majority of the population to conveniently forget these parts of history.I know there seems to be this thought in the modern arena that Europeans, and only Europeans, were responsible for intra-racial atrocities, but opening a history book would tell you otherwise.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!5}4/335 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.194 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Tony Montana Maybe, but not necessarily, bro. Not everyone from the Caucuses is truly "white". People only believe this because Blumenbach, the German "\textbf{race} model" anthropologist, thought the Georgian skull was the most beautiful, and so after creating a \textbf{race} that grouped everyone that wasn't \textbf{black}, Native American and East Asian together, he made Georgians the phenotype and named it the "Caucasian" \textbf{race} after them. But the \textbf{race} model itself was based widely on pseudoscientific concepts and had racially-biased pretenses. Firstly, not all peoples from the Caucuses are "white". A lot of them have true West Asian features (dark hair, lighter-olive skin tone, bigger nose, darker eyes, etc.), they just aren't Middle Eastern/Semitic like we are so they don't have as much color we do. Personally, I think the white-skinned Caucuses peoples only look the way they do because they were raped by the dirty Russians, as the Russian Empire had power over the region for centuries. I think they all originally had West Asian features for the most part prior to the Russian Slavs savagely raping/breeding with them. So, the Caucasians may never have been as dark as us, but they weren't always white, either.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Tony Montana Well, every country in Europe is racially white, technically, because the white \textbf{race} wasn't born until humanity reached the European continent. But some countries are mixed with non-white blood. Portuguese and the Spaniards have a small amount of North \textbf{African} admixture. Ashkenazi Jews are mixed with our Middle Eastern Semitic blood and then eloped with Europeans, that's why a lot of them have our features but have white skin. A lot of Greeks are also mixed with our blood and/or \textbf{African} blood. Same with Sicilians and the Maltese. Some Eastern/Central European countries are mixed, too, like Hungarians who have a lot of East/Central Asian Turkic/Mongoloid blood. Albanians and Bosnians also have Turkic admixture.
