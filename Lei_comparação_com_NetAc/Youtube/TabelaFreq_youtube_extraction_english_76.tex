  \cellcolor{green!5}\small My guy and I are "unique' and today this is not recognised at all. We have both been through hell with people that were supposed to be our partners ( me 25 hard years). We have put up with horrible people to simply not be alone. This is bad for the soul and your self esteem and will grind you down to the point where you loose your sense of self and identity and become the "wounded walking" literally. He was on antidepressants and in a job he hated and had just moved in with his friends family and I  was living with too of my three older girls and very lonely. I met the worst guys on dating apps and just before I met him I knew a guy who had a partner and was using me and another guy who was very rough with me. I have been raped by different men even ex over the years and didnt think I deserved a good guy. He found me after going through many profiles. Is a bloody miracle.  So in the end thanks to dating apps I met a guy as \textbf{weird} and messed up as me. But so nice and very misunderstood. We are both so alike I was always a late developer and still am not like my \textbf{age} and dont care and ex never understood me . He says im the nicest partner he has ever had. I look after him and he works hard and looks after me. He is like a \textbf{old} man even though he is 26 and had a hip operation and will need another one later on . He prefers to only hang out with me and my older kids and grandkids. His dad is the same nice. They are both the nicest men I have ever met. He lets me live my life and I let him live his. We don't have much but we have each other. Would like to see only positive comments on here as their is to much prejudice against older \textbf{woman} and to much lack of understanding about why this happens and why guys in particular seem so threatened by it. The french president has a much older wife says it all really . He looks happy to me and so does she. Why be with a older guy who cant keep up with your youthful outlook on life that's me really. Older guys don't get me and my guy does.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small If someone is REALLY interested in older women for something other than a meal ticket or a mommy, these are my tips:1) Be emotionally mature -- there is \textbf{nothing} worse than dealing with someone that acts childish (young at heart and playful in a non-sexual way is good though)2) Be over 25 and have a college education -- I wont waste my time on anyone younger than 25 that isnt educated. There are studies out there that say that the brain has not fully matured till 25, and someone with just the minimum education hasnt had enough life experience to make a carefully considered decision. 3) Dont expect special consideration because you are young and she is older -- I wont treat you any differently, so if you assume I'm desperate you are so very incorrect. I see a lot of ESL scammers commenting here. Most older women aren't "easy scam" material. Most of us that are here have had this awakened by a younger man approaching us, not because we are desperately seeking a relationship.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}1/178 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.562 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small So many of these comments are about \textbf{sex}, which is bizarre. I'm not really even interested in \textbf{sex}. With the prospect of a possible long term lasing relationship I might be interested, but other than that I really could take it or leave it! Also, my attitude toward relationships hasnt changed. I'm not going to cater to and try to "win" a guy because he's young. This one guy that seems interested in me tends to be really B-O-R-I-N-G so unless that changes, I'm done before it even begins lol.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Sex & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/90 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.222 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Once women hit a certain \textbf{age} (40+) IME they become largely invisible to men in their \textbf{age} bracket. Instead, once men hit that same \textbf{age} range, they begin focusing on much younger women in their 20s and 30s, because they can. Society allows men to \textbf{age} and still be considered fuckable, no matter what they look like (for reference look at the male actors cast in movies and TV shows, and observe how they are allowed to look "normal" while the female actors they are paired with, are always very good looking). If you are a \textbf{woman} over 40, you will only be looked at by younger men if you are considered hot. Sorry but I think this video only applies to very young men. When those same men reach their forties, they won't look twice at older women unless they look like Gisele Bundchen.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}5/145 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.448 \\  \hline

Young women are full of energy and havent been jaded by men [as much as a women in her late 30s or especially 50s], their skin is softer, breast are much more firm, and their vaginas haven't had countless men in there.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I have a question for you Susan, I'm 47 and have been on a couple of dates with a 60 year \textbf{old} \textbf{woman}. We have great chemistry and connection. I usually don't reach out after our dates and wait for her to text me, usually 3-4 days. When she does I set up another date, her thing is she doesn't want to be tied down etc, so that's why I lay back on the texting or calling until she reaches out. My question is this, if you set up a date 10 days in advance, should you reach out, say around the 4-5 day just to see how her day went or just wait for her etc? I have heard of over pursuing and such, I just don't want to be rude either. What's your take?\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Old, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/136 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.471 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Disregard of men or women both gets olders and die. Both go throug physical changes. \textbf{Mental} development does not depend on \textbf{age}. Definitely we learn as we experience but it does not mean we all learn good things in life. Financial stability also do not depend on \textbf{age}. Many \textbf{old} men and women lives on government pension. So it is really depend on individual personality not on \textbf{gender}. Few women are more gifted than other women in different areas of life. But it depends on others what they want to get out of her. Few men have very different mindset up as compared to majority of men. So it totally depends on ndividual we are all individuals with different mind, body and soul so comparing one \textbf{woman} to other or comparing one \textbf{gender} to other is not logical.

Last year while I was working a seasonal position I would have conversations with a younger man I worked with; he is 20 years younger than me. We clearly got along very well and there was mutual interest then my seasonal position ended; he is a regular employee with the employer. I understand that his role at work is very demanding; he works Mon-Fri and many Saturdays and often takes work home. Also, he is currently taking a course that will help him advance in his position; the course ends March, 2019. What advice would you give so that we can reconnect?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The problem is, only very few of such relationships will last. Many (if not most) of such relationships are just relatively short \textbf{sexual} flings. If they are kept alive for a longer time, they usually have deadlines because of biological factors. Women in their 40s and even 50s can still be visually appealing if they take care of themselves. But they will inevitably reach an \textbf{age} when they can no longer arouse a man (unless he has a granny fetish). Furthermore, many men want an own family and obviously want a younger \textbf{woman} for this life stage.Best example is probably Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore. They probably had 10 good and sex-filled years. But when she hit 50 and he 35, he switched to young Mila Kunis and started his own family.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Once a \textbf{woman} turns 30, she has hit the wall. As she gets older, mother nature deals older women a nasty blow. The older womens tits start sagging, that's simply because the fibers in the tissue start to wear out. As an older \textbf{woman} ages, the weight she gains, goes directly to her ass, which in turn starts drooping.  There's a saying that goes like this, "Men \textbf{age} like a fine wine, where as women \textbf{age} like milk and spoil"In reality, the younger women will always beat out an older \textbf{woman} in every single way. In marketing and sales, the stats don't lie. Men of all ages love eye candy, fact. When Sports Illustrated has their annual swimsuit edition, it's always a hot and sexy young girl. You will never find a 30-40 year \textbf{old} model, not ever, and for good reason. Sports Illustrated, Magnum, and other magazines know what sells, and it's always, and will always be, the younger \textbf{woman} like it or not.  Same with Victoria`s Secret, Once again, It`s young women that model the lingerie, for the very same reason. No older \textbf{woman} past 30 will ever be featured walking down the runway for Victoria's Secret. In sporting events, what \textbf{age} group makes the cheerleader squad?? Most certainly not an older \textbf{woman}, never going to happen period!! So once again, the younger \textbf{woman} wins effortlessly!!An older \textbf{woman} will always lose to a younger more attractive model, and the stats, and numbers, don't lie. Restaurants such as hooters hire who for waitresses?? Lol, you guessed right, younger women!!! An older womans SMV (\textbf{Sexual} Market Value) goes straight down the toilet the older she gets, fact!! Even in the porn industry, guess what \textbf{age} group of women gets the most clicks?? (Hums the Jeopardy Game Show Tune)  Once again, It's the young 18-20 something girls, that are the bread and butter of the industry. Older \textbf{woman} will always finish last, when it comes down to a young hottie.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I am 27 years \textbf{old} and she is 57. We have been together for 5 years now. I was never into young women and always had preferences for older ones. Here is why:1) In my childhood I was told that \textbf{sex} is for grown ups, so I thought you have to be older to have \textbf{sex}. Therefore, I saw only older women as \textbf{sexual} objects and not younger. My target \textbf{age} has been 30-50 years \textbf{old}.2) I simply like the facial and body feature of older women. They have sharper facial features and softer bodies (ass, tits, and thighs), which I like. I am not into toned \textbf{skinny} bodies.3) Since I grew up in somewhat patriarchal environment, I have always seen women as home keepers. Thus, I look up to women who can take care of a house and clean, do laundry, and cook. Nowadays women don't take up on these things and they suck at cooking. I am yet to meet a girls my \textbf{age} that cooks better and more often than me. Just like women like to feel safe around a man, and know they can rely on him to fix the car and maintain the house, men like to be taken care of in terms of cooking and cleaning. 4) They are more aware of what they want. They can tell you whether they want casual or serious relationship, or whether they want to be housewives or working women. Younger girls are mentally unstable and this is exhausting to deal with. One day they want to be corporate managers, the next day they want to be sugar daddy's girl; one day they want to marry you, the next day they want to go study psychology in Denmark.5) I would expect they are less likely to cheat if in commitment since they realize the consequences better, and because they don't have that urge to explore as younger people (not just girls) have.6) I would assume they are significantly better at \textbf{sex}. I haven't been with anyone bellow 30, but based on what I have seen in porn, young girls are stiff in bed. I doubt that many of them can really enjoy \textbf{sex} that much. Older women are know how to enjoy \textbf{sex} because are more open with THEMSELVES. They would also let you know what they like and what they don't.7) You can talk to them about more than just about the argument she had with her girlfriend. Men like to talk sports, politics, science, etc. Younger girls' brain don't catch that frequency.8) Older women were much harder to get where I grew up and lived most of my life.

In that case, I totally agree that obviously, we should do our best to not let ourselves go, but we should do it first for us, not for the other person, that's the first rule for a happy life in general. Obviously, I like to see my man taking good care of himself (and I guess he would expect the same from me). But think about it, this is not even an \textbf{age} issue. I had a very meaningful relationship with a person much younger than me and when we were together both of us took good care of ourselves, I recently talked to him and boy oh boy, if we were together now, he would be the one looking older. No illness involved of course. So, in that case, you are right, but there will be a point where beauty will fade no matter what, for both men and women.  And what stays alive? The love we have for each other, the compatibility and all these things. So just talking about looks is reductive in the long run. But surely to start and maintain a relationship they are also a part of the mix.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/210 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.476 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small She is 100 True .But i Think as person people do not change quickly .Many Females are very crooked or stupid in their Behaviour Pattern even at an older \textbf{Age}. FRUSTRATED.Remember Affection happens due to multiple Factors. It include Behaviour at the Top.Healthy \& Balanced Personality.Ability to understand Problems.Ability to differentiate Between Personal Life,self Life Behaviour in Personal \& Professional Life.People have normally no Financial or cheating Thoughts if they Get Attracted towards another PersonGenuinely.There is always a professional \& Non-professional Behaviour Pattern Existence in every individual(both in male/female)It can be Easily Identified  by any experienced Male/Female.Many times people react without any professional ERRORS  on any individual due to HATRET of REJECTION or Non-Acceptance due to having LOVE RELATION with another person. Thinking everything is Fair in LOVE \& WAR.But remember people do not Like anyone or Hate anyone manytimes.They just keep a safe distance to Avoid any Form of Controversy because many times FEMALES \& even many REJECTED MALES have a HABIT to SPEAK FALSE STORIES to  harm the image of any BOY/GIRL in the SOCIAL/PROFESSIONAL CIRCLES because they have been REJECTED by the FEMALES to treat them as a close FRIEND.Many thoughts work together in a Relation between a MALE/FEMALE.Many times 2 people both Male/Female remain Good Friends.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small There is another, rarely acknowledged twist to this question: *Why Younger Men Love Older Women*... It goes way back to the time when aboriginal people on all continents were living simple lives and were not messed up by the European - Roman Catholic Religion + all the restrictions that came with it. In other words: In every pre-european contact society there were older/mature women who were initiating young men to their first, \textbf{sexual} contact with the opposite \textbf{sex}. It was very simple but very effective way to make young man aware of the fact that they will have to face this thing called "premature ejaculation" (something that most modern day men are not prepared to deal with) and, whenever it was needed, those older and more experienced women (aka crones) were able to correct all the "malfunctions" associated with the instinctive/premature need to procreate. There is this ancient East \textbf{Indian} book called "Kamasutra" that talks about the art of love making. It was so unfortunate that at the advent of Roman-Catholic religion it was blacklisted as an invention of a Devil Lol... In short, I encourage all young people (men in particular) to learn from the wisdom of your elders, let all that Roman-Catholic BS be just part of the history (not your reality), and enjoy your sexuality, providing you give the same amount of joy to your partner (regardless of his/her \textbf{gender})  ‚ô•‚ùÄ(~‚Äø~)‚ùÄ‚ô•\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender, Indian, Sex, Sexual & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Native-American, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}4/234 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.709 \\  \hline

They don't get upset üò† when they don't get their way on everything.The drawbacks are:  late 30's women who haven't had children get over ambitious of their parenting skills; less willing to try anything new or take risks; and take a long term view of an arrangement rather than living in the moment.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/110 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.818 \\  \hline

I think the general rule of thumb is to find someone that is relative to your own \textbf{age}, because they can relate to more things (especially historically)....

Some of us older ladies like myself have come out of a dysfuctional degrading relationship of 25 yrs with a older cruel Iranian man. My partner tried his own \textbf{age} and all ages and found younger women and women in general mistreated him as he a very nice guy simple. He was on antidepressants when i met him and he found me on the worst dating app and i didnt take him seriously as i has been mistreated and raped by older men and my ex and didnt trust any guy at all. It took a week of messaging and convincing me he was serious about me . On our first date he took me out for dinner and paid for a very nice motel for one night. I loved him the moment i met him and after being mistreated by a very selfish contolling nasty man 5 yrs older it was so nice to feel loved again. Older men and much older men i found are pervy and \textbf{weird} and confused and dont want a serious relationship and use you and block you while younger men will adore you and want you and make you feel like a queen why settle for less. I settled for less to long and gave my ex four great  kids who dont bother with their dad and even his family in Iran have disowned him. He is a user who used me and my mums money to get what he wanted and is a liar and a cheater. Who needs that in their life as i was always the better one i got put down and menatlly abused and made to HATE myself to the point i was going down a very bad path i have even tried sucide twice when i was with him as he made me feel that down about myself. I started seeing younger men by accident i though i would try a younger \textbf{age} and even my oldest girl was  worried but i proved all my kids wrong it took awhile my second girl who live with me was dad against it and it was bad as she was unhappy at the time but i got him to live with me as we both felt it was right and we needed each other and i have been better off ever since. Maybe you have a few issues i think with the whole older women and younger men why is it ok for older men with younger women i would cringe if my girls were with a really older guy yuck. \textbf{AGE} IS JUST A NUMBER. I have a ex friend who married a much much older guy and guess what she is really unhappy. I am happy finally and no its not all perfect but everyday i get kissed and hugged and told i am perect and he loves me. THATS ALL I NEED.

I'm a physically fit, \textbf{tan} Israeli- American from Florida with no kids. In the beginning, our \textbf{sexual} relationship was the essence of it, but then we really fell in love. At first I was embarrassed to hold her hand in public due to possible backlash and stares. After a while, I started to embrace it for what it was and would have no shame displaying any affection towards her outside of the house. It's funny because everybody assumes that she's a so to speak "sugar momma" to me. Except she's not because i pay for everything. Continuing our relationship promises no children for me but i'm willing to sacrifice that because I love her.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Younger men really don't "like" or need older women, you are living in deception if you believe that my dear. They may like the money they can get from them, or a quick "scratch for the itch", but as far as attraction goes, that's out the window my lovie! Unfortunately, women lose their "blossom" of youth very early in life. Then it's plastic surgery after plastic surgery to desperately try to get it back. Many spend their youth playing "hard to get", but suddenly here comes their thirties, and they quickly find themselves "hard to want". Then they rapidly become "cougars" who have to pay men for love and affection. Sad, but true. I saw a couple in their 30's the other day, and the \textbf{woman} already looked like the guy's mother. So yes, any way you look at it, a sinful lifestyle never pays. LOL! Satan promises the rainbow, but always brings the rain. Stop worrying about your \textbf{old} needy and lustful flesh. Start worrying about where you will spend eternity my dear one. Jesus loves you and died on an \textbf{old} rugged cross for your sins. And He knew you in your mother's womb. To mock this is only to mock yourself. Turn from your sin and pursue Righteousness. Hell is not a joke or a myth. It is a very Real place that Jesus warned us about over and over again. And remember, He's the one who never told a lie. They only way to escape the very real fires of Hell is to repent of your sins and accept Jesus as Lord and Savior of your life. He is the only one who can save.  If you have some time to read some truth, I will explain about Hell to you.Pay attention:In Hell, the fire is never quenched, and the torment never ceases. The testimonies of those who have been shown Hell (through verifiable NDE's etc.) say that the suffering in Hell is beyond human comprehension and understanding. And it is the Hell described in the Bible, exactly how Jesus described it and warned us about it. The heat, the thirst, the hunger, the sadistic torture of the souls; there is no scale to measure it with on a human level, and it's \textbf{nothing} to laugh at. Skin flaking off your body as the flames engulf you. The demons delighting in mutilating you and throwing spears through you. The spirit body has the capacity to feel pain beyond what the physical body can. This is real people, I love you enough to share the truth about it with you. Some have been in Hell for a few days, some for a few years, some for 400 years, some for 4,000 years, and beyond. Their condition never improves, it only gets worse. And they are aware of how long they have been there. There is no break, or rest , or comfort, only misery and torture. Of the approximately 150,000 people that die every day on earth, most are going to Hell. You need to take that fact very seriously while you have breath in your body. The Bible says that broad is the road that leads to Hell, and many (most) are on that road. So the fact is, Hell is not a joke or myth, and your friends aren't there waiting for you to party with them. Although Satan would be thrilled if he can sucker you into believing that so he can get a good laugh out of you, as you are ripped to pieces, and his demons mutilate you. So please, the chills you are feeling are a confirmation to you that what I've said is real. Jesus Christ loves you and weeps for you and wants you to come to Him and accept Him as your personal Lord and Savior. He is the only one who can save. Please accept God's free gift as time is running out. God looked through the annals of time and saw you, and loved you enough to send you His best, His only Son. And He sent Him to die in your place. To mock what I'm telling you, is to mock yourself. Do Not mock what Jesus did on the Cross for you, because He loves you. Flee from sin, and pursue Righteousness. Many of the people suffering in Hell are constantly reminded of the opportunities they had while on earth to accept Jesus. But they always laughed and mocked at it. They never realized how quickly death would end up surprising them. Now they are the ones mocked and laughed at constantly by the same evil that blinded them to the truth to begin with. What that means to you now is don't walk to Jesus, but Run to Jesus! His arms are open wide with tears in His eyes. God takes no pleasure in people going to Hell. But He gave you a free will, and will not force His way into your life. And don't give me the line about a loving God would never send people to Hell, Well, you send yourself there by not accepting His free gift to you. You are precious, and you are being warned now. Please heed this warning. I'm an \textbf{old} Colonel, Military Pilot Airline Pilot and I don't like typing on the internet, as I have better things to do with my night. But Jesus had me get off my lazy butt and write this. So it is obvious that He doesn't want to lose you.Satan never plays fair, do not be on the receiving end of His deception. Your soul is worth beyond all the kingdoms of the world, and Satan knows it, and he hates you for it. So whatever it takes to drag you with him into his eternal destination, the Lake of Fire, he will gladly do. Whether it's the deception of Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, reincarnation, tattoos and piercings, \textbf{sex} outside of marriage, Lesbianism, or living for you \textbf{old} lustful flesh, whatever it takes. The only way to escape the fires of Hell, is to repent and accept Jesus as Savior and Lord. Please do that now and repeat the prayer at the bottom. Many screaming in the fires and torture of Hell today would give all their treasures or riches for one opportunity to pray the sinner's prayer and accept Christ into their heart. You have an opportunity, they don't.Pray this prayer:Dear Lord God, I realize that I am a sinner, and that I'm in need of a savior. Please forgive me, I'm sorry for my sins. I believe that Jesus died on the cross in my place paying the penalty for my sins. Right now I confess with my mouth that Jesus is Lord and Savior of my life and I accept You now Lord Jesus. Lord God I believe in my heart that you raised Jesus from the dead. According to the Bible, I'm now saved, and Born Again. Show me how to live the rest of my life for you, in Jesus Name, Amen.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Sally McMurray  There is also the flip side of the coin Sally. Older men find younger women far more attractive than older women. But don`t take my word for it, you can do the research. On porn sites for example, there are ("Mature Women sections") and " Young Girl" (legal of course sections) Guess which category gets the most hits??  Same for cam girl sites. It's the younger girls. The 20 something girls are so much more popular than older women, that the stats are staggering. Guys of all ages like eye candy!! I don`t think you can refute that. Why is it that places like "Hooters" are so popular?? It`s because of the younger girls of course. You will never, and I mean never, Find a 40 year \textbf{old} \textbf{woman} employed in an establishment like that for good reason. In the marketplace, older women have no value. Afterall, what guy wants to look at a saggy pair of tits, and turkey neck, none!!  So for over all sexiness, I hate to be the one to break the news to you, but the younger girls beat out older women each and every time, and the stats don't lie!! Take supermodels as another example, there career starts at a young \textbf{age}. However, once they become to \textbf{old}, they pass the torch to the younger \textbf{woman}. Sports Illustrated will never feature an \textbf{old} broad in their swimsuit section, not ever lol ... Look at professional sports. What \textbf{age} group makes the cheerleader squad??

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@neoasura Maybe you've been with women (older or not doesn't matter) who didn't have their life together. Someone who needs constant reassurance has self-esteem issues. I am almost 42 and I remember that when I was physically at the top I was so insecure for... \textbf{nothing}? And now that I can see I'm not perfect I acknowledge it, I do my best to be healthy and happy, with or without a man is not important, and that's it :) I saw so many younger women being very insecure and when they asked me for advice I tried to help them if I could. I'm not saying I don't have any insecurity. Who says that is lying bug time, but it's how you deal with them that makes the difference. I found more mature women (without any underlying issue)  being more at peace with themselves than the younger and fresher women. And why older women should feel alone? What I mean is why the OLDER? Everyone feels alone from time to time. If they are needy is because they are insecure and that has \textbf{nothing} to do with \textbf{age}.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small If you want tons of kids (which many did back in the day, as a lot died), then you need to start banging women while they are younger so more are likely to survive. In return, women couldn't earn the same amount of money as men and therefore had to find someone with resources rather than someone they were attracted to physically. So older men and younger women were more likely to hook up (although if you actually look at \textbf{old} records, a lot of young people just married each other). However, in modern times most babies tend to survive and you can generally pop out a couple in your 30s/early 40s (later with IVF, but it's more of a hassle) and they will be healthy. And women can and do go into well paid careers, so no longer need to rely on men for resources. Which has massively levelled the playing field. Women can now date men because they actually like them, same as men do. If they don't find older men attractive, they can just date younger men. Young men in their 20s/30s can date a cougar and if she dies before him (likely) then he not only gets her resources/pension along with any kids they had (now grown and off his hands), but he can still have a second wife when he is older (and now wealthier) if he wants more kids. He can get the best of both worlds. In return, the women can focus on their careers when young and do the cougar thing later on. A lot of people don't really care about having kids anyway, so there is no 'ticking biological time bomb' for them to worry about.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}1/285 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.351 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small since you brought the \textbf{mental} answer, I'd like to contribute to this in terms of physical matters and \textbf{sexual} attraction and it's basically what I think is happening, an \textbf{old} \textbf{woman} does arouse a young man sexually and sometimes even more than a young lolly, especially good looking \textbf{old} women, and it's simple, a man's bio radar is looking for 2 things 1- reproduction 2- reproduction of healthy children, a mother-like non neotenous looking \textbf{woman} plays this mind trick that she fits being a mother, she is able to bear children but with the baby-face high school girl, that's mostly abscent , and if this mother-like \textbf{woman} who is say 40 50 is good looking and shows little to no signs of aging all over her body compared to women of her \textbf{age}, this means that she has healthy genes and she can bear healthy children unlike a young girl who looks fresh just because she's still young, thats how young people look like so her freshness is not a guarantee of  healthy genes the way it is with an attactive \textbf{old} \textbf{woman}.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Mental, Old, Sexual, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}10/183 & \cellcolor{green!5}5.464 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Let's put this into plain and direct language....Older women let's say around 40 +/- are open direct and know what they want with no games are much easier to get into bed.  Yes it's all about the easy availability of \textbf{sex}.  As long as she is still reasonably physically attractive she can get almost any younger guy for \textbf{sex}.  Both parties win in that the younger guy just wants easy \textbf{sex} and the older female wants to get validation that she still has \textbf{sexual} desire.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small What if ur n a relationship with an older \textbf{woman} but she had been emotionally damaged by other guys that got her pregnant \& then left her but ur n love with her \& still young to the point that u have to either choose to b with her or not? My career is very important to me but it requires me to build clientele \& network with others. But she is not sure of what she wants to do. Doesn't want to better herself or anything. Jus kind of n limbo \& basically looking for a man to save her. Am I jus thinking too much on it? Btw I'm 25 \& she is 37. I feel like I made the wrong choice of trying to move on without her but since I broke up with her she recently found a rebound \& now has feelings for that person. She has 3 kids \& I don't have any children nor want any. Is it worth risking everything I want to work for to try to work it out with her \& do both my career \& b with her? I feel like her only intentions n life right now r jus to b loved by someone \& make them happy but I love her \& n love with so much that I want to c her do better for herself instead of jus being settled \& relaying on someone to take care of her bc that's what all her past relationships been like. Should I save her or jus move on bc ikno that 80 of me wants to work it out but puts a lot of stress on me \& the other 20 percent is like "hey man ur thinking too much it will work out" \& jus carry on the stress of jus being with her \& making her happy plus the children too bc when I was n a relationship with her i was thinking to myself that it's not jus abt her, It's abt her AND her kids. I feel like that's a lot for a person my \textbf{age} to handle \@ the moment. Idk it's very very VERY complicated \& I felt like it's my fault bc i ddnt communicate with her enough to want to work it out. My family background has always been the type of men to do it all \& make sure there significant other is happy with them \& safe. But now she has kinda sorta moved on with someone bc she is so used to having someone next to her, have \textbf{sex} with , \& jus tlk. I want that with her but n the long run I want to make sure we r both financially str8 bc she has THREE teenagers to care of. Ikno it's not my responsibility but I feel like it is based off of how the way she views me. Ikno it's a long message but if I could tlk to u \& get some advice I would definitely appreciate it. Another thing, I jus don't feel like for me personally I'm jus not rdy for children to b n my life right now. I swear I wish I had more time to figure it out. Bc she is gorgeous as hell. Very loyal \& will do anything for her man. I don't want another man to have those qualities of that beautiful \textbf{woman} that I love. I want us to grow together but \@ the same time I push her so much to try to get a better job or do something that she loves to do but her insecurities get n the way of all that. I miss her so much \& wish this feeling would go away. We still txt \& tlk hoping that one day she would realize that she had a good man but \@ the same time I was the one to let her go. Idk I'm jus foolish \& maybe I did the right decision to break up with her but \@ the same time I'm feeling regret. I jus want us to grow together but the fact that I have to leave her a lot to pursue my career to make things better for us hinders us a lot. I feel like she wants a "stay \@ home man" \& I jus can't do that right now. I'm tryna make money for us to live comfortably \& b happy. Another thing is that idk if I'm jus strung over her bc when I'm with her i do lover so much but \@ the same time I kinda c myself with other women but when I'm without her i can only c myself with her. I know that sounds harsh \& sounds like I'm playing with her emotions. Am i the selfish one? Am I the one that's doing wrong? I jus can't c myself without her but the kids thing jus scares me. The fact that I have to b n her kids lives for the rest of my life. I jus wish things were different bc i really do love her \& care for her. I think I am selfish bc i dont wanna c her with anyone else bc the things we have been through \& the memories we shared would disappear if she is with someone else. I never been the type of guy to cheat on her or do anything of the \textbf{dumb} things that would break us apart. It was jus a lot insecurities she had that kinda turned me off \& Idk how to tlk to her abt bc she would get even more insecure \& that would mess our relationship up. Plus I have pressure from my older brother to come join him \& pursue out careers together but \@ the same time I want her n my life. Maybe I'm jus being a wuss \& don't kno what I really want.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small In my early 30s and I've been attracted to mature and older women my whole life, but my reasons are a bit different from most guys (though I agree with yours too), I'm genuinely interested in what your opinion would be on a few things. Sorry this is pretty long, lol:1. I act and feel way younger than my real \textbf{age}, and I'm behind my peers in terms of milestones, life development, and achieving things most people around my \textbf{age} did years ago, so because I'm still learning myself, I feel way more relaxed and comfortable with women in their 40s-50s I can look up to and get life advice from. While I'll do everything I can to help people and I can be serious and I really care about others, I have no idea how to BE the mature older one, which is why I wouldn't date a younger girl (like 18-25). I also don't want to be even remotely perceived as a pedo. Women in their 30s like me probably think I could never be boyfriend or stepdad material since I'm so far behind them.2. I'm very nostalgic about my past and I just love retro stuff in general. I easily bond with a 50 year \textbf{old} \textbf{woman} about the 80s (or a 65 year \textbf{old} about the Woodstock/hippie era), and I think it also simply reminds me of being a kid, because the same types of girls I liked when they were my 20 year \textbf{old} babysitters are now like 45.3. I have some \textbf{gender} identity issues, I have a strong feminine side and love to just hang out with them and kinda be "one of the girls". I'd just think older women would be more cool with that, and less cliquey and selective than younger women are. There ARE a lot of pervy older men, so it's understandable that young women are on the lookout for creeps trying to get in their pants, so I'm even more careful talking to younger female friends just to make sure they don't think that about me, which is one of my biggest fears. Older ladies invite me to socially hang out much more and it's awesome.4. Confidence. Which you brought up. I think it's so awesome when they just say what they feel and have that "don't give a fuck" attitude, and that can mean flirting with me or making jokes or just being extroverted and outgoing in general. When someone does that, i feel it makes me more comfortable and gives me the green light to do that too. 5. I don't have to worry about being cool like I do with girls younger than me. With a 20 year \textbf{old} (even mature ones), I'm always watching my references and also trying even harder to look young because there's always that fear of her thinking I'm \textbf{lame} and more like her dad than her if I talk about stuff I grew up with; or if I say something serious or mature sounding or give her advice. Again I'm just not comfortable with being viewed as "an older guy" because I still feel like a kid, just a VERY mature and \textbf{old} school kid if that makes any sense? It's like I'm perpetually 12 in 1996, lol.6. They're just sexier and more beautiful to me. The entertainment industry and so many men are brutally \textbf{ageist} and sexist towards them and it drives me \textbf{crazy}.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I enjoyed your video, Susan. Its nice to know there are other women out there like me. Ive been in a 1 year relationship w a hard-working, sweet,gentle \& good-hearted Jamaican man who is just a few years older than my son, and I have gone thru the gamut of feelings you mentioned in your other video. This was a barrier I had to break thru for my own happiness. I am in no way a cougar, and frankly, I resent the title because I never went out seeking younger. My relationship is also not just about \textbf{sexual} fulfilment. People show their ignorance when they make comments  Assuming its just about him being my boy toy, or that he is somehow using me for my money. It shows me how limited in their thinking they are, and it is sad they don't yet understand the reality of 'connection'. I'm with my guy because we CONNECT. Its that simple. And connection doesn't measure by \textbf{race}, \textbf{age}, looks, etc.    To SW Sweetie, in my own case, my guy not only has more income than me, but he treats me more than I treat him(because I simply cant afford it). I'm sure there are some younger guys who use more mature females for shallow \& materialistic reasons..in much the same way some younger females can use more mature men for their own financial \& materialistic gains, but its very limited thinking to assume that older instantly means more \$\$\$, and younger, less \$.    What gave me peace about my situation was this: None of us knows how long we have on this earth. Youth is no guarantee of long life. Younger choosing younger is also no guarantee of true happiness \& long lasting love. Peace, love and happiness is a precious GIFT. And if you are lucky or blessed enough to find \& have it, how foolish it would be to walk away from it. My guy and I make eachother happy. And that's all that matters. And, when/if it ends, I will still smile and be glad for the experience. -Melanie\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Race, Sexual & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/349 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.86 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I am 42 and my husband is 29.  I was coming out of a 20 year  marriage, and he was overcoming a personal and transformative tragedy of his own.  What began as a supportive friendship quickly evolved into love and the desire for a life together.  I never knew love felt like this....I had only ever daydreamt of it.  However, there were challenges; primarily my insecurities about the \textbf{age} gap.  Will he still find me beautiful when I am 60 and he is still in his youthful 40s?  Will he "wake up" and decide he wants someone younger?  What about children?  I have 2 grown kids, but he has none.  My fertility will inevitably decline as the years progress, and I feared I was robbing him of opportunity and a family, etc.  Funny as it sounds, he worried I may "wake up" when HE is no longer "young" looking visually, or because he is not as advanced in his career as an older man, or because he may not have all of the wisdom and experience he feels I deserve.  When we both realized how much of the best we wanted for one another, we decided to let our faith be greater than our fears. We have been together 3 years, married for 2.  We have traveled the country, explored each other, and provided each other the support and saftey to explore OURSELVES.....the greatest gift....acceptance of exactly who we are.  After 4 miscarriages (due to my \textbf{age}, most likely), we accepted that children may not be in our future.  A month after this acceptance, we became pregnant again....only this time we are expecting a healthy baby.  We had our 3rd ultrasound last week and the doctor says its all looking really really good.  Faith.  In him. In myself. In us.  Its bigger than any of my fears or insecurities.  I loved this video....despite my faith, I certainly DO need reassurance every now and again.  Beautifully said....it was very touching and so appreciated.  Cheers to everyone on this beautiful journey of love that transcends time.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I always felt comfortable around older folks than those....my own \textbf{age}, the maturity and life experience is a luxurious trait. I compare to spending time with my mother,  aunts, grandma, etc. There's certain characteristics you can find within certain \textbf{age} ranges, my personality is combination of childlike (active imaginative, curious, optimistic, fun, etc) and old-soul (equanimity, resilience, laid-back,  meditation, etc). With younger women, I hear they're looking for a certain archetype perpetuated by the media and western culture; e.g. bad-boy, rough-neck, etc. Also, there's a lot of head-games but these games don't really stimulate the head, but confuses it. There's a lot of energy involved, but it's like...they're never really content and always look for a roller-coaster high, a fiend for the dopamine lol. But wait a minute, maybe this has to do with mentality and culture more than an \textbf{age} number we constructed?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Honesty, younger girls are still in training to become Batman and not all of them have a really good role model at home or within their family, and does the ones talking about. Also the younger kids right now are the Millennials and they are a different kind of breed. I know I'm going to get hammered for this but a lot of women today or young ladies are giving women a Bad Name by their immaturity there craving for men's that are set up and that could take care of them, and those that are totally sucked in by Hollywood. That's why I stand up and support women to become independent, well-adjusted, and  down to earth. Their beauty should come from within, where their strengh and whizdom lay. Women need to be encouraged and supported. Most women I probably say all women had faced some sort of trauma in their lifetime whether it be \textbf{sexual} harassment, \textbf{sexual} assault, rape, or molestation when they were little. Some women on the other hand try to do masculate men, meaning feminist, so which I am not. Men have Abused women throughout centuries so a lot of them have been socialized in certain ways. If you start respecting women they will start respecting men. Some of the comments on here regarding women and \textbf{sexual} actions are just despicable improve my point. Some women out there don't let these few ignorant jackasses affect you because they do not represent all the good men out there who are decent, respectful, kind and loving because they don't and give the male species a bad name\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Sexual & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/269 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.115 \\  \hline

They want to avoid paying everything, they also want to be appreciated for what they are instead of what they can provide, be a desire object, don't take too much responsibilities, access to \textbf{sex} easier... etc. These are the basic mindsets. Individuals may experience different things of course. The \textbf{weird} thing about older women is, they want younger men but still want to live like a princess. This is way too much. If you want a younger man, than expect to have more responsibilities, expect to pay for him, appreciate him for what he is. In that case you will be the man and he will be the \textbf{woman}. Youth and beauty are not free. Nowadays women can have younger for almost free, but this is changing fast because men are raising their standards dramatically. I was dating a 38 years \textbf{old} women when I was 20 and she still expected me to lead, to pamper her, pay for dates and activities... etc. Of course I got bored in just 1 month and left her. Then I was with a 35 years \textbf{old} she was more mature, bear more responsibilities, paying almost everything including dates, activities, holidays etc, usually pick me up after work with her car... etc. For me, it only works if the \textbf{woman} is in charge much more than me. If not, I simply go for younger women or women near my \textbf{age}.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Old, Sex, Weird, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}7/287 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.439 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small As long as you've found a formula that works for you, then all is well. Some older women are treated to dinners and trips by their younger men. Some are  given flowers,  and picked up in his car. How each older \textbf{woman} needs to be treated will define the type of younger men that she attracts. And, like yourself, I know a number of older women who are happy to be the breadwinner and the financial supporter of the relationship. Their partner's are not gigolos or users. They're good guys that love them, and also happen to have little financial resources. In this case the \textbf{woman} takes on the traditional male role.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/112 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.786 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I think my attraction to older women comes from a different place. Let me explain... in my case, the hottest thing I can imagine is an older \textbf{woman} looking at me straight in the eyes as her eyes accept and admit that she finds me sexy, as I hold her in a sensual way, while being really close to each other... my attraction to them comes from seeing a beautiful \textbf{woman} who "shouldn't" be embracing the possibility of getting with a young guy like me but yet we vibe so well that we just want to have \textbf{sex} and connect. The other things mentioned in the video are a bonus. Though being too straight forward can be a turn off, we do want to play a tiny bit, we want to chase a little.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Sex, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/134 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.239 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Hi SusanI met this lady last year. The first time our eyes locked she winked at me and I smile and I said hi. I like her immediately. We've been chatting for some months now. She likes my presence and I like hers.  I'm attracted to her and she's attracted to me. The thing is, she's super busy and she told me about it and I don't have a problem with that. We meet maybe twice a week for a very brief moment. There are times when we meet I can tell she missed me and there are times she treat me like a friend. I told her that I like her about maybe a month we've been talking. She said she likes me as well but she's busy and meeting her is on her schedule.My problem is, sometimes when we meet she'll treat me like friend and sometimes she'll treat me like a lover, sometimes we'll hug and kiss and sometimes she'll hug me with a distance between us and looking on the other side while we're hugging, like she's trying to avoid a  kiss. At first she used to take time to return my texts like hours to days and now she's responding more frequently. I think there's improvement on that area. When we meet she always update me as to what's going on in her life. Ever since we started talking I never been her house but she showed me where it is and she never been to mine. I don't know what to do because is like we're not going anywhere. She wants a friend with benefits and I don't have a problem with it but it's not going anywhere.

If we unusually dated, so many people would think we're mother \& son. We're not. She's too \textbf{old} for me, but if I was born N the year 1953 like her, we'd b dating. Maybe she was looking for someone single to mingle with.She probably divorced many years ago. That same evening, we had a party, we danced. Also we slow danced to a pair of songs. One was The Manhattans' "Shining Star", then a moment later, LTD's "Share My Love".I held her tight! Then she tried to jump on my back. I missed my chance to c her because I was \@ church :(Then N July 1999, we met again, we hugged, \& she said " I love you". Haven't seen her ever since. I thought I heard that she dealt with a situation with her father. But wherever she may b, I might c her with lots of white hair, 63 years \textbf{old}, a few wrinkly skins. IF...we were N a relationship, we'd b exchanging 's, stopping by our house more often, we'd also b sitting close to each other all day. I would like to c her dressed up N a bikini top, some mini jean shorts, \& some beach shoes. Or why wasn't she born N the same year as me, 1978?I can't believe I still remember that heartwarming evening. God bless her.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I agree with your 3 reasons.  I will add another: older women are often better, more enjoyable conversationalists and for a man who likes to chat about different things, different topics, this can work in his favor.  Your reasons will apply to men who already have their affairs in order.  My recommendation for older women who are interested in dating younger men is they find one who has his house in order, has a good solid life, knows who and what he is, where he wants to go in his life.  He may be further along in his career than most men his \textbf{age}, be more informed on current events, social, political issues than most men his \textbf{age}, have a stronger sense of responsibility, purpose, duty, greater interest in serving his community.  Also, selecting a man who doesn't place a high priority on starting a family (at least not right now) can also be advantageous as he will be less likely to focus on a \textbf{woman}'s reproductive potential, opening the door for him to date a significantly older \textbf{woman}. It takes a special kind of man who is willing to date women older than himself, he needs to have a strong healthy positive self-confidence,  a healthy inner strength.  This is the kind of man an older \textbf{woman} should look for in a younger man.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}4/224 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.786 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small You left out that young women (as well as men) are often after money, status. Whereby an older person is comfortable in who they are. My short story:My soulmate and absolute love of my life started out as my business partner and best friend (first). We had some 11 years of great times and wonderful memories. The worst part was that because she was older we worried about what would happen as time went by. It did as time will, and sadly she did get cancer and pass away after a long hard battle. Me by her side in 2013. I now am 46 and alone with those memories and thoughts of her. Not a day goes by I don't almost buckle into a ball for the pain of her loss.Her family, who I had a decent relationship found a way to get out of any legal wills etc., and paperwork she had in place because she had remained married on paper to her husband for reasons of convenience. Which she had planned to see her lawyer about prior to her falling ill.So the sentimental  keepsakes and the security her and I built up over that period of time in our business the family pretty much pillaged. Accounts drained etc.Like I said however, I have the wonderful priceless loving memories with her and no one can take those from me. There is a massive emotional void left however. I would of course still go through all that again, because she was the absolute love of my life and best friend any man could ever want. Just know, the pain can be incredible, dealing with family members and older friends painful as well. Their friends who may have seemed so accommodating, understanding and friendly may not be so kind after all when they are no longer there. I found that out the hard way. People who for over a decade I thought were also friends of mine I found turned their backs on me (which I can still not understand). I had not changed, perhaps it was without her my \textbf{age} was more apparent or those creaping thoughts of \textbf{age} + money= gold digger ideas resurfaced. Although those fires we long thought had been extinguished. So, there is baggage. Be prepared for it. Expect \& understand it and how \& where it will originate. People may be cruel and you may find yourself on the outside looking back in at what you shared being stripped away piece by piece while going through the most painful point in your life. For me, yes it was of course still worth it. I still dance with her in my dreams and she still strokes my heart \& soul.My apologies for my rambling.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/463 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.432 \\  \hline

When I was 26, a 39-year-old \textbf{woman} and I fell into deep love. Very sudden. Un coup de foudre, as the French say. It was wonderful. She was so mature and wise. It took her three months to cajole me into bed, and that side of our relationship lasted a couple of years. The love remains.There were misunderstandings and communication failures aplenty. I was young, and didn't know much about love. Now, I'm 66 and she's 79. We still love each other deeply. We are kindred spirits. It is still wonderful. Thank you. (You are magnificent, wise, very beautiful and brave.) (I have loved mature women all my life, never really cared for young ones. I was very shy, and found them scary. They returned the sentiment, and didn't have the time of day for me.) Keep up the good work.
