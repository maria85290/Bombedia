  \cellcolor{green!5}\small For people that never had experience with romani.Most of the stereotypes you hear about them are true, they are dirty, stinky, thieves and much more, heck, we in Serbia have a saying "Lying like a \textbf{gypsy}" used for someone that lies a lot. They can't integrate at all, the blocks they live in smells like garbage just like them.Most of them pass the school only because teachers give them passing grades because they feel pity for them.They also have a carriage which they ride through town, collecting garbage in it. Also the horse pulling it can just take a shit on the street and gypsyes won't do anything about, they just leave it there without paying any consequences.They also beg on the street, manipulating the emotions of people around them to get money (Like how 1 time i saw a \textbf{gypo} begging on the street with dirty, \textbf{old} clothes and flip flops. And then then that same day during evening i saw that same \textbf{gypo} with his buddies in a caf√©, he litteraly had that rapper look with leather jacket, jeans, shoes, cap and goldchains)Also to expand on the thief part. There was this one incident not long ago, where, ironically, a novel writer who part of his wealth spent on charities to help gypsyes, was beaten and mugged by 2 \textbf{gypo} kids (Luckly he wasn't killed).There's much more to be said but i'm just tired of typing :P\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gypo, Gypsy, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - Roma & \cellcolor{green!5}5/245 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.041 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Unfortunately the sad reality is that a "Roma country" would never work due to their entire culture being somewhat "parasitic" in nature. They never actually create anything, advance anything or whatever, their culture only "works" (if you wanna call it that..) because most of the world aren't like them. They need others to actually create things, advance things, build things, run things etc. for them to essentially "leech" off of.I'm not saying this to be mean or whatever but it's just the nature of that culture, and the relatively few Roma people who actually do well are the ones who've abandoned their culture. The culture simply is not compatible with the modern world or in any country based on rule of law.That's also why the stereotypes about them are the same everywhere they go. Usually stereotypes tend to vary and that's often how we can tell they're just stereotypes. In the USA they have the whole "Asians can't drive." thing for example but that's not a thing elsewhere so it's pretty obvious there's \textbf{nothing} about being Asian that makes you an inherently worse driver. If it was true, you'd see the stereotype everywhere with Asians and cars, you don't.On the other hand the stereotypes about the Roma/Gypsies are the exact same everywhere they go as a group, because it's all down to their very culture. It's not a matter of a small minority of them causing problems or whatever, it's the very culture. Everyone living by that culture will cause problems in the west, period.A lot of Americans seem to have a very romanticized view of the Roma/Gypsies though, I have no clue where that comes from but I've had Americans comparing the dislike of the Romas to the 1930's Germany etc. which is insanely ignorant. The Jews were hated for who they are, the Gypsies are hated for what they do. No one gives a shit if some banker, football player or whatever originally came from a \textbf{Gypsy} background as the problem isn't their \textbf{ethnicity}. If he's successful in the western world, clearly he has abandoned his culture and then he's not a problem.It almost seems like some Americans think the whole romantic image of a trading nomadic people traveling around in their horse carriage is actually true. lol Maybe it's also due to the few Roma people going to USA being the well off ones (It's expensive..) and the ones maybe trying to get a "fresh start" away from their culture.. Who knows..No matter how much people love to scream "\textbf{RACISM}!" these days, this issue has \textbf{nothing} to do with \textbf{race}. Well, not for anyone but the most extreme of far-right people at least, it's all about their culture. That's also why they're not doing great (as a group) anywhere as they simply can't fit in to any modern society based on rule of law, it's impossible unless they abandon their very culture. If a Roma/\textbf{Gypsy} then decides to get an education, get a job, obey the law etc. like other normal people, chances are that person will be "shunned" by other Romas/Gypsies. They've never been interested in integrating in any way, shape or form. You have to remember that USA was created in less time than the Romani have been a problem in Europe. It went from no USA to the USA we know today in less time than Gypsies have been in Europe, and even way back in the day their reputation was the exact same as it is today, as the culture really hasn't changed. It's just a shitty fucking culture, no matter how much you may like their colorful dresses, the romanticized "freedom" or whatever.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity, Gypsy, Nothing, Race, Racism & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - General, Ethnicity - Roma & \cellcolor{green!27}6/617 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.972 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small People often throw the Roma and Sinti together, and in Germany both groups were officially recognised as an \textbf{ethnic} minority requiring political representation and there is an organisation called the Union of Sinti and Roma. The Sinti however do not associate themselves with the Roma and consider themselves to be a different \textbf{ethnicity} altogether. The Sinti of Germany, Holland, France and Spain usually intermarry. Sometimes they marry local non-gypsies but less often. When they do, then the following applies: If the father is a \textbf{Gypsy}, then all the children will be considered Gypsies. If only the mother is a \textbf{Gypsy}, then the children are not considered Gypsies anymore; thus their sons never can have a say among the men when deliberating some internal issue. In the language of the Sinti, the word "Rom" simply means "Human". The languages of the Sinti and Roma have similarities but they have trouble understanding each other. Sinti has many words in \textbf{common} with Greek.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Common, Ethnic, Ethnicity, Gypsy & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General, Ethnicity - Roma, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}5/160 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.125 \\  \hline

And even if large portions of their groups or their cultural norms reflected ideas like that, I just don't understand how you can just dislike or even hate a whole group of people for that. Everyone is an individual, regardless of their background. They're just a different type of people.Anyway, pretty much no one around here knows anything about Romani people other than the phrase and stereotype of "\textbf{gypsy}" so this was nice to learn!!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gypsy & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Roma & \cellcolor{green!27}1/119 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.84 \\  \hline

People are people, and if a group of people is more likely to commit crime than another group, it will be for a historical reason.

These people considered themselves organized and advanced and ethnically superior to the barbarian northern Europeans who lived in huts and constantly raided them to steal their shit. Nowadays Italy and Greece are among the poorer European countries, and places like Germany are considered organized and advanced, and some idiots even think that they're ethnically superior to other groups of people.The fact of the matter is, Gypsies have been excluded from European society for hundreds of years.

It is true that they really love to party and often play loud music in the middle of the night, which is a tiny bit annoying, but overall the romani I have had the pleasure to meet are extremely nice, kind people. Unfortunately, though, here they are being heavily discriminated against, considered second-class people by some, and hearing people say "death to gypsies" is far from uncommon. They are the scapegoat that politicians blame for every single one of our problems to distract us from our misery while stuffing their pockets with our money. It is usually hard for them to find a well-paid job because of discrimination, so they sometimes turn to begging and/or stealing to feed their families.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small It's pretty funny seeing USA's minorities all racing to be the no. 1 victim of the country claiming \textbf{racism} and discrimination, while gypsies in the eastern europe deal with their racists by force because they can. Usually prisons offers better living conditions for most that belong to the tier that I like to call as "footsoldiers", the ones that do the action, the lowest tier they have. So even if they commit a serious crime, it's probably in their personal interest to get incarcerated anyway. I mean, in Romania there's no life sentence so why live on the streets when you can just go to prison, get to know others of your kind and learn from their mistakes, maybe get some new skills and tricks, and after getting out attempt to live the dream of owning a corrupted empire.Some of them, usually in the higher tiers, have some sort of code of honor. If you don't mess with them, they don't mess with you, especially if there's \textbf{nothing} to gain or prove wrong from that. It's the lower tier that likes to instigate and be chaotic. Which sometimes means the ones in the higher tier can just abandon them and let them be free to do what they want without any cover if they get themselves stuck in deep shit. But the moment they have a point and you don't, they will make sure both you and your family remembers it.It's true that the ones in the higher tier may have ties with giant illegal activities, but that can apply to any \textbf{race} of any country. They just have it easier because they have convenient access to manpower, unlike cultured majorities who usually need political sides and fake promises to achieve that.They are usually very united in their causes. Sure they have their own internal drama, and sometimes fights between their own gangs. But if something affects them as a \textbf{race}, they will band together and make sure that problem becomes a priority to deal with.No matter what's your opinion on them, imo easter european ones are part of the toughest of the minorities. \textbf{Black} people in USA who complain about their country are a bunch of pansies who use the slavery of their ancestors as a sort of extra points for getting privileges, and yet the result is that the future generation of those slaves are living a better life than in their original 3rd world continent. You keep hearing about Hitler how bad he was, but in the end the jews did get what they wanted because of him: Israel. But both of them won't shut up because they want more, that's how human nature works.All minorities face discrimination everywhere in the world, but 1st world countries deal with them by being a bunch of crybabies. 2nd world minorities man up and make their presence feared.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Congratulations. This is a very well-written analysis. I live in a country with a vast Roma minority and a great part of my childhood I lived among them.As for a possible location of a Romales country ... I think you're kidding. Even though the great powers of the world would agree to find such a place for a Roma state, this state would probably be never populated. As I said, I knew them well enough to say that I understood their spirit. The spirit of free people who did not like to be tied to any particular country or place or even to follow any other rules than their own local rules or customs.Even as individuals or as small groups, they can adapt to a certain place and can remain in the area for the rest of their lives, or until they are completely absorbed by the population of that region, but as a \textbf{nation}, they are the embodiment of the idea of migrating people, dwells or migrate where they felt better. Because, for thousands of years, they were never allowed to access these things, the notions of homeland, citizenship, or civic spirit is something that most of them can perceive only at the intellectual level not emotionally, being notions, emptied of any content, and that's why I always admired them. They are a very resilient \textbf{nation} that not only did not vanish throughout history (as so many other nations did), although no one loved them, but they will probably continue to last many centuries from now on. They are like water. Very hard to contain it for eternity, the water can take so many form and aspects, being almost impossible to be destroyed.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nation & \cellcolor{green!5}Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/286 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.699 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Let me just tell you the ways they are earning their money in Romania and Hungary (they probably do it the same way in other Eastern European countries).They usually send their kids to the city to beg for money. They also seek usable stuff in dust bins and they leave a huge mess around garbage containers and stuff. Another thing they love to do is to STEAL. One of their favourite materials is metal. They steal electricity wires, railway etc. Then they won't steal your wallet, phone etc. right? Hell no. They will. They will get it out of your pocket, they will steal your purse, backpack etc. They can even slit your throat if they want to. Another thing some of them do (which is probably the only thing they do that doesn't harm anybody) is that they go to the forest and collect mushrooms, flowers, raspberry, blueberry etc. and sell them. Most of them don't have a legal job. They get lot of money from the government (social help, kids money etc). And now let's talk about the 'business' they do. A lot of men go to Western Europe or Hungary (from Romania), Poland etc to 'work'. They obviously don't have a real job. They make a lot of money and come home, buy \textbf{old} sport cars and build 'castles' which look horrible by the way. A lot of gipsies have vans to transport stuff. Most of them have Hungarian (especially in the region of Romania where I'm from), Polish, Bulgarian or Italian number plates.  A lot of gipsies that can't read (most of them) buy their driving licence in Bulgaria and they don't even know the laws and stuff. The average \textbf{age} when gipsy women give birth to their first child is like 15-16, or even 13-14. And they usually have like 5-6 children, which is very high compared to the 1 or 2 children that Hungarians or Romanians have. Obviously most of them are illiterate, dirty and stinky.People don't hate them because of their skin colour,  but because the way they behave. There are by the way a few 'good' gipsies (for example there are quite a couple of great gipsy musicians), but unfortunately most of them are a\$\$holes.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}2/375 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.533 \\  \hline

It doesn't say anything about the individual, it says about the number of individuals. If the gypsies have an average IQ, of 74, 50 of them have IQ's under 74, 50 over, which also elucidates other things like the distribution, a group with 74 IQ will have way less people with IQ's over 130 than a group with 100 average. The fact that you have a degree and know gypsies that do means \textbf{nothing} to the group average, it's subjective.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small hey masaman, just wanted to make a few corrections for you. first off we pronounce our broad name "rum-knee" and my group "rum-nah chel". also the irish travellers, although similar in lifestyle and we do intermix and marry here and there, are not ethnically romani in anyway (unless mixed). the \textbf{traveller} groups that are supposed to be part romani are English and lowland Scotch travellers although they probably existed as a group before we arrived in the British isles and mixed. also most real Romani's wouldn't want their own country (at least not us in America) because unfortunately some of the stereotypes are true for some of us. my family have been honest businessmen for generations but i do know many con men. if a con man \textbf{gypsy} lived in a country full of his own people who he doesn't want to con or can't con because they know the deal, how would he survive? while more and more of us (the majority at this point) work honestly and follow the teachings of Jesus pertaining to morality we have a strong distrust for police and government. it's hard to tell at this point what came first, \textbf{gypsy} distrust of authority or the persecution towards Romani's.     i know many people on here have stories and bad experiences with Romani's and i don't doubt them. I will say that we much more honest here in America and here we are no more criminal than another \textbf{ethnic} group that gets painted with a broad brush, the Italians. I do hear in Europe Romani crime is much more rampant. I won't excuse their bad behavior but I do wonder if it's in part due to them being stereotyped and not given honest jobs as often. here in America most people just think (depending on the complexion of the individual) we are either Italian, Greek, or Mexican. we blend in easier here so I think we had an easier time turning from the con game. hope this was helpful, thanks for the videos bub\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnic, Gypsy, Traveller & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General, Ethnicity - Roma & \cellcolor{green!27}4/339 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.18 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small At some time in India's past, there were great social and political upheavals. A class-based religion called "Varna Dharma" was founded by brahmins and a warrior-class ordained as Kshtriyas began to carve out kingdoms of their own by conquering ancient democratic states and displacing entire populations from their homelands. These were times of tremendous oppression and genocide. These populations sought refuge in other lands.  Any unwanted and homeless people who are driven out of their homelands will naturally become segregated and end up in poverty and criminality. Thus emerged the untouchable classes of India.Evidently, the Romanis or Gypsies are from these native people of the \textbf{Indian} subcontinent who fled their motherlands in times of great turmoils. A large segment of the Naga people of \textbf{Indian} subcontinent have become untouchables under this Varna religion (mistakenly referred as hinduism). If you came across names like "naga" among the Gypsies \& Romanis, you can be sure that they are of \textbf{Indian} origin. Recently, Gypsies in Europe rallied under the name of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, a great intellectual who drafted the Constitution of India and laid the foundation of national currency \& the Reserve Bank. He himself was from an 'untouchable' class.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Indian & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Native-American & \cellcolor{green!27}3/199 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.508 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I'm Romanian from Moldova though people often tell me I don't have a European face. The hate towards Romani/gypsy people stems from Antonescu style dictatorship (in Romania) mentality or soviet influences (for post USSR countries). All of that mixed with strict gun laws in Europe (Romania has the strictest gun laws in the world) is a recipe for \textbf{racism} because if any person would shit in one's garden in the US, he has a good chance of getting shot and going to the hospital in the best case. That is just not something that can happen in Europe because of "\textbf{common} sense gun control" bullshit. Until Europeans learn to accept everyone regardless where they come from and learn basic self protection there will be toxic hate, snobbism and cosmopolitanism forever. Whining over Romani people is just a scapegoat just like complaining over migrants from Syria/Lybia which were colonized by major European powers.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small So i did read here a few almost \textbf{racist} comments and i agree and disagree with most of them :). On one hand, u have ur dirty romas living in tents, or ruins almost houses, in some camps or little villages created on a land that doesnt belongs to them, the land has their owners etc. we here called them if the translation is correct, colonies or settlements (just this simple). I mean those type of romas wont even clean up their own mess, theyll rather live in filth then do something about it. This is often because their children wont attend school or if they do, they do it pretty leniently i mean, sparsely they attend classes etc. At home they do \textbf{nothing} and sadly its just goes in circles, what i mean is that a solution for this a way out if u will is too hard to make, cause of their willingness to change their ways. People where i live most of the time want \textbf{nothing} else just them to live as in 21st century one should. They either refuse f nothings to be gained doing so or wont even listen to what do u have to say. They specialize for social help from the state and live from that. Some of them steal (thats sadly true) some of them even do murder or what they like to do, steal dogs for meat and \textbf{fat}, cause its some kind of remedy (they believe it is, well some of them do). These people barely speak native language in that state where im from. I dont really hate them im just telling how it is. This is the first group uneducated scum u could say although its not really their fault at least not the children, their parents on the other hand. As i was mentioning its a neverending circle until they decide change is needed. Luckily there are now a few examples of this change, building their own houses, buying that land for the house to be built on etc. Working too, there are now places where they can work. Its harder for them because most of them have only basic education so, ye, they can read and write and count to some extent thats about it. So working more lucrative jobs is just out of the question for them so they are stuck with lesser paid jobs. Still as i was saying many of them embrace this opportunity and trying to turn their and theirs children lives around. Many Romas i know are hard working ppl and they have where to live, have cars have jobs and can live normally in the society. Their children are raised to do the same, uphold the laws etc. But these are just few cases and those firstly mentioned make bad reputation for those great people and its pretty sad. 3:20 (so u can better imagine) is the depiction (or can be used for it) the second group, working and living in community as equals etc. 5:27 for example is the first type of roma ppl, those that make the bad rep. for all of them all over the europe or even world. And this is what we most associate roma ppl as, not that first one, but this. THis is not true, only part of it. Whose fault is that, well i dont really know, but could be the country where they live. Dont do enough to get them from that situation they are in. A great example is that, when a house burns down for a white family (im not trying to be \textbf{racist}, im just trying to make an image how it is in my country) they have to fend for themselves with the help of neighbors if they have the luck to have some great ppl living in the vicinity. If not they can rely only on family. Roma familys house burns down, the first kind i mentioned, what happens is they beg the state, they beg through media coverage for help, they beg the village mayor to make something for them, soem housing solution where to live etc. They expect the country/village will take care of them. Why ? Why should they care ? I mean yes its a tragedy, their whole life is gone, their things etc. But then why should anyone other then their family or friends help them ? They demand it even as they speak of this etc. ITs pretty frustrating that my family lost our home, we had financial problems, did we write some letters to media, did we beg someone to help us. No, we stick together and made shit happen so we wont live out on the street and be homeless etc. Now we live in a rented apartment and what, we pay rent, we are happy as we are now and working and paying what needs to be payed etc. We didnt beg anyone to help us, we helped ourselves. They wont do that. Theyll wait until someone will lend a helping hand. Im not saying its true for all of those first kind romas, but sadly thats mostly the case. I dont know if the state got them so dependent or they themselves did it. Could be both and now they are trapped. But as ive mentioned its getting better. Country is helping them to help themselves so they wont beg but theyll instead get up and do things for themselves. Cause mostly its not their fault what mess they are in. Im talking about only those who want a change for the better. Those who refuse are mostly those that are depicted in some of them comments here, steal, kill (extreme cases) or just simply beg on streets etc.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Fat, Nothing, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - General, Physical Identity - Physical Features & \cellcolor{green!5}5/963 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.519 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Regarding the question if the Gypsies/Romani could establish a state of their own I'd say impossible. First of all the number of Gypsies/Romani in countries like Bulgaria and Turkey is much higher than recognized. One reason for this is because some Gypsies identify as Turks or Bulgarians and due to their own \textbf{nation} forging concerns both host countries welcome this. However, similar to the case mentioned for Romanians in the video, average Bulgarian also does not like it when a Romani claims to be an \textbf{ethnic} Bulgarian. In fact the situation is so complex that in Bulgaria there are 'Bulgarian Gypsies'who speak Bulgarian only, 'Turkish Gypsies' who speak Turkish, and other Gypsies who have their own languages. Some of these 'Bulgarian Gypsies' will admit they are Gypsies and others will claim to be \textbf{ethnic} Bulgarians. The same is also true for the 'Turkish Gypsies' in Bulgaria who speak Turkish and some of them claim to be \textbf{ethnic} Turks while the rest will admit to being part of the 'millet'. However the situation is different in Turkey where the Gypsies are more integrated. There are Gypsies who admit they are 'Roman' but their numbers are dwarfed by comparison to those 'Romans'  who claim to be \textbf{ethnic} Turks and the rest of the population has no issues with it.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnic, Nation & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}5/217 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.304 \\  \hline

I had many in my \textbf{old} neighbourhood, so I used to follow them to see what they do, they lived in houses that I can only dream of, close to caravans snd scrap yards. You cannot go in their villages, unless you have a death wish. They don't go to jail, even if they did, they have more than enough money to bail themselves. The worse part is that, they go to other EU countries and do the same, but they don't say they are gypsies bur they say they are Bulgarian.

I do not think this was a custom, but kind of a reason why those "nomadic" people were prosecuted in such a harsh way back then in more "civilized" areas.

I had a crashed car in my driveway that was technically totaled because of a bent chassis, but the interior was in good shape and so was almost everything under the hood. I gave him the key to the car so he could sleep in it, and he slept in it for weeks.One day he asked me if he could sell the car battery for some pocket money. "Sure, go ahead." Then one day, I came home from work and the car was gone. I freaked out. I found him down the block and he told me, "I saw some people towing the car away. I thought the landlords called a tow company." I made him give me the name of the tow company and he gave it to me.I called them and demanded they bring back my car. They were like, "Well, an older man 'sold' it to us, and he had the key so we didn't think anything of it." I asked what he looked like. "Tall, \textbf{skinny} - oh, wait, that's him over there! Walking up the street!" It was the crackhead. You know how much he "sold" my car for? \$60 USD.

Let's face it, we still behave like the late asshole part of the Roman Empire.Thieving has always been a symptom of poverty, Europe has never been very tolerant towards the different or poor. And I'm being serious here: how do we expect this people to "get jobs and pay taxes" if they don't have the same values as us? To pay taxes you must be a citizen but they're nomadic and not bound by a country or \textbf{nation}.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I am from sri lanka and we had Gypsies with \textbf{Indian} origin.  We called them " Ahikuntika " and they were dirty and lived in one place for maximum of 2 weeks.  They were walking by foot from one area to another with  their children, women and dogs. Those women had a strange ability to read palms and once they made their camp for two weeks in a place, women tend to walk in to our villages (usually two women at a time) for palm reading.  We gave them a coconut, or 10 rupees for a reading those days. We never let them in to the house. But i have never seen their present generation or a \textbf{gypsy} camp from a long time.  It seems they have vanished and their children have spreaded and have become workers in the cities where the small jobs are available.

Sometimes we'd notice a whole bunch of them show up out of nowhere and set up camp on the soccer field in the village not far from my grandparents house. Of course it prevented anyone from using the soccer field for the week or so that they were there. During that time you would see them skulking around the village stealing all sorts of stuff. Then once they were gone the soccer field was a total mess with garbage strewn everywhere and the grass all ripped up.2nd was here in Canada when a few years ago some Gypsies started coming over from Romania and Slovakia. They would run various scams in Toronto, Montreal and Ottawa....maybe elsewhere too. I had an \textbf{old} \textbf{Gypsy} man with two plastic bags filled with "groceries", which were made to be ridiculously heavy and he'd come ask ask in an incomprehensible gibberish to help him carry his bags, which I did since I will always help the \textbf{elderly}, and then after walking a few feet away a younger guy slipped out from behind a wall and got behind me to try to pick my pocket.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The truth is 99 of them don't want to get integrated in the local society, the ones who make an attempt to integrate have to hide that from the majority since they will be stigmatised by their own people. In the past in Romania they were skilled craftsmen in metal working, but with developing of industry, vast majority of them don't work anymore and prefer to practice other trades, from begging to organised crime. They travel in groups and stick with each other if they get into trouble with Romanians they are very aggressive, assaulting them verbally until the poor guy prefer to walk away (after they tried to stole his wallet or something). Calling the police on them is useless since they are moving to another zone after one incident, unless you want to spend valuable time on the police station. They have low regard for human life, they sell their children between them in marriage at  from very low \textbf{age}, and they multiply like rabbits (one children means income and leverage in front of law, not responsibility).I used to work on Police Special Forces when I was younger and we had to raid a \textbf{gypsy} house in a \textbf{gypsy} ghetto. It was about a case of human trafficking. We entered the big house (almost like a palace) they were sleeping on the floor with horses indoors (they love their horses) and after we took the persons of interests the women started the show. They didn't care about the guns aiming they had to be immobilised aswell. One of them had a children sucking at her breast and used him as a throwing weapon at me from 5 meters, I was lucky to catch him. In most of these cases they have to be protected from them selfs since they tend to provoke self injuries and accuse police brutality. This is just a glimpse of who the gypsies from Romania are. Unfortunately when things at home worked very slow (Romanians spotted them from a mile away) they moved to other hunting grounds across Europe.

A European parent may not teach their kids how to cook but they will teach them why they should hate other people. And their education system tells them not to trust anyone even their parents. A Saudi colleague's kids were told at a UK school that they should not trust anyone and if their parents hit them they should tell it at school. And due to all this, the end result is that the European kids start hating their parents as soon as they develop understanding of their own. At 18 they leave their parents and the parents sadly die alone in \textbf{old} homes like discarded commodity due to Parkinson or Alzheimer's disease. You do not have to go too far back in the European history to realise what their hate is capable of, just 73 years. 1945 when Germans and their Hungarian, Romanian, Bulgarian allies did to Jews, Romas in Europe.

We are treated like normal people and have normal jobs. Most of the time in America, no one knows we're Romani.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Kushti is now a British English word (we stole it from Hindi, I believe),   You have to understand that the apparent intolerance for Romani in this very thread is not intolerance of your \textbf{race}.  You yourself are settled and living a productive and honest life.  I don't have an issue with you being settled or otherwise, but the fact you are living by contributing to your community is key.  The issue most of us have with Roma, throughout the Ameri-European eigth of the globe, stems from the dirt-poor travelling ones who for whatever reason can't seem to make an honest living and go around leeching from every community and committing an inordinate amount of petty crime.  There are so many of these bad apples and the numbers show it clearly.   There are travellers in the UK who are not of Roma descent, who live a similar lifestyle, commit a similar disproportion of petty theft/scam crimes and are the bane of many communities when they show up and rob the villages \textbf{blind}.  They are hated upon for the exact same reasons, and have traditionally been called gypsies as well, despite not being Roma.    A rich father of a friend of mine once had 'gypsies' move into a field next to his factory.  He installed some fresh-water taps on the side of his building, for them to use as they pleased.

They talked business or whatever, and after that the Romanian official was taken to a place where he saw a \textbf{Gypsy} beggar. The Germans told him that he is a Romanian \textbf{Gypsy} beggar and asked him to do something with him because it is not okay to beg on streets. Then the Romanian official asked the \textbf{Gypsy} beggar in Romanian, what is his name, what is he doing there, how did he arrived there etc., only to find out that that \textbf{Gypsy} beggar was from Serbia, he didn't speak Romanian language, but he was claiming that he is Romanian! Another fact: Serbian Gypsies came to Romanian border with Serbia and asked political system, claiming that in Serbia they are persecuted!Really, I'm sick of fake "Romanian Gypsies" who claim they are Romanians and spoil the image of our country!If you want to send those Gypsies somewhere, send them to India since they came from India!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gypsy & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Roma & \cellcolor{green!5}4/239 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.674 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small In some sources about religion there might be a monotheistic mountain-god or similar.Punjab/Rajasthan seems to be the area they inhabited.The exodus correlates with the Islamic conquest of Northern India.They might have been of a very low caste or high caste. Or rather a high caste that somehow  was outside of that system.The mountain-god and the high-caste-theory together with a culture where you are on the move could suggest a mountain-herding group of people.The reason why they/we where called gypsies is because of Egypt but not because of actual Egypt but because of from my tongue "little egypt" which was basically western Greece.It was a rich place at the time (Byzantine Empire... *coughs*)There are stories of a people living on an island there.Swedish Travelers came to Stockholm in Sweden 1512 (Before Gustav Adolfius).Claiming to be a duke with company from "egypt".They where in Denmark by 1410.Early Swedish Travelers and later immigration of the so called "gypsies" in the 1800:s have very different cultures.As to phenotype.Well. I'm blue-eyed. Really white. Very dark blonde to brown hair.Some cousins have dark skin.The Roma peoples have been very poorly treated in Sweden.My grandmother (born before 1900) had some child taken away from her when they tried to force them to be "swedish".As they did with the Sami people.They force-sterialized them. (threatened the children if they did not comply).The big problem was that travelers or Romani where not allowed to settle down.There where laws prohibiting it. Until very late.My father (born -33) wouldn't approve of me outing myself as a romani descendant.The stigma it has is really bad. Despite him also having blue eyes.I would say the criminality came with the status and not the way around.There where no social services and if you didn't have food you died.They took on the jobs \textbf{nobody} wanted.Including small metalwork like tinning copper pots.Horse-trading. Selling stuff walking the road (which wasn't much like roads today and no cars).They fought in quite a few wars for the Swedes and it seems like they where well liked as fighters.I'm doubtful that that would be a trait in genetics although there seems to  have been quite a bit of fighting and rough living that might have made them well suited to fighting.I sorta miss the history of my ancestors.The language. The dances. The songs.One of the reasons Romani where so opposed where that they where though to be spies of the Muslim Ottomans when in many cases they fled from them (or traveled with them doing what work they could).\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nobody & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}1/450 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.222 \\  \hline

In Serbia, where I was travelling with my mother, they surrounded our car at a gas station and started shacking it, because we refused to give them money. We had to pretend that we are about to drive over them, so they would run away.2. In Lithuania, my homeland, we had a \textbf{gypsy} guy in my school. He stole everyone's things, even ,y best friend's jacket (he was later seen in it). He went to jail at the \textbf{age} of 16 for 6 years (probably for a murder), and is dead now himself (killed by his ex friend).3. In Russia, when I was 7 years \textbf{old}. My mother, I, and my uncle, we were in a train and gypsies surrounded my mother and started 'foretelling'. While one of them stole my mum's purse. Fortunately, my uncle saw it and kicked the shit out of them and returned the purse back.4. In Jordan, local \textbf{gypsy} girl asked me for money and I refused to give any.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small They were brought in Europe as slaves, they were treated like livestock, after they were freed, they were marginalized. When Communism came to Eastern Europe, they were forced to work, but they didn't have any education, so they worked the lowest jobs. Some managed to get an education and became productive members of society, but most lived in poverty. Then Communism fell and many of them fled to Western Europe, saying they are persecuted and they got asylum. There their "talents" came in handy. Robbery, prostitution, human trafficking has led to many Gypsies making fortunes. They have built palaces in Eastern Europe, they control the police and the politicians. The majority of the Gypsies still live in poverty, even if the state has Affirmative Action policies for them in place, they still don't want to go to school and get normal jobs. The politicians are happy with the status quo, because the Gypsies all vote for the Socialists - the former Communists, and that's a good chunk of the votes, because they all go and vote. Their reputation is deserved, even if some of them are nice people. They are quite an interesting society, having their own laws, their own local leaders, judges, kings.   I have a few \textbf{Gypsy} friends, grew up with them in our village, but since they were the only \textbf{Gypsy} family, they assimilated within the local culture.

It is true, they were slaves and they were marginalized, but for more than 100 years (300 years in the Western part of the country) they had every chance to change. The Communists gave them jobs, free housings and free education (education is free for Gypsies even today, they have more rights than other citizens) and what did they do ? The French built whole villages for them, and what did they do ? Why are they sending their daughters to prostitute themselves, and chop their boys' hands off, so they can be beggars, when instead they can go to school for free with everything included ?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Rem Henshaw About the Jewish origin of the Roma¬†¬†Based on historical evidence and the claims of world-famous Finnish and Israeli ethnologists, researchers of Roma identity, such as Mr Ky√∂sti, Mr Roth and Mr Sandor Awraham, I have decided to write this article on the origin of the Roma. The historical part of this article was taken from the History of Ancient Territory of Israel and from a small article by S√°ndor Awraham Myths, Hypotheses and Facts  This article is also based on the ancient history of the territory of Israel. I considered it important to describe some of this piece of work, as this rare article accurately describes the historical events concerned.Historical outline Historians and ethnologists who claim that Roma come from India are mistaken because they rely only on unilateral knowledge. Their theory is based only on a linguistic point of view, and does not take into account Roma culture as a whole, which is more important for their identity than their acquired language they agree to. If we agree with this theory, we should consider all American blacks as English. This theory is speculative and not correct.  S√°ndor Awraham  Misinformation about the \textbf{Indian} origin of the Roma largely contributed to the Roma themselves, in order to deny their Jewish origin to invent various false stories about their true origins. But the main guilt in this matter can be attributed to counterfeiters and disinformers of ancient history. There are many Hebrew elements in Romany culture because they come from Israel and not from India and originally are Hebrew Israelites\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Indian & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Native-American & \cellcolor{green!5}1/265 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.377 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Rem Henshaw Pradesh. Particularly from this area of ‚Äã‚ÄãIndia, the Romans have learned many foreign words that they use today. The Roma then escaped before the war to Benares, but they were forced to move to the Ranchee area for the reluctant attitude of the local population. India is not the rulers of the Roma but it was only a temporary refuge in the long history of their persecution. They are not in any genetic family with any people living in India, nor did they have any elements from Hinduism. After leaving India, the Roma came to Europe via Iran, Armenia, and the Bosphorus, adding to them both \textbf{Indian} and Iranian nomads. In addition to their language, the only surviving sign is that the Roma also lived in India with several Skit-Sarmatan traditional expressions they appear in their habits. Abu Nasr Al-Utbi's claim to the origin of the Roma from Kaunadz is based only on the unconfirmed fiction of this irresponsible chronicler  author.¬†¬†¬†British colonial police in XIX. century, the Romans invented the nickname "gypsies". They also mistakenly called all \textbf{Indian} and Iranian nomads who had \textbf{nothing} in \textbf{common} with the Roma. Later, most of the European research was based on the erroneous assumption that the basis of Roma identity is the nomadic way of life.  S√°ndor Awraham  Only Roma were not nomads, they were persecuted nations for their Jewish faith! It is a big mistake of ignorance of Israel's ancient history of these researchers. They did not provide any evidence of kinship between \textbf{Indian} peoples and Roma! They only supported a false and misguided theory of the Indo-European origin of the Roma.

Author /¬†¬†Based on historical evidence, the results of ethnographic research, genetic comparisons, and the findings of the physical anthropology of the Roma are biased, questionable. The subjects of these research could not in any case be Roma, they could be only \textbf{Indian}, possibly Iranian nomads whom they seemed to consider to be Roma based on the arguments of these people about their Roma origin after their identity was lost. I refer to the Ancient History of Israel. On the contrary, when comparing the genetic maps of the Roma and the Jews, carried out in Finland and Argentina, their relatives' intimacy has been repeatedly confirmed. I categorically refuse the theory of the origin of the Roma from the \textbf{Indian} caste of the Impossible Dr. Tomas Kivisild of Cambridge University on the grounds that I firmly believe that Dr. Kisivild can not distinguish \textbf{Indian} nomads from the Roma. He apparently has no knowledge of the fact that in Europe only Roma constitute 25 of the so-called "Gypsies".

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I would love to know the genetic make up of Roma people to see if they really did come from India. Their origin as Hindu dalits is a fantastic tale created during the 18th and 19th century to denigrate Hindu caste system.  However, no one seems to explain how they still remain 'Indian' when they have mixed by culture and marriage with locals.  Language is an interesting tracer, but language could easily have filtered through due to waves of islamic invasions across Asia. Refugees and slaves could easily have created a composite language to cope with their new situation. As they moved on, they took the language with them. eg - Urdu is a composite language developed by the camp followers of the Mughal army. If helped them cope with a platheora of languages spoken by various \textbf{ethnic} groups that made up Mughal army. Yet, we can't say all those who speak Urdu are genetically made up of all those nations.

For instance she put her wallet on the lunch tray and never looked at it. Thus I made it disappear and asked her, if she forgot something, to which she replied with no. I then waved her purse around and said to her that I expected someone from Romania to be a bit more careful... to which she glanced at me angrily and told me that it only happened once to her that someone stole from her and that this was on a train-ride through Austria!On a more serious note, most of these East-Europeans were somewhat hostile towards gypsies and one Romanian got pissed when I assumed that she was Armenian or something similar.

Yes the land the original people that once occupied the region from Afghanistan to present India was greatly reduced through invasions and religious persecution. But the most fascinating thing to me is that despite numerous attempts to invade and colonize and pillage India. It has still retained its identity. The ancient Egyptian civilizations have been wiped out and replaced as well as Mesopotamia, the ancient Persians n Zoroastrians as well. Same thing happened with the indigenous people in Africa. Colonizers and invaders almost completely wiped out their ancient practices and ways of life and thinking. Now its western values and ideologies mixed in with the \textbf{old} traditional beliefs...Yes India may have issues  in terms of pollution, overpopulation,  and bad seeds but the US (which I was born and brought up in) has 1/3 of its population on anti depressants and anti anxiety medication.

Mad men from West of India kept attacking. In early centuries of it, indians must have made error of judgement that these are just another invaders who will assimilate with society like Huns and many central asians but these were religious fanatics.Iran fell to Arabs in just 20 years after Arabs attacking Iranian and Byzantine lands alike, but after that Hindus of Afghanistan (Zabulistan) fought and holded back Arabs for more than 200 years. It was only when Turks converted to Islam and started pouring in to Afghanistan that Hindus lost Afghanistan. Kabul was gone from Hindu rule just before 1000 AD and ever since Indians were in constant fight and struggle with invading Turks and later Afghans and Mughals, some times surviving by fighting back, sometimes by submission. By the time British came whole \textbf{indian} subcontinent was in utter chaos, though Hindus were resurgent. Hindus were set to win all of India again if British wouldn't have arrived. British won most of the India from Hindus/Sikhs and not Muslims.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small You do know that people can look "Irish" but not genetically be entirely that? In fact...even the Irish are not fully Irish. Or Irish at all. Ireland was not originally inhabited until humans came there from the mainland. So virtually all Irish and English are descended from ancient people who came there from somewhere else. Actually, Northern Irish and Scottish people have some pretty surprising genetics in some pockets of the population - some have genetic influence from Africa and Spain or as far away as Finland or even into north Asia. That is because Ireland and the UK are basically the last point of land for a long way, with \textbf{nothing} but ocean to the west of them, and so they became natural collecting places for people migrating from all areas over thousands of years. People on the fringes of the landmass always tend to be the ones where you find more interesting genetic signatures because it is where migrating people went who could go no further due to the water or due to cultural  societal barriers. That's the same reason why you find a lot of people in northeastern Europe who have some east-asian genetic heritage - including my Estonian family - even if they look fully European: northeastern Europe was the last bastion for paganism in Europe, it was more removed from the rest of Europe for a longer period of time, and it was close enough to Asia that people could migrate there over time without having to deal too heavily with the Christians in central and western Europe or the Muslim invasions in the South. Today, Finns, Estonians, Latvians, and Lithuanians, genetically, on average belong to Y-dna haplogroup N, which is an east-asian haplogroup shared with Mongolians, Chinese, etc, while almost ALL of the rest of Europe shares either haplogroup R1a or R1b as the most \textbf{common} in any given country. R1a is also found in India, and is associated with the rise of middle-eastern farmers who came to Europe thousands of years ago, bringing lighter skin color and farming practices with them (yeah, you heard me - the original hunter-gatherers in Europe were light brown skinned, not pale like modern Europeans). Estonia is another such pocket area where interesting genetic legacies are left: we have the highest percentage of ancient hunter-gatherer DNA and ancient paleo-Siberian asian dna of any living group in all of Europe. Why? Well, it is bounded on two sides by water, and wasn't really much on the maps of western European Christians until they began attempting to thrust their religion on us some 800 years ago. So the genetics are a leftover of ancient groups that came from the European mainland and from north Asia, while in the case of the Romani, they came from south asia and mixed with much of the European population for the past thousand  years. So it's not at ALL unlikely to find Romani DNA in people who otherwise look just like other Irish people.Funny thing is, people seem to fail to realize that the Romani are no longer "\textbf{Indian}" - some try to categorize them as "people of color" when in point of fact, after a thousand years in Europe, inter=mixing with the populations there, they are an entirely different group and are a EUROPEAN people - a thousand years is indeed long enough for a wholly new \textbf{ethnicity} to be formed. Yes, they are European now, and so calling all Europeans "white" doesn't work because it ignores the history of Europe for thousands of years: Europeans are mixed with migrants from elsewhere and always HAVE been. Estonians are the only ones who retain a truly large percentage of the original hunter-gatherer population, and even THAT population was originally much darker skinned than the current population is - we know from skeletal remains and the DNA they contained that the ancient hunter-gatherer population of Europe had \textbf{black} hair, light brown skin and blue eyes. A strange combination, but that is what the true ORIGINAL prehistoric European looked like. A far cry from the sandy-haired, grey-eyed, light-skinned people who live there today but who still carry their genetic legacy more than any other living group. Likewise, it goes with the Romani descendants.

What these people lack is education and a normal development that most modern European states went through in the 19th and 20th century. You could also argue that this missing development is the fault of the higher developed cultures, especially the enslavement and genocide of Romani people throughout the second millenium.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small FACTS: GYPSIES ( ROMA) are from PUNJAB - Northern INDIA. They were a miitary people from the LOHAR ( metal making caste). They practiced the HINDU religion and worshipped the Hindu Goddess Khali. Their language is a mix of Punjabi, Hindi, sanskrit anD Bengali.They were wrongly called Gypsies by europeans when they thought they came from Egypt. The correct word to describe Roma  \textbf{Gypsy} is 'Bhanjara' They were forced to leave their motherland INDIA, during the ISLAMIC invasions, making theii way through central asia to Europe. However they have retained many of their PUNJABI features. As PUNJAB is in Northern India live in a cooler climate and the land is more fertile, hence they are taller , fairer and more strongly built than south Indians. PUNJABI Indians were the defenders of INDIANS and are the ONLY people in HISTORY to defeat the Afghans in a war! If you look at PUNJABIS today they are still taller, fairer and better built than other Indians including Roma, who have lost some of their Punjabi heritage, due to mixing with other racial groups.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Devawrat Vidhatetl;dr: As far as gypsies are concerned, it's not the politician's fault for the state that they are in. They simply do not want to adapt because the state already gives them so much.Those are measures implemented by politicians, even against the will of the people. There are almost no \textbf{gypsy} politicians in our country. As far as I am aware, there's 3 seats in the parliament for the \textbf{gypsy} party and the party itself only has like 4 members. As an apropos, the party was made by the self-proclaimed "king of the gypsies", whom, of course, lives in a palace full with "legitimate"  gold and luxuries that he "bought" with his "money". The gypsies in our country usually don't register as citizens, which is why we can barely even estimate their numbers. Rest assured though, they live pretty decent lives for non-citizens. While they aren't citizens, their children are registered, only so that their parents can collect welfare money. I've only seen a census of people on welfare from 2010, but it did say that of the people registering for welfare, 40 of them were \textbf{ethnic} gypsies. I can kinda attest to that since both \textbf{gypsy} villages that I've visited usually only have a grocery store and a bar (which of course is usually full).\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnic, Gypsy & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General, Ethnicity - Roma & \cellcolor{green!5}4/219 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.826 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small God Particle They have the option to register as citizens whenever they want. There are quite a few that do, in fact. I had several (as they are often refered to as) washed gypsies (meaning gypsies that come from self-emancipated families) and they are just like any other citizen. As far as I know, it was never prohibited for gypsies to form a political party and obtain "representation". In fact, there are probably hundreds of \textbf{gypsy} politicians in parties that are not self-proclaimed "\textbf{gypsy} parties", such as the Social-Democrats or the National-Liberals. Even in The New Right and the Save The Family Union I've seen a few gypsies.As far as opportunities go, the only obstacle they face is their bad reputation, which they make a very good job of reinforcing, not only here, but abroad as well. Even the government stepped in (as I've mentioned in the first post) to help them by giving away free education and free learning materials (such as books, notebooks, backpacks, money, etc.) and they abused the system so much that it became a national joke for about a year (about how they stole school supplies, collected the money and never returned while there are kids in rural areas who have to walk kilometers to schools each day and sit in freezing classrooms). There was also a campaign to give jobs to gypsies, which was abused a lot in the beginning, but now some of them have started showing up to work. Unfortunately, the ones that do want to work mostly qualify as street cleaners.The situation is very complicated, but it's something that they bring upon themselves and they certainly had and still have a lot of options to get out of.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gypsy & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Roma & \cellcolor{green!27}2/289 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.692 \\  \hline

I just said that the haters are a PART of the problem. The hating goes of course both ways. No doubt that a lot of \textbf{gypsy} parents teach their kids that other different looking people treat them badly and imply that it is rightful for them to steal from them. Just like some parents from other ethnicities tell their kids how gypsies are thieves, lazy and not to be trusted. I know my parents said that to me a couple times when I was a kid. So I grew to be a bit weary of them. Then I realized that all gypsies aren't like that and I shouldn't prejudicate all of them just because what their culture's reputation is. Kids are what  their family teach them to be but the society around them also has an effect. I am not denying the negative effects the \textbf{gypsy} kids get from their parents. I am just telling that openly hating gypsies makes things worse.Because if you grew up in a society where you and your family are hated and prejudicated all the time just because what you look, would you feel like assimilating into that hating culture, going to a school and get a good job with those people if a lot of them where a lot of people were openly hating you for just because what kind of culture you come from.Gypsies are people too. There too are a lot of them who make prejudifications of other cultures just because of some people in those cultures.

If by part you mean any significant impact then you're altogether incorrect."No doubt that a lot of \textbf{gypsy} parents teach their kids that other different looking people treat them badly and imply that it is rightful for them to steal from them."Let me correct you, a lot of \textbf{gypsy} parents teach their kids that other, different looking people aren't gypsies and therefor it is rightful to steal from them. They don't imply it, they outright instruct their children to steal. \textbf{Gypsy} children who try to walk the path of decent citizens get criticized, ostracized, bullied and abused by their families first and then also their entire community. The only gypsies that get a grip on their lives are the ones that purposefully and willingly chose to remove themselves from \textbf{gypsy} culture and society."Just like some parents from other ethnicities tell their kids how gypsies are thieves, lazy and not to be trusted."That's called "great advice". Like teaching your daughter not to go down dark alleyways at night or your son not to marry for looks because he'll get burned by a gold digger." Then I realized that all gypsies aren't like that and I shouldn't prejudicate all of them"And what exactly changed your mind? Did it, perhaps, have anything to do with your university education?"I am just telling that openly hating gypsies makes things worse."They engender it towards themselves. I am not given to loving criminals. If they behave like human beings they'll get treated like human beings, regardless of \textbf{race}, creed or culture, but if they behave like vermin it's time to call the exterminator. \textbf{Gypsy} culture is inherently verminous, while there may be no need for gypsies themselves to be eradicated it's clear where their cancerous culture must go - the dustbin of history."Because if you grew up in a society where you and your family are hated and prejudicated all the time just because what you look, would you feel like assimilating into that hating culture"I grew up around Albanians, Albanians grew up around me. Macedonians and Albanians, as a rule, dislike each other and there's a great deal of prejudice and distrust between us(much of it is very much well deserved on both sides but especially the Albanian side). Most of the Macedonian kids on my street hated - and many still hate - Albanians and many - most in fact - of the Albanians in my neighborhood think themselves utterly superior to Macedonians. Yet I - and most of the Macedonian kids and most of the Albanian kids - am a functioning, relatively well integrated, member of society. We are even capable of cooperating and having friendships.Why? Because we chose to. Gypsies chose not to. Whether or not you believe society's dislike of your people is warranted or not it is to you, as an individual, to make good of yourself. If you chose to become scum then the plain fact is that you are scum, you've always been scum and you will always be scum and nobody's to blame for it except you. Gypsies have agency, same as the rest of us, they just refuse to use it for anything good." just because what kind of culture you come from"If you come from a culture of cannibals is it safe for me to assume that you're probably also a cannibal? You wouldn't got to a cannibal island in Oceania and give the natives the benefit of the doubt. So why should the same not be held true of a culture of criminals? Cannibals won't become less cannibal if you pretend they're not and criminals won't become less criminal if you pretend they're law abiding citizens. The only way to make sure criminals stop committing crimes is to punish them such that others will not want to follow in their footsteps."Gypsies are people too."I used to believe that too, and then I saw a \textbf{gypsy} crippling their own child so they'd get more sympathy out of people while begging."They most likely see the surrounding people groups as unreasonable haters the same way the other people groups see them as criminals."The difference being that one of those groups is correct and the other isn't....the correct one is the one that had their TV stolen.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gypsy, Race & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General, Ethnicity - Roma & \cellcolor{green!27}7/768 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.911 \\  \hline

I was both fortunate and unfortunate to witness a \textbf{communist} period, a long \textbf{transition} period to democracy and then the still going process of the Romanian society away from communism. My parents are still working although my mother is retired after 40 years of working and my father is also close to retirement \textbf{age} (he works since he was 16, so for 45 years already).The first encounter with gypsies as I remember it was as small child, some gypsies came about once a week or every second week in our neighborhood screaming that they trade new pots for \textbf{old} clothes. This didn't have much effect on me; I rather found it a bit strange.Then, as I grew up I started to meet more and more in different occasions. Just around the corner, close to my building, there were some gypsies selling chewing gum from Hungary directly on the street. It was funny for me to see that when a police car came, they pretended they actually are walking in that area. I also had a colleague in school for a year or so. She was put alone in a bench because she had lice. Still, we tried to play along; a colleague brought her food every single day so I can't say she was discriminated in any way.As a child, the curiosity makes you think more and more why some people are different and you just ask. I knew that the gypsies are for instance good craftsmen; they were good in working with metal. I asked my father why his company is not hiring gypsies and the answer was surprising. They are not reliable. They don't stay in one place to work every day, they don't respect a schedule so they refuse being hired. Wow!During vacations, I used to go for two weeks every summer to Baia Mare, a nearby town. I saw there an attempt to integrate them. They received apartments in a brand new building. The result: after one week, they burned all the available wood (parquet, doors and windows frames) in the middle of the rooms. I even heard about a horse looking outside a window at the third floor.Then the communism collapsed (I was 12) and the Romanian society transformed. All at a sudden, new "businessmen" appeared: more or less smuggling things over the border, Ukrainians selling things (we called them Russians) in the markets, small shops selling everything from socks to TVs in 10 square meters etc. In this environment the not so legal business started to boom.I need now to point out some differences between what we (Europeans in general) call "normal" values and what the gypsies are doing. 1. FamilyIt is quite \textbf{common} to arrange the marriage of their children at young \textbf{age}. They "promise" the children to each other when they are born and by the \textbf{age} of 9 in some cases they actually marry them to each other. This lasts for years and there is \textbf{nothing} really that can be done by authorities.As a consequence, they have children early in life, most of the time more than 4-5 of them. At this rate, they overwhelm the local population. Having children alone is not a problem, but as they don't work (see point 3), WE PAY for their allowance, medical care and so on.A very important thing for them is to brag and to show off. See the competition for houses, cars or gold. A new "architectural style" appeared in Romania in the last years: the "towered" palaces. The number of towers shows how important you are. They actually live in a small house, in the back yard but the house must be as big as possible.2. EducationIn our society, we are advised and sometimes pushed to go to school, to study, to get a good education in order to have later an "easier" life, a good job, good money and so on. This comes along with a commitment to school, to a fixed schedule, homework, competition with colleagues for "who's the best" and so on.First of all, the gypsies are refusing to let their own children in school. A friend of mine's mother is a school teacher. She told me that she had a gipsy girl in her class, but her parents didn't let her to study more than four years, claiming that for a girl, it's enough to be able to read and write. This tells a lot about their mentality. What kind of a job will her able to have later? What will she teach her children?3. WorkingThe normal expectation from an adult is to have a job, to keep it and to support his/her family with his partner. This comes with social security payments, retirement plan, insurances of all kinds, plan the children development, care about their education and so on.The gypsies, in their vast majority don't work (at least not with a contract). In Romania, they represent 10 or so from the population. I personally know only one (actually half gipsy) that had a good education and works just like any of us. I am able to bet 1000 EUR that more than 80 of the adult gypsies never worked a single day in their life (with a working contract). In the countryside sometimes they work the fields (one day deal with a farmer).So the question comes: if they don't work, how do they earn their living? Some of them have huge houses and yet they are illiterate. How is this possible?And the answer is very interesting.They somehow "sneak" along our society. Our very society that condemns me for writing this text.Stealing, begging networks, human trafficking, cheating are some of their major income sources.Let me explain.They are stealing by any thinkable and unthinkable methods. An example: they put a child in a big bag inside a bus along with the other luggage. The child got out, had plenty of time to search the other bags and upon arrival, he went back in his hiding place.There are small communities of gypsies in Romania that live at the edge of villages. Of course, they don't actually own land; they manage to survive by stealing from farmers. From time to time, the farms gather, burn some houses in revenge because they can't stand any more. The result: the farmers are facing charges of discrimination and have to pay money to the gypsies. The next day, the gypsies laughed at them. The victims are now happy that they will actually get money from the sufferings they endure.There is one place near Iasi called Podu Iloaiei, where there is a train station. It was quite \textbf{common} that the gypsies storm in the train, rob the passengers and leave. I don't know how it is today, but a few years ago at least it was like this.Lately, they make a living by selling \textbf{old} metals to recycling companies. So they take it from wherever: metal doors from buildings, steal \textbf{old} iron from the very storing area they re-sell it to. But worst, they sold as \textbf{old} metal bombs from WWII, they stole safety equipment from the railroad network and trains derailed because of this causing deaths and huge costs. They got the equivalent of a few EUR and in exchange people died and also made a hundreds of thousands EUR damage.Just to prove again (if needed) that they actually don't work, imagine that from time to time, one gets sick and goes to the hospital. All his/her relatives go to the hospital and stay there for hours in front, making noise, eating seeds and disturbing everybody around. If you see a big number of gypsies in front of a hospital, you can be sure that one of them is there.Begging networks.Don't be fooled by the poor \textbf{woman} with a child in the tram in Brussels (there I personally saw many beggars). Or the poor \textbf{old} lady at the corner saying she needs money to eat. They never actually worked and never will. YOU WORK FOR THEM. See the houses they built in Romania. Just google "palate tiganesti romania" and go to pictures.I personally saw deliberately crippled children begging (the worst was on the train Timisoara - Satu Mare, a girl having the knees turned 180 degrees. just horrible).Human traffickingThis is mainly done by gypsies and the \textbf{gypsy} women are not victims in this case. Read the book "Zu verkaufen: Mariana, 15 Jahre" wrote by Ianei Matei on this subject.CheatingThe best example is the "deal" made by the French authorities to pay some money if the return to Romania. They took the money, returned for a nice vacation paid by the French citizens and then they returned.They also claim they can put spells; they can "un-spell" a curse from you and so on. They can read the future and they can make anything if you just pay.5. Interacting to the "other" societyAlthough all the other points touched already this point, I would like to emphasize some other aspects. When it comes to physically interact with them, the things start going bad. If you have a Gipsy family in your neighborhood you'll know what I mean.In Timisoara, there were situations when such a family moved and the other families were "forced" to move out and to sell their apartments to other gypsies (at a "fair" price, of course). If your neighbors flood your apartment twice a week, have parties daily, ** on your door... you just move out.I saw once a thing that let me breathless: in the Timisoara city center, 10 meters away from the Opera House, a Gipsy \textbf{woman} pulled a bit her long skirt, spread the legs and pissed from standing position. It's a pedestrian area; it was summer, daylight... UNBELIVEBLE.A Hungarian TV crew wanted to make a show about a Gipsy village in Romania. They were surrounded and everything in their pockets was taken away. This is also shown on video. Later their local leader asked them to return everything and I believe they did it.Recently in Craiova a \textbf{woman} was hit by a car. \textbf{Nothing} special, except that all at a sudden some gypsies came up and took everything from poor \textbf{woman}'s purse as she was lying on the street. Can you imagine this? It's shown on video.I rest my case here.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Common, Communist, Gypsy, Nothing, Old, Transition, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Roma, Gender - General, Sexual Identity - Transexuality, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}18/1786 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.008 \\  \hline

India is the only non white \textbf{nation} to stand up to an imperial sovereign \textbf{nation} and fight for their independence, the English crown had no choice but to grant them , through Mahatma Ghandi's civil disobedience/refusal to work until independence was granted , caused the British to rethink their future strategy.

Dark skin was associated to all evils back then, and unfortunately it seems like it didn't change much . The gypsies were mistaken for egyptians whereas they never had anything to do with egypt excepted the fact that some \textbf{gypsy} group would have only crossed egypt to reach europe. And as well their worldview and their language ( which is recognized as of North \textbf{Indian} origin) was deemed as the devil's language by the then bigoted zealots , hence women were immediately judged as satanic witches and burnt along with \textbf{black} cats ; children were marked with an iron in the back so that they would be recognized as gypsies ( zingeur ) by locals ; and the Catholic leaders motivated everyone to harm any \textbf{gypsy} they met even with no reason just for being ethnically different ( to the extent ) using this \textbf{weird} law " Anyone who comes across a \textbf{gypsy} is allowed to kill off that satanic being lest he brings you his demons " .

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Hi I am from Slovakia and Gypsies them selves have no idea what they really are. One of the problems is communism that killed their original culture. They used to move all around and then after \textbf{communist} took over Czechoslovakia they could not anymore. They completely lost their identity. For instance when there were Sandokan movies they would name their sons Sandokan, then we got movies about Winnetou so they would name their sons Winnetou and daughters Ribana, some time ago we got popular Turkish soup opera Binbir Gece so we got bunch of little Onurs and Shehrezads running around. Oh and they bang their daughters. Incest is \textbf{nothing} for them. There is one village in Slovakia I can not find a name of it. In 1950 a one \textbf{Gypsy} family moved in. Now there are 1000 of them and they are all related.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small wow, i didnt know about that village. still sad gypsies had lost their identity. I think they deserve better. We had treated them like a scum for centuries, so now, lots of them behave like one. They are hostile to their surrounding, beause the surrounding has always been hostile to them.  I was so sad, when I first visited Romania and saw gypsies there. They are not like these in Slovakia (I am Slovak too, so I can compare), they have still their traditional clothes, horses and stuff, men wear huts and mustache, they play \textbf{gypsy} music on the streets... You can recognize them immediately. We were in Romania with our dog. So everytime me or my husband went to see some monument, while the other one stayed outside with pet and then we got changed. Once, I was waiting for husband and one \textbf{gypsy} \textbf{woman} came to me and told me I am beautiful. I had that big "\textbf{gypsy}" fake earrings and  boho skirt. It was still summer and hot, so I like this bohemian-hippie style full of colours. I gave her my earrings, because she really loved them and she almost cried that all white people only shoo her. We were talking little bit then about her life. She was speaking romanian and hungarian (and \textbf{gypsy} I presume). She said they had horses too and some family in Slovakia, Poland and Italy. In that moment, my husband was returning from the museum  and when he saw me with \textbf{gypsy}, he hurried to me asking if she robbed me. He said I need to check my stuff, if nothing¬¥s gone missing. But he was just paranoid. She was very nice \textbf{woman}, was not begging or something, just wanted to make small talk and wished me many children. We were just talking and my husband almost ran towards me horrified like if i was in danger...She didnt understand slovak, but she saw on my husbands face that horrified "OMG! a \textbf{gypsy}! hold your purse!" expression, so she left. I was feeling pretty bad for her until the rest of our holiday.  Although, I can count myself as minority too, I had never felt it so. This was the first time in my life, I started to think about what does it really mean to be a minority. When you are there alone and everyone hates you just because of who you are. Even if you dont beg, steal, or bang your sister, you are still hated \textbf{gypsy}. It must be horrible. You know, when some minorities shouts they are endangered and mistreated, usually it is just a propaganda and political bullshits. But gypsies are really mistreated and hated. Did you know that in Romania they were enslaved until 19th century? That time when there was ≈†tur and Sissi and Franz Jospeh...gypsies were slaves without basic human rights. Living and dying in horrible conditions. Their children would be sold, or killed like unwanted kittens or whatever. And no one has ever been punished for this. In Europe...On the borders of that time Austro-Hungary. And no one cared..No one cares now..We had never been taught about this in school. I dont know, that trip changed my thinking about gypsies. It is not just a phrase that they are endangered minority. I always thought they are screaming this, because they want more money. But they must just feel all that hatred towards them and that can cause particularly, how do they behave.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gypsy, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Roma, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}9/579 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.554 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small This is completely true. In Croatia your basic biggot thinks of everyone with a shade darker skin than a celt, german or slav as "a \textbf{gypsy}". Literally everyone, the world is divided into "obviously white people", "asians", "blacks" and "gypsies". That last group includes everyone from all of South America to non-\textbf{black} africans, the Mediterranean, Middle-East, India, and pretty much anyone in Europe with \textbf{black} hair. The problem is that they're completely unable to tell a "properly european looking" or a properly integrated Romani person from everyone else, so they only focus on the poor and the delinquents. And since the Roma know what Croats are like, when they have an establishment they do their best to hide the fact that it's run/staffed by gypsies. I've known virulent Roma haters who buy their daily bread and dairy products in a Roma bakery every day, and they had no idea WAS a Roma bakery, because all the counter staff were blond and pale skinned. But if you put Italians on the counter in a bakery, these same folks will think "it's a \textbf{gypsy} bakery, just look at them".

Your cousin who happens to have \textbf{black} hair? \textbf{GYPSY}!It's also the main "explanation" for anything anyone on the globe who isn't VERY CLEARLY white does. Someone in South America does something? "What do you expect, they're all gypsies." Someone in Serbia does something? "What do you expect from gypsies?" Someone in India does something? "They're gypsies, they don't know any better." There's rather good reason to believe there wasn't that much Nazi'sm around here as much as conviction that anoyne who looked even vaguely Mediterranean or Asian "was a \textbf{Gypsy} and thus up to no good". It's like, it's not that you like or trust blond people, or think much of them, but you're fairly certain that they're not Gypsies so they MIGHT be ok, and everyone else can't be ok because "they're gypsies". It's understandable when someone has actual bad experiences with actual gypsies (of which many are perfectly fine and integrated, but some really do live up to the stereotype), but the true extent of the \textbf{racism} towards gypsies becomes clear when you figure out that anyone at all who isn't very clearly white, and this means mostly very obviously slavic, celtic or germanic, is automatically written off as a "\textbf{gypsy}".Btw there are many shops owed and run by gypsies. What they do is that they put blonder, european looking folks on the counters, while they keep folks who look a shade more Mediterranean in the back. The customers generally have no idea that the, say, bakery is actually a \textbf{gypsy} bakery. But if you put, say, Italians on the counters, folks would hesitate to buy there because "that's a \textbf{gypsy} bakery". And there's actual trouble getting certain kinds of jobs for people who got \textbf{nothing} with gypsies but are just not slavic, celtic or germanic looking enough for other people in Croatia not to be afraid of them... in a country with the whole of the eastern adriatic coast in it, where a huge number of people look mediterranean.

Of course, coming from a family of poor farmers, she is not a wealthy \textbf{woman} herself, yet she is weak and 95 years \textbf{old}, which makes her a wonderful target for these people.She woke up while they were rummaging through her belongings, so she saw the faces of a man and a \textbf{woman}, seeing clearly who they were. In that moment they took a tissue dipped in some chemical agent, stuffed it onto her mouth and nose and knocked her unconscious. She woke up vomiting, with all the few valuables she had taken. The only gold she had were four medals of my deceased grandfather, one he received for surviving Mauthausen concentration camp, one he received when he was a partisan, and two for helping establishing a bank for poor farmers after the war. They even broke her ring finger, trying to rob her of her wedding ring, which she never took in almost seven decades.This all happened in broad daylight, in the countryside near Venice(IT). Of course two \textbf{gypsy} women came each day for two weeks to park their car near the house before that day, chatting with each other, studying the place.The result is a 95 year \textbf{old} \textbf{woman} in hospital for one month for the injuries, crying every day because she had some of the most touching mementos of the man she loved all her life taken away from her, all just because she is weak and those people can't be bothered to work to make money, everybody calling her "\textbf{racist}" because she doesn't pledge her everlasting love to them.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gypsy, Old, Racist, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - General, Ethnicity - Roma, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}7/304 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.303 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Good explanatory video, only a few remarks to add:1. I don't hate the Gypsies, I hate when the confusion is made between their new name and Romanians, the people of Romania, the country.2. The term Romani (with the accent on the final i, not as you used it in the video) is newly created. It is the political correct version of traditional names used by the rest of the world and themselves to designate Gypsies, Tzigoyner, Tsiganne, Zingaro or whatever people used to call them throughout Europe.3. It is the equivalent of "\textbf{African} American" or "Native American" introduced only decades ago in public vocabulary and later enforced by censors. Except, in real life, I have never met anyone, except the douche bags working in NGOs or politicians, to actually use this PC term. Not even Gypsies themselves use Romani to refer to themselves when talking to foreigners.4. It is true, that in their language they do use something that sounds like this. But that is from what I know derived from some Sanskrit word meaning "human" and "us  our \textbf{nation}". The word is something like "drom" and evolved into "rom".5. The name Romanian (in original, rom√¢n, with the plural ‚Äûrom√¢ni") on the other hand, referring to the inhabitants of Romania (Rom√¢nia) obviously comes from Rome and the ancient Roman Empire. The place was part of that empire and the language of the country is a Latin language, very much related with Italian, Spanish, French and Portuguese.6. Ethnically, the people of Romania and the Gypsies are also distinct. Romanians are white, European (ranging from a Mediterranean aspect with \textbf{black} hair and darker skin to white skin and blond hair, as numerous populations from Slavs to migratory tribes or settlers from distant parts of the empire were added to the mixture), while the Gypsies are of \textbf{Indian} origin (so typically have brownish skin).7. Why the Gypsies are also diverse in aspect has another explanation. In time, it became more of a social stigma, a class. So many from the lower ranks of society would join them in the way a young man from a decent family today would become a homeless for various reasons. So you would have European individuals who would become nomadic and live among Gypsies. Or marry with them. Thus the explanation of the few Gypsies with white skin, blue eyes and even blond hair. 8. As you point it out, in all countries, Gypsies are a slim minority. In Romania, according to official statistics, they make up 2.5 of the population. Indeed, they must be more than that, but not more than 5-10. Thus, it is unjust to maintain the confusion of Romania as "the country of the Gypsies", inaugurated some 20 years ago when the term Romani was adopted by European Union for Gypsies.9. It is interesting to note why there are many Gypsies in countries of East Europe. I heard a Gipsy saying this is an indicator of the tolerance of a country. Indeed, they are not an easy neighbor to have so I understand why many may not want them around. So the countries in which they are in small numbers are the ones that persecuted them the most. Thus the most \textbf{racist}, who now point their fingers to East Europe for having too many of them or for not integrating them properly. There is a big difference between Western types of organization and empires and the ones in the East. The Ottoman Empire, the Byzantine and the Tsarist Russian empire were all quite relaxed or incompetent in enforcing a single way of conduct. They could be violent at times, but in general let the societies bellow follow their own ways. Which was not the case with the Habsbourgs or the German administration, that was more rigorous in imposing their rules.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}African, Black, Indian, Nation, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Ethnicity - Native-American, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}5/645 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.775 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small DNA argument seems to me too close to \textbf{racism}. Races exist, but it's not all that matters, at least for me, not among the first. Humans are not just breeds of dogs or other animals to be defined in such a simplistic way. Culture is far more important, religion, language, education, personal qualities, upbringing and so on. The problem with the Gypsies is not that they come from outside Europe, is that some of them did not adhere to the European culture and way of life in the last thousand years. If they did, no one would care.Trying to remake the genealogy of a person based on genes is based too much on speculations. They say that going back a millennium would give a person something like 100.000 ancestors. What difference does it make if one of those is Alexander the Great? Though it would be cool to present yourself as his grand-grand....son. Or, let's say they find out a Persian gene in you. It would make a difference if that comes from a king or his slave, but the gene would not show it. Einstein and the \textbf{woman} who was doing his laundry had probably the same marker of origin. It's like with those who pretend to have lived other lives - they are always Cleopatra, Caesar, never some low life in their stories.And what would the "European" marker indicate? A Bulgarian is not the same as a Portuguese. But many of the peoples of Europe came from Asia. If the Huns came in the 4th century, a Hungarian today would have similar indicators as someone who just moved in the 19th century to UK from Azerbaidjan and mixed with locals. But they are culturally worlds apart.  Many people will say, OK, but it's the overall percentage that matters. Well, they say we have over 90 \textbf{common} genes with some animals, but the small part makes a whole difference.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Common, Racism, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General, Gender - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}3/322 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.932 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Portruguese \textbf{gypsy} data for you: Brazilian gypsies that kept being \textbf{gypsy}, which may be rare, they have an accent that mix Portuguese \textbf{gypsy} accent with the general Brazilian accent, which is funny if you know both, but generally speaking they retained the typical \textbf{gypsy} enfasis of the last syllabe in a given word or sentence. So, it seems a whole new accent. They may have been sent to Brazil as a Portuguese policy, which may explain why the Portuguese community is small, unlike Spain's. \textbf{Gypsy} accent in Portugal is very close to the southern Portuguese accent, even if there are gypsies communities in the North, their accent is quite distinct from Northern Portuguese, as they retain southern Portuguese features.Gypsies in Portugal often speak Portuguese, some do speak Calo, but very rare, most of those who do come from Spain, and mix Portuguese-Spanish while speaking with us. Their religion is Christian, but  not  Catholic... some Portuguese gypsies for integration, have done some religious rituals in the streets for Portuguese to see... it is more like an evangelic sect, not Catholic at all. But Christian... yes. The rituals (singing in a cycle) are typically done at a house, choosen by a group of related gypsies.Romanian gypsies which we now have are very different from portuguese ones in EVERYTHING... culture, looks, dressing and behavior, not the same people, so we consider them Romanians, at most Romanian \textbf{gypsy} (rare), but never just "\textbf{gypsy}". Portuguese gypsies are only known as \textbf{gypsy} (cigano), per self identification and also slur, Roma is the capital city of Italy and of the former Roman empire. So it is never used by the gypsies themselves or the Portuguese. Portuguese gypsies work in free fairs (typical ancient fairs in Portugal, most \textbf{common} for them), live off wellfare or shoplifting, in fact, recently a shoftlift went viral, because trhey tend to be aggressive and use their minority issue for protection from the police or store security guards, but not all gypsies do shoplifting.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Common, Gypsy & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Roma, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}9/333 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.703 \\  \hline

You called me Hitler but he killed millions of Roma many of the comments agree with him as well so it is obvious who the Nazis are.

I guess it's because they thought the Roma were nomadic and migrated to "other people's homelands" like the Jews and they may have believed the Roma were of Egyptian instead of North Indian/Aryan origin like how people used to believe of the Roma. The Nazis also believed oddly enough that the Native Americans were prime Aryans somehow, and some neo-Nazis and/or Himmler had bizarre mythology about aliens visiting the ancient Aryans and them founding the long lost Atlantis.

Ah fuck i sense this be a fun convo here.The Hungarian girl you're pretty to me and smart but don't forget that we all came to Europe besides the Neanderthals were in Europe first before us Homo sapiens.  (Neanderthals  are not part of our species, not even subspecie.)Get back to the point i am trying to make is that we homo sapiens about 200k years ago all came from south africa to the rest of the world.So you are arguing over who is European i get your point well to stay on topic the Romanians just what the fuck is a romanian? Mayars i know Hungary's population but Romanian population well we can look and find out.Well what i found out is that the Romanians have \textbf{nothing} to do with Gypysies so okay what is the problem here?  In the Czech Republic they the Gypysies think and say they are Roma as from Romania which they are Not! The Romanains meaning latinized people in that given region and \textbf{nothing} more!The gypysies come from India or where the fuck they come from all i know. Maybe some one tell me where do Gypysies come from?Mars? lolAlright so Romani people come from India and have \textbf{nothing} to do with Romania which they try to say they have a national state that is Romania which is not true.Romani people in Romania. Romani people (Roma in Romani; »öigani in Romanian) in Romania, \textbf{Gypsy}, constitute one of the country's largest minorities. According to the 2011 census, they number 621.573 people or 3 of the total population, being the second \textbf{ethnic} minority in Romania.So the Romani ehtnicity has \textbf{nothing} to do with the Romanian People. Good fucking riddaince.Where are Romanian people from?One, known as the Daco-Roman continuity theory, posits that they are descendants of Romans and Romanized indigenous peoples living in the Roman Province of Dacia, while the other posits that the Romanians are descendants of Romans and Romanized indigenous populations of the former Roman provinces of Illyria, Moesia, ...What was Romania called before it was Romania?Antiquity. Ancient Romania was inhabited by Thracian tribes. The Greeks called them the Getae, the Romans called them Dacians, but they were actually a single Geto-Dacian people.Why is it called Romania?The name of Romania (Rom√¢nia) comes from the Romanian Rom√¢n, which is a derivative of the Latin adjective Romanus (Roman). Romanians are a people living in Central and South-Eastern Europe speaking a Romance language.Are Romanians and Romans the same?The theory of Daco-Roman continuity argues that the Romanians are mainly descended from the Daco-Romans, a people developing through the cohabitation of the native Dacians and the Roman colonists in the province of Dacia Traiana (primarily in present-day Romania) north of the river Danube.What is the \textbf{ethnic} group of Romania?About 89.4 of the people of Romania are \textbf{ethnic} Romanians, whose language, Romanian, is an Eastern Romance language, descended from Latin with some Bulgarian, Serbian, German, Greek, Hungarian and Turkish borrowings.So the Roamanians are not Romans but got Romanized fuck! The Romanians are not Romani People FUck!!!Geto-Dacian are not romani and it is a misuse of the english language and other languages that is all a stereotype thinking created by simple-minded people who lack the education or were mis lad by the whole Ramani community to whites thinking that Romani ah so Romania. Hahahahhaa no and again no.By the way the reason why the Romani who came from India and who they got words similar is because the Greeks were there and taught them Greek and yes Greek was before Latin as we know it nowdays.Maybe that is why the Romani and stop calling them gypsies as that was from Europeans thinking they came from Egypt and just like whites thinking that they were in India but were in Americas and called them the natives indians.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I need to point out though, Mason, that a direct and unquestionable link between the Irish Travellers and the India-derived Gypsies has yet to be established. Which is of course not easy seeing as they are both groups that are not particularly willing to participate in any sort of genetic research. But from what we now know, the ITs are almost undistinguishable from the indigenous Irish, they are also of predominantly Celtic stock. In fact, just googling their pictures tells you as much: remove the \textbf{tacky} tracksuits and fancy dresses, replace them with some regular clothing of an average middle-class Dublin family and \textbf{nobody} would know any better. It's also important to remember that the ITs have been attested in Ireland as early as the 1300s, which is some 300 years before the India-Gypsy migration to the British Isles.Now granted, their vocabulary is in some 10 of Romani origin, however the most plausible explanation would be that the India-Gypsies simply assimilated into a greater Celtic IT community and that's the reason for the numerous Romani loanwords in their language.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nobody, Tacky & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}2/180 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.111 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small 1:27 As a matter of fact, we know for certain it was the Gypsies who antagonized their European hosts first. This is evident in written records: at first the Gypsies were perceived as a colorful minority, they were often invited to play music at weddings and even engage in fortune telling for the blast of it. But when people caught on to the fact that their purses tended to mysteriously disappear after encountering the Gypsies and that trying to confront them about it would usually end in tears, well, that's when the persecution started.It's similar to the Jews. They were liked at first, \textbf{nobody} gave a damn abot the fact that they had Jesus killed or anything. It was after they made a name for themselves as shark loans as well as collaborationists (the local Jews were instrumental in the swift Muslim conquest of the erstwhile Christian Levant, North Africa, Iberia and Anatolia) that they began to be hated with a passion by the general populace.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nobody & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!27}1/167 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.599 \\  \hline

Only problem is, when an average Christian in Al-Andalus knew one Christian who collaborated with the Muslims, he also knew ten others who did not. With Jews on the other hand, basically all of them were at the very least sympathetic to the Muslims. That's why they were kicked out in 1492. I mean, what were they expecting? That the Christians would be pretending like \textbf{nothing} was the matter?The same goes with the Gypsies. They weren't the only group who engaged in stealing.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The situation in Bulgaria is basically the same as everywhere on the Balkans but in some aspects it's much worse. In particular, there is a significant number of municipalities in the country where the population has dwindled significantly over the past few decades due to mass emigration and economic decline. The demographical gap created by these negative processes was filled up mainly by RABBITly growing \textbf{Gypsy} communities. Unfortunately, thanks to their breeding habits, they have severely outnumbered the locals in many places. The locals, who are predominantly \textbf{elderly} people, suffer daily from criminal atrocities perpetrated by members of the so-called "Romani tribe" - mainly burglaries, which, at times, result in violent beatings of \textbf{old} men and women, who initially refused to let go of their money and other valuables willingly. Moreover, this situation has turned into a never-ending nightmare for the aged inhabitants, since almost none of them have  nearby any younger relatives to rely on, and the number of policemen, assigned to patrol around the villages, is highly insufficient. So, tell me, please, how is it possible not to harbour a certain degree of animosity towards the \textbf{ethnic} group in question?

Jews were also excluded from the native societies.  But unlike Gypsies , they didn't resort to stealing and prostitution becasue their religion deemed those acts as sin. Jews were also banned to work  in traditional professions like bricklaying, ironworking, blacksmiting, carpentry...in some parts of Europe.  As a result of this, they exceled in trade and became wealthier . In 19th and 20th century, it also caused them to go to universities in high numbers and became lawyer, doctor,architect and \textbf{engineers}.

It's Gypsies who should do some steps to improve relations between them and others. White majority already did a lot of steps - for example, Gypsies are getting houses for free, but Gypsies destroy them in a few years, sell all metallic furnishings and then they demand a new house for free, because the \textbf{old} house they already destroyed.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Lampavaja Nyasha in fact the Romanian culture is the opposite of the Roma culture  . Eg.  In the past when Roma people were marring the \textbf{woman} didn't need a certain inheritance to marry. Usually in the \textbf{Indian} culture the man has to pay for the wife and take her to his home to live with his family.  Same for Roma people. The Romanian wedding was exactly the opposite, the \textbf{woman} was purchasing the man by using her inheritance.  There is a special name for it. Also Romanians have a novel about a peasant who marries a \textbf{woman} for financial reasons. It is named "Ion" by Liviu Rebreanu. One century ago women had to give land , properties or to work if they had no family to marry  ( except if an idiot believed in true love and accepted a poor \textbf{woman}). Usually the \textbf{woman} was the provider of the materials for the building of a house. The man bulids the house using the \textbf{woman}'s land and resources such as wood. The \textbf{woman} and the man are working and used to work together" elbow to elbow " according to the \textbf{old} newspapers and documents such as foreigners diaries or journals. They left the family.  Usually when a peasant was marring he was sending another peasant with the food cooked by his parents a bottle of the stongest alcoholic beverages  ( named" Palinka ", a kind of "Vodka "but made of fruits) , the peasant had to wear traditional clothes and hold the national flag.  He was riding the horse until he reached the \textbf{woman} 's house. She had to send the same person later with the answer.   Women got more respect, freedom and responsabilities in the past in the Romanian culture . Women had the right to work as tailors or in the literature domain , they were allowed to work in publishing houses , be actresses or singers, work as translators or even \textbf{doctors} before the 2nd world war.  They weren't allowed by society usually to join the army  ( except  for Andreea Zaharia the Soldier from Marasesti) to own big businesses in rural areas.    However in the Romanian culture the \textbf{woman} purchases the man while in Roma people's culture the man purchases the \textbf{woman}. In their culture the \textbf{woman} is promised when she is 12 to marry for financial reasons.  She is sold at a young \textbf{age} by her family.  She has to wake up at 5 o clock cook and wash clothes she is not allowed to travel socially speaking or to study.  In the case of Romanians, to avoid the school was illegal. 4 classes were mandatory starting with 1864. Before 1864 people born in the  working class, few peasants and  all of the noble people used to go to school. Noble people had private teachers. Gypsies had no school. Even nowadays their culture opposes  the Romanian one when it comes to moral values,  philosophy and the activities resulted from the  past experiences. When Muslims attacked Indians they run away to Europe while Romanians struggled fighting. If they were like gypsies Romania had been a part of the Hungarian kingdom or republique nowadays. However the East of Romania was made by Hungarians. The biggest difference is made by peasants who preferred to die poor in the village while gypsies where travelling day by day,  they used to live in tents.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Indian, Old, Woman, doctors & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - Native-American, Gender - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}14/563 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.487 \\  \hline

I come from the state of Punjab in India and we certainly do not buy the girls as you say. You are confusing us with Islamic nations because you are so secluded in your knowledge of the world. In most parts of India the parents of the girls have to pay a dowry which is money, gold, and other resources to the boy upon marriage not the other way around as you are saying. Secondly Indians don't run when an enemy comes to our door step. Alexander the Greats Empire ended on the western front of the \textbf{Indian} subcontinent at the Bias River and there was a reason for that. He knew if he went forth it would be the end of him. Your historians write differently that he was tired of conquering but the fact is he retreated from that land and ran back to where he came from. A man who had conquered the most powerful rule in all of Europe and then further conquered the Persians all the way to the edges of India and runs back from the people you try to call fearful(\textbf{Indian}). We have fought many wars, lost many and won many over the years as all nations have. At a certain point we were the richest \textbf{nation} on the planet and for a long time indeed that was the reason why Alexander and later the British and the rest of Europeans where trying to find their way to us, to loot us. At that time your nations were poor and desolate. Now that your nations have some wealth you seem to question us and who we are with your misinformation.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Aromanians speak a dialect of Romanian that is over 95 mutually intelligible in written form with Romanian (about 80 during speech because of the accent difference). So, no, they can't be different people. Also in Greece they call Aromanians "Vlahii ; Mavrovlahii or Cutsovlahii'' , so it's self explanatory. If they where Illyrians then they would have developed a  language breaking away directly from Vulgar Latin rather than Romanian and it would have resembled the Dalmatian language. Also, Aromanian only has negligible Slavic words , so no slavic connection there. Actually, in Romania we say that Aromanian is Romanian without the Slavic words (10 Slavic vocabulary in Romanian (less than 5 in modern speech) and less than 2 in Aromanian). They are the descendants or Romanian shepherds seasonally migrating with their flock throughout the Balkans, most of which eventually abandoned the trade and settled down in other Ottoman-controlled territories in Europe . It's true, though, that phenotypically they resemble more with Greeks than Romanians. Another group of people are the Istro-Romanians, they also inhabit ancient-Illyrian lands, now part of Croatia. Their origin is well known, they are farmer-migrants from Banat region of South-West Romania who settled in the Istrian peninsula in 2 waves, the first around 900 A.D. attested by works of Emperor Constantine VII and a second larger wave after the \textbf{Black} Death wiped out many inhabitants of the area in the 1300 A.D. This dialect has many Slavic words in it's vocabulary and is also the farthest-away from modern Romanian, due to it's speakers being isolated from other Romanian speakers throughout the centuries. Due to their much smaller numbers and isolation they have mixed with Slavs profusely and are nowalmost extinct.  It's debatable whether or not it's a dialect or a different language, but both Romanian and Croatian authorities consider it to be a variant of Romanian.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!5}1/309 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.324 \\  \hline

Beside of some salty kids, \textbf{nobody} in Romania care if Americans or the Englishmen can or not make the difference. And their native \textbf{Gypsy}  word(  Rom and Roma(plural) ) for man was known by Romanians,  and was known that was used by the Englishmen in the form Romani or Roma for the \textbf{Gypsy} \textbf{nation} of England, but \textbf{nobody} expected that idiots who cannot make a difference and hateful ignorant scums from other countries  will have the power to write  and spread their no brain conclusions in English.  Probably the English elite will had changed the name for the Gypsies. if that was a problem back then.You see, idiots and hateful  scums had no power back then, but internet allowed every idiot to have the same power or even more than a man with Ph D.   Also,  Romanians changed no name, just the letter U or √Ç to O.  So Rum√¢n or R√¢m√¢n becomed Rom√¢n, as in the medieval times('Then why you not use your original mediiaeval name')How ironic, I told you, idiots have the honor to spread their empty head ideas everywhere! Take your example, without knowing that, you just blamed us for not using what we use! :)) No, foul, beside reverting to the  medieval version, we did not changed a thing in our name, your problem is with you. You changed the way you call us, from Olah, Olahok to Roman and Romanok!   You can call us Olahok, Rumanok or Romanok, we  not give a cent.

It's easy, the same applies for all the Slavs and for the Germanic people!  And Vlachs also means Romans or Romance, for example in medieval times in Poland Romanians wore called Wo≈Çosi, and even today Italians are called W≈Çosi!!! It's means the same thing as Romanian or Roman, the native name, the French of Belgium are called Walloons, being Romance.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small +Pericolo L.A. In fact Istro-Romanians, Aromanians are more related to Romanians of Transylvania, Banat, Maramuresh and Moldova than to Megleno-Romanians and Romanians of Southern Transylvania, Oltenia, and Muntenia in some aspects like words taken from vulgar Latin. Also, Romanians of Maramuresh, Northern and Central Transylvania , Banat and Moldova are more related to Aromanians than to Romanians from Oltenia and  Muntenia and Southern Transylvania, even if the language had evolved and we understand more better the last ones. I think there wore some differences between regions of Roman Empire in terms of natives, Getae and Thracians of the East and Dacians and Dardanians of the west. when they took the language,  different sources and the time they took it.For example the east(not including Moldovans who are in fact western Romanians from Maramuresh) say 'varzƒÉ' to cabbage, while the west or the north say curechi, curet'i. From that we can see the western part, Dacians and Dardanians took Latin more early then the East, Getae and Thracians, because varzƒÉ comes from green 'viridis'-'vir(i)dia' who  had the meaning of cabbage a bit latter, while curechi from vulgar  coliculus from classical   cauliculus  was the word for cabbage as a base (l-r shift,  drop of the termination , change of i to e will give an early curecu in western Romanian,  who would palatalize c   and would force u to drop and will make C to sound t' or chi having today curechi(more fluent) and curet'i more \textbf{old}.But is good to know that dialects of the Romanian, North and South of Danube,  appeared late in the game, before that there wore just some minor difference in terms of vocabulary like the one mentioned above and some verbs from region to regions, but wore no difference in the shape and pronunciation. So there was no difference in the form of the words like today.  Picior was picior in all  Romanian, but palatalization in the west was more strong than in the east, maybe because the west was mixed with Illyrians in Dardania and Dacia had tons of Illyrian and Pannonian colonists (we see this to our extinct relatives, the Dalmatians, who  wore Illyrians  and had even more consonants palatalized than us, so  we must conclude that is and Illyrian feature) so picior becomed pt'icior(today Maramuresh), then P dropped in XVII century because of use and t shifted to C or ch(\textbf{common} to Romanian) in Moldova and in Aromanian lands. Also Ar√¢m√¢n is not native name, the native form was R√¢m√¢n.So the statement that  Aromanians are not Romanians can come only from an ignorant of Romanian language and culture. So yes,  at the core, Romanians split in two,  the western branch, who are the heirs of Dardanians and Dacians,  and the east branch,  who are the heirs of Tharcians and Getae. And this is not necessary a \textbf{ethnic} split of the natives(because Dacians and Getae  wore one and the same people(in South Danube both wore called Moesians), maximum they spoke different dialects because  Dacians wore Getae influenced by Pannonian dialect of the Illyrian language, and Dardanians wore Tharacians and Dacians influenced by Illyrian language, but is a split because of the spread from west to east of the Latin language who took some time and needed to cross the Carpathians and Haemus and Rila mountains.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Common, Ethnic, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}3/552 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.543 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small +Romberto Agnello Oh boy, the circle of madness is never ending. There is no shame, no research, only Hungarians, Bulgarians and now you, an Italian talking stupid things. First of all, you had lots of romance languages and former nations inside your borders, so of course for you reality and languages are not important, because your country is made ignoring that, and reverting to a past where Italians wore all Romans, so united.  No problem for me, but is good to see where your bias comes from.  Italy is more of a concept, is like we would be calling ourselves Dacians(some mad idiots do that and are the laughing stoke of Romanian society)For us the language was the driving force, and is the only true base for a \textbf{nation}. Civic nations(like Italy, UK Spain, France are based on borders or utopias and are less strong in terms of unity. Well, France is  strong, having less separatists, almost none, while Spain is on fire). Blood nations do not exist, because there are no pure nations, so language is very important. Now, you are wrong in every aspect, you are dead wrong. 1. Romanians are almost the only romance people who preserved the name, the only big Romance \textbf{nation}.2. Romanians have more or the same cultural ties with Rome than any other former Romans. Some of them: Like eating \textbf{fat} pig like the roman legions on a daily bases,  considering the beard a primitive custom, preserving Saturnalia customs like sacrificing the \textbf{pigs} on 20 Dec, almost the whole Romanian Christmas is  a copy of Saturnalia,  the new year celebration with popular songs remembering Trajan(plowing the field of Dacia), pastoral traditions etc. 3. Romanian Language formed from 28 BC Conquest of Moesia(46 Thrace, 101 South Decebal's Dacia, 106 North of Decebal's Dacia) to 615 when most of the Romance regions wore burned to the ground by Slavs, because of  Pochas being stupid in 605, to  620 when Heraclius changes the language of the Empire to Greek because of this disaster.   Romanian language is not formed only in Dacia(271-101=170, not 100 years), the language shows clear sings that till VII century she got Latin trends related to the empire. This showcasing of the North Romanian dialects is today  a thing because Romania got Independence and the Romanians of Dacia are the only Romans who expanded across the \textbf{old} border of the Roman Empire, after it's collapse! Maramuresh, Bereg, Moldova, Muntenia, Transnistria wore not so much in the Roman Empire, so we are the most potent Romans on our own, in Europe.  Spain, Portugal and France had colonies and empires, but fighting Avars, Slavs, Mongols, Magyars and Turks is one thing, fighting savages with stone arrows is another. :But ignoring our history south of Danube is madness. Romanians are the last Romans speaking Latin who wore part of the Empire.  So not 100, not 170, but 648 years of Roman history! More than Milano  and Cisalpine Gaul(the core of modern Italy), who would add only 533 years under the Romans!!!Emperors like Galerius, Regalianus,  Justinian wore proto-romanians.  4. The language was never more Slavic or had  a huge proportion of Slavic. We took French and Italian words in terms of academic Romanian, but before that we took Slavic  words to, in terms of academic Romanian, because of the Slavonic  being Lingua Franka,  just a century before  \textbf{nationalism}. Words like drum/road, pod/bridge(we had  and still have 'cale' who is a Latin inherited word for road, just is not used by the Government,  we had and still have punte for bridge, well now it means small bridge, and we use the modern Slavic loan ). Taking words from Lingua Franka languages is \textbf{common}, now everyone imports from English. Slavic words are 14  of the language,  more that in XX century, 11. In Republic of Moldova, where the language was more influenced by Slavic languages, only 20 of the rural language is Slavic!From 20 in the area where Russians practically made a Genocide against Romanians, to more than 50 is a long road and huge madman claim! But Vocabulary  is not even important, but the phonetics, grammar and the verbs. In Romanian are 100 Latin. In terms of vocabulary, Magyar is more Slavic than the Romanian language is, 20 of the language being Slavic, and is not an Uralic language because only 21 of the vocabulary is Uralic. But, of course, what matter is the Uralic grammar! Also Farsi has more Arabic vocabulary than Persian, but is an Indo-European language, also English has more romance vocabulary, but is Germanic. (Of course some parts of Italy would have more words from Latin, being almost a property of the Vatican for years! While Romanians had to deal with all kind of invaders and hordes.)  Also, Romanian is the ONLY romance language who has elements from the classical language and also from the late Empire.  So it shows we are quite the Romans. Example of classical imputCLASSIC LATIN----------ROMANIAN----------VULGAR LATIN------- Casa matris meae-----Casa mamei mele-----casa de matre meae---- Example of late influence. The term for church in Romanian, and only in Romanian, is bisericƒÉ, from basilica(Basilicas wore a trend in the times of Justinian)  So, in conclusion, you are just a butt hurt Italian, mad that we preserved the name of the Empire and of the \textbf{nation}, or a madman who do not knows a thing but likes to ramble. In the first Romanian preserved writhing, 175 of 190 words, not counting repetition, wore Latin words.

Also, I would not blame only the Gypsies for our poor image, like the fascist Romanians do.  After Romania was ransacked by USSR to the bone and was subjected to the  1980 collapse, stealing from the state meant surviving.  So maybe Romanian workers in factories did not had the same culture as the ones in the west when they went to work.

And maybe in some parts of Bereg and Maramuresh  wore at 30 in the past(XX century, we talk about the vulgar Romanian and is hard to guess,  and  that is an obscene maximum)  because of the assimilation process started by the Ukrainian Orthodox Church United with Rome in XVII century inside Bereg and Maramuresh, from Muncacevo. Ukrainians wore,  let's say easy to be ruled by Hungarians and Austrians, and wore more privileged in some terms. While Romanians of Maramures and Bereg had a longer history of resistance and wore mostly nobles with lands, and ties to Moldova, so more dangerous. But in rest of Romania it's not the same and at best the number of words was between 15 and 9 in any given \textbf{age}.  2. What  are you speaking about?  When the Romanian Government had a policy to make the language more Romance?  Tell me the law! How to not be insulted when,  without any clue about my \textbf{nation}, you are  talking like a Ph. D graduate? In the last post you said Romanian is a Slavic language, now that our Government had a law to make the language more romance.  Who does that? What is the truth!? Of course, in the Romanian language entered lots of words starting with XVI century due to large improvements in European life style and culture, as today from English, because our culture stagnated after the Huns,  Avars burned all to the ground, then the Slavs, then the Magyars, then the Mongols, then Turks(try to burn your home down every 5-20 years. See where you will get in terms of culture and wealth, not counting human losses and robbery) From XVI to XVIII century, Slavic loans wore the most \textbf{common}, from XVIII century in Transylvania the elite starts to build the national idea,  \textbf{nationalism} starts to take shape influenced by German thinking, so science and all sorts of writings had a boom! And of course, being most of them clergy and people from Transylvania, the elites  loaned words from monastic  Latin  used in those days in science and terminology of any kind! Note 1: the language of the people did not get the loans by that date in all Romanian lands,  the loans from Slavic continued. Note 2: In Transylvania, in this \textbf{age} of progress, the vulgar  language  starts to  be influenced  by Hungarian, so only the language of the elites and the books receive loans from Latin.  Loans from the Hungarian language start to replace or be used side by side with native Latin and Slavic words. Like the word 'mƒÉrhaie'-cow, who comes from the Hungarian word for goods put to sell, side by side with 'vacƒÉ', the native Latin word from vacca.  Then the idea of \textbf{nationalism} passed into the south and east, to Moldavians, Wallachians and Aromanians, and by then lots of people started to learn in France, learned about the Italian Renaissance and started to travel and study more and more, so a fuck ton of French and Italian, beside Latin words entered in science and the academic language, replacing even Latin original words! Like \textbf{mental}(from french) vs mintal(native), like ochiular (native) vs ocular(from french)!  French and Italian wore languages for study, France was the pinnacle of cultural cool (even German Kings wore keen to spoke in French)!  So accusing the Romanian Government that people liked French, is just stupid, at best.  For Is like accusing the Romanian state that I spoke to you in English and I say to my device, ' laptop', not some Romanian word like 'ma≈üinƒÉ de calcul, (loans from german and french both) or socotitoare (romanian from a loaned slavic word) or drƒÉcie cu lumini(inherited)'!   Yes, we must conclude, the Romanian government wants to make  our language more English!!! Maybe the Jews!? :)) There wore jokes about that in the \textbf{age},  and even plays, how people prefer French over Romanian! Read about Romanian culture before pulling facts out of your ass!  We have comedy based on that. Search Caragiale!Yes, there was a bias towards Slavs in the late years, due to Relations with Russia, and because we are at base romance, but that was a late thing, not a policy and I don't even know if it had any meaning in terms of language! Maybe that made people to avoid Russian or Slavic languages, and made us feel somehow superior, but how is the Government blamed for this? Even now we are very anti-russian. 3. What the hell is wrong to have Slavic words in Romanian(Hungarians have more, just saying, because I see you received likes from the Nazis of Hungary), and why is wrong to replace them if they are not needed anymore(most wore not are not replaced)? Are you a \textbf{nazi} like the Hungarians of Jobbik, and you consider the Slavs inferiors ? (By the way, they consider that, while they call the Polish people brothers. Just to see how stupid the neo-nazism  reached.) So, we, having contacts with the Slavs, are somehow inferior?   For fucking sake, of course we have Slavic influences,  and we are Slavs too, we wore fighting them or be friends with them(mostly with the Bulgarians and Ukrainians  we had good ties in some parts of our history) for over 1500 years! But do not means we are not Romans at origin and we are lesser Romans than some, in general.  When you review the enemies we had, you see how  Romans we are, surviving this mess, even without looking at the culture! To conclude  There are no pure races, and I don't see how being Slavs too, makes us lesser Romans.  At the base of the Romanian culture is the Roman culture and the Latin language! Like every culture, we do not live in caves and we do not inbreed like the Habsburgs  did(because we are still here, unlike them), so we have ties to the cultures of the area!

You talk to others, to "be a man", and the criteria you give:"you will be man if you accept everything what I saying". This is ridiculous man, you need psychiatrist or something, but I dont want to personalize to you this style, because this behaviour very general on the Balkans. I understand, why you not like Europe and love more USA. But the reason is nicely visible in this article: [LINK] So not hate yourself, even not on undermind way - and the world will slowly starting to accept you.

I just said that a language doesn't indicate a culture totally. Before you had more slavic words (this is a fact). You even got German words and Greek words that doesn't mean you're german (even if there are a lot of germans in Romania). Personally I know a lot of Romanians here in Italy (there are 2 millions of Romanians) and they all hate Hungarians even if they're in part.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small +Roberto Agnello  Well, if you insist, i should respond!  Is not the same thing, and probably for you is not a big deal to talk about invented languages and conspiracies, but some Hungarian nuts, Bulgarian nuts,  Russian nuts and Romanian nuts might believe you. You see, in the middle of Europe, not Mediterana, this concepts killed tens of millions. (Still kill in Donets and Lugansk)  You clearly do not read my texts, I do not visit Europe, I will not visit Italy, and I consider Romanians, who say we are not guilty in part for how people see us, as unrealistic. Romanians had and have more bad morals than most of EU, have a complex culture, but inferior in terms of philosophy, in comparison to USA and UK,  due to clear factors.  The texts are above. Sorry, you have one problem with your 'you are mad for \textbf{nothing}', the texts are there. Quote'For example Romanian has been latinized about 100 years a go. It was a mixture between slavic and romance language (more slavic)' It's \textbf{black} on white, Romanian is an artificial language who was more Slavic than Latin in the past! You said that! Is there. Then you said that the Government had something to do with it, of course!  So that is history revisionism. You know, like ‚ÄûUkraine is an artificial fascist \textbf{nation}, who stole her lands from Russia, Hungary, Poland and Romania, so let's bring 'democracy' with green mercenaries and covert missions and conquer Ukraine'  So my posts are on point! For your Romanian culture,  the only policy in this mater was the national-socialist policy in the times of Ceau≈üescu, who was totally against Rome!  I bet all the bogans from Romania will tell you they are Dacians and Latin was some fake Dacian!  Just visit any pub and ask! :)) And just one problem, the Slav words are in the same number, just they have a smaller proportion, they are in DEX all of them, so they are counted.  By the way, I do not see myself as a roman in terms of blood and politics, because Rome is dead and there was no pure blooded Rome, to begin, but in terms of culture I am a roman by extent, I like it, or not!   Why? Simple, because Rome was never about blood, in most cases, because Rome formed a \textbf{nation} and was the only \textbf{nation} till 1848, because I know for sure that the language we have  is there because we wore part of the \textbf{nation}, and  most of the Roman lands still speak Latin in an evolved stage, some who did not had Empires and Medieval states favorable, still preserve the name(we, the ones from the Alps, the Greeks).  It matters less if my Ancestors wore Slavic warlords or Cuman mercenaries, or Roman Consuls, or Dacian sicari, because culture has \textbf{nothing} to do with the blood, and they already decided to adopt the culture I have, who is Roman at the base! Who am I to take a DNA test and then to say, wait, I am more 'Celtic' because I have R1b, so I am French! :)) Has no sense! So from this aspect,  I am Romanian and by extent Roman.  This is the whole point of the Romanians feeling Romans.  It's not like we have some Make Romania Empire Great again movement, like the panslavic one!  I think this was the point of  Romanity to begin with. So that will be the answer. You don't know the area and what your words had provoked in this savage corner of Europe.  In Italy even the fascism looked like a good Russian democracy! :))-------- Hungarians?We wore by our will  just part of the Kingdom of Hungary, that died with the Arpad line, and at Mohacs , It's remains wore just a ghost on a map, transformed and warped by leaders from Poland, Germany , Transylvania and the Catholic Church in something who collapsed step by step!  So I do not  know  why I would consider myself Hungarian.  In the Kingdom of Hungary, my ancestors wore called Olahi, not Hungarians. Quotte ‚ÄûIohannes filius Ige voyvoda Olacorum de Maramoros'  Ige=Iuga, olacorum=romanian, voyvoda= military leader and duke, even prince(Domn) in our culture (This is from a XIV century Hungarian diploma, as Maramuresh was a vassal political entity inside the Kingdom untill XV century) Then the Hungarian \textbf{nation} formed  influenced by Transylvanian feudalism and religious infighting between Rome and Constantinople, so that was the end of the somehow multicultural Magyar Kaghanate of Arpad, the end of my people noble rights and the start of reverting to dark \textbf{age}, famine, isolation and savageness(Well, in Transylvania started earlier, but in Maramuresh after 1848). Then all this transformed in civil wars. So it has no sense at all for me to consider myself Hungarian, we never formed a \textbf{nation}, and the forming of their \textbf{nation} was not happy for us. The last war my ancestors fought for the 'de facto' Kingdom of Hungary, by will , was against the Austrians,  with R√°k√≥czi. But that just fucked up Maramuresh, all the churches and most of the homes wore burned by Ukrainians serfs paid by Austria, while fighting in other areas. And  from that point Romanians will be the bad guys and a minority with the time in Maramuresh!  (Now some fascist from Hungary even accuse us that our churches are not older than XVIII century. ) But I respect Hungarians, most of them who I know in real life I consider my friends.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Black, Nation, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}10/924 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.082 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Well, I'm a Hungarian Rom (natural born citizen of Hungary and all), and as a Roma person, I can tell you that we Romani are indeed White; like, we are significantly European. Many of us are between 25 and 75 "White European," and this all goes back about approximately 800 years of our 1,200 years in Europe. That being said, I would love for you to try to tell a Romanichal, Welsh Kale or Finnish Kale person that they're not White. (They are literally as White looking and genetically European as what every passes for White in the minds' of today's racists, as they tend to be over 75 White.) Also, we were raped and enslaved in what is now modern day Romania by Romanians (see Vlach Roma of Transylvania) and many of us share \textbf{common} Romanian ancestries. And, as you apparently do not know, our name means "husbands/men/people". It is pure coincidence that our Hindi-derived name resembles the name of those who made us distinctly European in the first place. In regard to your whole Hungarians hating Romanians-thing, that's because Europeans of all shapes, colors and sizes, including Hungarians, hate Romania and is people.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Drago»ô well germany has also been invaded at multiple times by the people you mentioned, plus the awares, vikings, swedes, danes, spanish, french, polish lithuanians etc. I think the main reason for the discrepancy is simply the failure of communism. germany had to restart at 0 in 1945, as pretty much everything was utterly destroyed and most men were dead, crippled, or in captivity, plus having a \textbf{refugee} crisis by the entire remaining people of eastern prussia and silesia had to flee their homeland. So we started at the worst conditions imaginable, being also forced to let other countries take hold of the little natural resources we have, and yet the western part strived, becoming at one point the biggest exporteur world wide, while our eastern part had a head start and was doing better in the early years, but later failed and collapsed like all \textbf{communist} countries. Today we are still the third biggest exporteur world wide, but due to the burden of reunification, we didn't have nearly the growth, nor any rising real payment since 1990, plus we had have to put billions into rebuilding and modernizing, while also facing the problem of all the young people leaving the east, while the rest has problems finding work and as a society with a disproportional amount of radical political trouble (extreme amount of neo nazis and left wing extremists compared to the rest). As eastern germany had the benefit of having a rich country to reunify with after the collapse of the soviets, the aftermath might not be as apparent as in other former east block countries, yet it still demonstrates in my oppinion, that the 45 years of communism had way more influence on todays prosperity of its former countries, than the centuries prior.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Communist, Refugee & \cellcolor{green!5} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/296 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.676 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@THEO the agenda shill, gipsy is autonomous for neromi. Specifically, the term \textbf{gypsy} is an exon (name given by others, from the outside). For example, to understand, I am of Roma origin, in my romanes' language I say to the bulgarians, " o das", we call them turkish "xoraxian" and the germans say "gadskeno". But we use the phrase "pledge" in the sense that they are strangers, outside of our \textbf{ethnicity}. If we judge with the same measure of measure, it means the name is the correct answer given to the bulgarians from the romans, or the correct denomination of bulgarians and all peoples is as those peoples are recommended? And the japanese were saying "waeni" before, and romanians in Romania used to call themselves "valahi" and the germans call themselves "deutch", but idiots do not know that every people has the right to identity ... Bulgarians do well to learn history! We know who the Bulgarians are and what their origins are, but they are not very educated to know that a name can not be given immutable, that is, always. And if you still say that the name of the \textbf{gypsy} is ok, adopt you will have the name of gypsies, so that I can call you in my speech as the "Bulgarian turkey \textbf{crow}", then to debit that is the correct denunciation of the crows Anatolian Bulgarian, the one that comes from my speech.

It is well known that the name rome comes from the ancestors of the Italians, etruscans, but no one knows that the etruscans were dravidian generations. So, you are doing an imitation of who the dravidians are, and where their basic origins come from, then you will see why the roma  people call themselves '' roma '', because that name is an entomology originating in India and designating an avatar, such as Egiptyan, Ra, or that of the ancient Indians, Ram, or Rama. So, this denomination, rom, does not come from the latin, but was taken from their etruscan ancestors, who were of dravidian origin. I know it seems to be impossible to believe, but the historical paintings and archaeologists in Italy and other areas also proves linguistically and historically that the etruscans were dravidian. Not as the Italian historians did not know who their ancestors were, but the europeans did not admit that the \textbf{common} ancestor of man would be the \textbf{African}.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African, Common & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}2/166 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.205 \\  \hline

As to the diligence of the majority Romanians, the shameful history of Romania contradicts, because the collective Romania is clearly a form of economic and social exploitation.

So the racists also invented Aryan theory, because they do not admit that their ancestors come from Africa! Although, migration is recognized and adopted by most DNA scientists, the Dacians were Scythians (Iranians). Thrace, was the name of all Thracian citizens of whatever origin. Always the Indians beat the face of the Iranians that they were one and the same when they lived on the Indus Valley, the Iranians beat their face to the Turks reminding them that you forgot that they were descending from the Iranians, and so the Bulgarian, Bulgarians, omit that they were drawn from the Turks . But the so-called Indo-European peoples are actually those from Asia. I always beat the face of the Greeks coming from Asia, the island of Lidia and Crete, always knocking the cheeks of the so-called Italians whose ancestors were Etruscan Dravidian. As for the Dacians and the so-called Latino Italians, although the Latins were those in the Latium area (today Lazio), they forget that Latins are now in the present, and the Slavs are from the sixth century, as do the Iranian Dacians . This explains why the Romanian and Italian historians did not want to reveal the truth about such mysterious Dacian and Etruscan figures, because they were ashamed to be a nation\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African, Common, Nation & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Nationality - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}3/234 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.282 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Kinda, but we were also targeted for genocide (twice), are still segregated, no one cares about us, are literally the most Whitewashed group in Hollywood (even non-White people parade around on screen as us), and are arguably, very genetically different from many of our ancestors. That being said, we are actually not "\textbf{Indian}". We left India 1,500 years ago, and even though we usually possess 25 to 75 South Asian heritage, we are a distinctly European peoples. (I use "peoples" because we are comprised of numerous sub-groups and each group has varying degrees of Whiteness and Brownness. Calling us \textbf{Indian} is like calling a Sephardic person only Middle Eastern \& North \textbf{African}, instead of mixed Spanish and pre-European Jewish. At the end of the day, the Sephardi are distinctly European, whilst still being of non-White Jewish heritage, but are usually seen as White and European because of their considerable Iberian heritage. We too, are arguably White and are never 90 \textbf{Indian} the same way that \textbf{African}-Americans can be 90+ Sub-Saharan \textbf{African}. Like, you don't have to be bi-racial or have had a White slave master ancestor to be \textbf{African}-American and conversely, you don't have to even be the descendant of an American slave (e.g., Haitian, Brazilian, Puerto Rica, etc.) to be \textbf{Black}, and even some cases \textbf{African}-American. If you're \textbf{Black}, you're still \textbf{Black} and aren't entirely separate from your pre-slavery ancestors. Also, calling us \textbf{Indian} would mean that all Desi people living in Europe and facing discrimination would also be considered Romani, which just isn't the case. A man from Punjab who immigrates to Hungary and has a child with a Magyar women wouldn't produce a Roma child.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Europeans have for hundreds of years harassed the Romani and denied them equal positions in our society, and then after treating them like that for some centuries we blame them for the non-integration we forced on them(just scroll through all the negative comments here and see for yourself).Yet I have several Romani descendant friends who've had to tell me of their origin before I knew, they were as integrated and Norwegian as anyone else. The \textbf{old} Romani population here is more or less completely integrated by now, it's the never arrivals from Russia the past century, and now in later years from Balkan, which are not.And seeing that they can do, and does do, well in Latin America, it's obvious to me it's the treatment they have received that is the cause of their problems, and not the other way around. If you treat someone as shit for years and years, guess what will happen to them. You try doing that to anyone and the result will be pretty sad, try it on your own child of you want to test it out, all humans are results of our surroundings.Taken for example \textbf{African} American. The crime rate among \textbf{African} American is higher than any \textbf{African} country, with the exception of Lesotho, Namibia and South Africa(which by the way is probably the three countries where the colonial rule and Apartheid had the most oppressing results). So obviously it's the treatment of \textbf{African} American which is the cause of their high crime rate, and not genetics. This is as evident as it gets. And the same goes with the Romani.It's the people who write hateful comments here about the Romani, which is exactly the cause for the problems from the Romani. These haters are in essence shitting on their own legs, in a wider context. What a bunch of fucking idiots.Please think about that the next time you decide to stigmatize and spread hate towards a group of people.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Paul MunteanThis whole "they refuse to integrate" argument again? You're missing my point, you're not really arguing against any of my hypothesis. I've already said they have integrated well in a lot of places, like here in Scandinavia, and across the pond as well. So if your whole "they refuse to integrate" argument is to work, you need to explain why they chose to integrate other places. My hypothesis is the chances they were given. You cannot blame people for not taking chances they were never really given.The place in Europe where they are the least integrated is in Eastern Europe, which also happens to be the most \textbf{racist} place of all of Europe. You think that's a coincidence?If you have a different claim you have to explain what that claim is, and why it is so, not just come with the simplistic "they refuse to integrate!" utterance. " And you think all that is happening because some generations ago, they were oppressed?"It takes more that a couple of generation to change a culture. It's a long process. And the way to start it, is  not  to say stuff like what has been said in this comment section."They're not the only minority that suffered oppresion in the past. For example, during WW2, jews had the same treatment, maybe even worse, yet they managed to integrate."The Jews integrated more or less long before WW2. They were in the core of European culture for centuries, producing so many of our scientists, philosophers, inventors, capitalists etc. Now they've all either been slaughtered, or moved to Israel and America - and we've lost unthinkable potential in the European Ashkenazim Jews(which have an average IQ of about 110-115, the only \textbf{ethnic} group more intelligent than East Asians) - our oppression made them move out of here; it's is not the greatest example of integration now is it?I think the Sami is a better comparison, given that they are also traditionally a nomadic people, and that they were living pretty simple lives(well, not the Sea Samis, but the Mountain Samis) just a hundred or so years ago. The Samis have kept their identity, their language(somewhat), their reindeer herds, but yet are still functioning members in society, educated and participating. They were given a chance. Not even a fair chance, they've been given less of a chance compared to other Norwegians and Swedes, but still they've been given a chance.We have to sit down and talk with the Romani instead of calling them names, improve their schools instead of complaining they don't send their kids there, improve their standards of living instead of complaining they live in tents, improve working opportunities instead of complain they steal. There is no other solution, the same \textbf{old} blame-game is not a solution at all. It won't resolve anything at all.Take the Norwegian prison system, which has gotten a lot of attention world-wide the past year for being too soft. But they have very good results to show, for being soft, the prisoners mostly returns to society as functioning members.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Talis - da - Man educate urself on some facts and history :There has never been such a country called Palestine. Israel was RE-formed on land previously ruled by the Ottoman empire, similarly to other countries in the region such as Lebanon, Iraq and others. There is no such thing as "Palestinian people". It's worth noting that newspapers such as the 'Palestine post' were Jewish newspapers (this one for example turned into the 'Jerusalem post'). This is also true about other official "Palestine" related stuff from the time before Israel was RE-formed. If you happened to say "Palestinian" before the RE-formation of Israel, you were actually referring to the Hebrews living in the land, not the Arabs. Take a look at this flag book from 1939 (3rd row on the right): imgur.com/a/4hlH2The term "Palestine" was later discarded, as it should have been, because the original name for the land - Israel, has been restored (it's simple: Israel is not Palestine, just like Jerusalem is not Aelia-Capitolina, and Schem is not Nablus).It is only in the mid 1960's that the Arabs hijacked the term, and its widespread usage only took off after the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. the Arabs used this terminology as a political propaganda tool to de-legitimize Israel, after they failed to steal the Hebrew homeland by force with the Arab armies, by invading and attempting to conquer the land. Ironically, the term "Palestinian" originate from the term 'Pleshet' to describe INVADERS by the Hebrews. Those who willingly identify as "Palestinians" are declaring themselves to be invaders/colonizers in Hebrew land. It's important to note that this propaganda tool was supported by the Communists/Soviets. On the other hand, just a few decades before that, the Arab "Palestinians" were hand in hand with the Nazis. They have aided them under the leadership of the mufti Amin Al Husseini - who is often regarded 'founding father' of the Arab "Palestinians". Mufti Amin Al Husseini became an SS general, but he had anti-jewish genocidal ideology long before the Nazis rose the power. He has incited and caused violence and terror against the Jewish people in their homeland since the early 1920's (for example: causing the 1929 Hebron massacre).Yasser Arafat, the first official "Palestinian" leader was an Arab from Egypt, who was born and raised in Egypt and lived there till the 1950's - some "Palestinian" eh? Arab "Palestinians" are \textbf{nothing} more than bands of foreign Arab invaders and illegal immigrants from all over the Arab and Islamic world (some of them even originating from places that are not part of the middle-east, such as Bosnia). Most of them came as recent as the 19th and 20th centuries. As for those who were before that - most of those were Arab Bedouins who are Arab nomadic tribes who did not permanently settle in places, and thus did not stay for prolonged periods of time. Many Arabs even came to Gaza, Judea and Samaria from Egypt and Jordan while these areas were under Egyptian and Jordanian occupation on the periods between 1948 to 1967.Here are some very informative and interesting quotes directly Arab "Palestinian" leaders: "There is no such country as Palestine. 'Palestine' is a term the Zionists invented. There is no Palestine in the bible ...Palestine is \textbf{ALIEN} to us" - Arab "Palestinian" leader Awni Abdul-Hadi, Peel Commission, 1937. "The Palestinian people does not exist. The creation of a Palestinian state is only a means for continuing our struggle against the state of Israel for our Arab unity. In reality today there is no difference between Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese. Only for political and tactical reasons do we speak today about the existence of a Palestinian people, since Arab national interests demand that we posit the existence of a distinct "Palestinian people" to oppose Zionism. Yes, the existence of a separate Palestinian identity exists only for tactical reasons, Jordan, which is a sovereign state with defined borders, cannot raise claims to Haifa and Jaffa, while as a Palestinian, I can undoubtedly demand Haifa, Jaffa, Beer-Sheva and Jerusalem. However, the moment we reclaim our right to all of Palestine, we will not wait even a minute to unite Palestine and Jordan." - Arab "Palestinian" leader \& PLO member Zuheir Mohsen, 1977. "We all have Arab roots, and every Palestinian in Gaza and throughout Palestine can prove his Arab roots - whether from Saudi Arabia, Yemen or anywhere else." "... Half the Palestinians are (Arab) Egyptians and the other half are (Arab) Saudis" - Arab "Palestinian" Hamas minister Fathi Hammad, 2012.Here are some of the most \textbf{common} family names among the "Palestinians":"Masri" = from Egypt-Hamas member of Parliament, Mushir al-Masri (the word "masri" littelery means "the egyptian" in arabic !)."Khamis"= Bahrain "Salem Hanna Khamis" "al-Faruqi"= Mosul, Iraq"al-Araj" = Morocco, a member of the Saadi Dynasty "Hussein al-Araj""al Lubnani" = the Lebanese"al-Mughrabi" = the Moroccan (Maghreb" ‚Äì meaning "West" in Arabic, and usually referring to North Africa or specifically to Morocco)"al-Djazair" = the Algerian"al-Yamani" = the Yemeni "Issam Al Yamani""al-Afghani" = the Afghan"al-Hindi" = the \textbf{Indian} "Amin al-Hindi""Iraqi" = from Iraq."halabi" = from Aleppo, Syria"El Baghdadi" = from Baghdad Iraq."Tarabulsi"= Tarabulus-Tripoli, Lebanon."Hourani" = Houran Syria."al-Husayni" = Saudi Arabia."Saudi" = Saudi Arabia."Metzarwah"= Egypt."Barda---wil" = "Salah Bardawil" HAMAS legislator in Gaza; Egypt, Bardawil Lake area."Nashashibi" = Syria."Bushnak" = Bosnia"zoabi"= from Iraq: "Haneen Zoabi"."Turki" = Turkey "Daud Turki""al-Kurd" = Kurdistan."Haddadins" = YEMEN descended from Ghassanid Christian Arabs."Arab Abu-Kishk" = Egypt.(Bedouins)"Arab al shakirat" = Egypt (Bedouins)"Arab al zabidat" = Egypt (Bedouins)"Arab al aramsha" = Egypt (Bedouins)"Abu Sitta" = In Arabic' Abu means father and sitta means six. Translated it actually means father of six. (The Abu Sitta family primarily received this name because around the year 1700, a well known knight of the large Al-Tarabeen tribe always had six slaves (i.e. fedawyah, bodyguards), 3 on each side, with him. They were with him wherever he went, day or night. Hence the name "ABU SITTA." = Egypt (Bedouins) "Salman Abu Sitta ".)Even Yasser Arafat, the most famous "Palestinian" and leader of the P.L.O \textbf{terrorist} organization, was not native to Judea. He called himself a "Palestinian \textbf{refugee}" but spoke Arabic with an Egyptian accent. He was born in 1929 Cairo, Egypt. He served in the Egyptian army, studied in the University of Cairo, and lived in Cairo until 1956! His full name was Mohammed Abdel Rahman Abdel Raouf Arafat al-Qudwa al-Husseini. "Al-Qudwa" tribe origin?Yasser Arafat also proudly stated in his authorized biography that, "If there is any such thing as a Palestinian people, it is I, Yasser Arafat, who created them."Here is some genetic data for Arab "Palestinian": According to a 2010 study by Behar et al. titled "The genome-wide structure of the Jewish people", Palestinians tested clustered genetically close to Bedouins, Jordanians and Saudi Arabians which was described as "consistent with a \textbf{common} origin in the Arabian Peninsula".A study found that the Palestinians, have what appears to be Female-Mediated gene flow in the form of Maternal DNA Haplogroups from Sub-Saharan Africa. Palestinian individuals tested, carried maternal haplogroups that originated in Sub-Saharan Africa. The most likely explanation for the presence of predominantly female lineages of \textbf{African} origin in these areas is that they may trace back to women brought from Africa as part of the Arab slave trade, assimilated into the areas under Arab rule.In a genetic study of Y-chromosomal STRs in two populations from Israel and the Palestinian Authority Area: Christian and Muslim Palestinians showed genetic differences.A 2013 study of Haber and et al. found that "The predominantly Muslim populations of Syrians, Palestinians and Jordanians cluster on branches with other Muslim populations as distant as Morocco and Yemen."The authors explained that "religious affiliation had a strong impact on the genomes of the Levantines. In particular, conversion of the region's populations to Islam appears to have introduced major rearrangements in populations' relations through admixture with culturally similar but geographically remote populations leading to genetic similarities between remarkably distant populations."The authors also reconstructed the genetic structure of pre-Islamic Levant and found that "it was more genetically similar to Europeans than to (nowadays) Middle Easterners".HIGHLY RECOMMENDED VIDEOS TO WATCH:youtube.com/watch?v=IJggz2HIkS4youtube.com/watch?v=SN838zu6iioyoutube.com/watch?v=u8ELap2uhkALet us now see what the \textbf{Quran} itself says:And thereafter We (Allah) said to the Children of Israel: 'Dwell securely in the Promised Land.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I found this thread pretty interesting to read through. My own experiences with Romani/Gypsies began with a Bosnian Serb girlfriend in Vojvodina who primarily kept warning me to be careful every time we were walking around and passed some Gypsies. We once went to Ireland together in 2007, just after Schengen had opened up to some of the Romani, and passed several groups of Gypsies on a bus ride from Dublin to Galway. And each time we passed them, she laughed at what she perceived as ignorance concerning Schengen, namely that she believed that Western Europe would soon be overrun by Romani.I later had a Slavic Macedonian girlfriend in Skopje. She was poor and decided to live in a cheap part of Skopje that was about 50 Albanian Macedonians and 30 Macedonian Gypsies. While she lived there for about two years, she got to know some local Albanians and Romani as friends (rare for a Slavic Macedonian). At the time I already had some Albanian friends from Kosovo, but it was the first chance I'd ever really had to talk in depth with Gypsies.ls7orBust: Did a Cigani ever actually steal anything from you? You failed to mention any details.Planet Watcher: Thank you for the one comment amongst 31 that offered some insight: "Maybe they refuse to integrate, because they hate your people out of past grievances. Get 5 Euros, give them five Euros, ask one to set around for a talk, offer them food to stay. Do not piss them off nor get angry towards."Jamie Johnson: My understanding is that the European Romani languages have their closest relations with the Marwari language of Rajasthan. DNA evidence among today's Romani will of course show an Eastern European component, but this is primarily because the Romani have been living AMONGST Eastern Europeans for a thousand years, rather than showing an East European ORIGIN. As an anthropologist, surely you understand the difference.One thing I noticed among the 31 comments was that only a single one came from an actual Romani. I'd really appreciate it if there are some Romani who would be interested in writing about your own experiences. I realise there will be some shitty people who will respond to you in a shitty way, and I apologise to you for that in advance.Nonetheless, I would be greatly interested in hearing some perspectives from actual Romani. And thank you in advance for that. P.S. And just so everybody knows, I'm not just a sympathizer for Gypsies. I once had a wallet with about 20.000 rubles stolen by a Romani I met and got drunk with on a train from Moscow to Kazan. Even though it really pissed me off at the time, I ultimately just chalk up negative experiences like this as having met an asshole who happened to be a Gypsie, rather than to say something like all Romani must be thieves just because I had a particular bad experience with one member of their \textbf{race}.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/501 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.2 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Jamie Johnson : Those who knew what Romani means are always sent to the \textbf{racist} area. If you are able to display such absurdities as "proves" than you finished the school only in your imagination. 1. Gypsies homeland is in northern India. They were one of the poorest casts there and they were forced to leave because they acted exactly as they do today. What they have in \textbf{common} with Eastern Europe? They found a place where they were relatively safe with the support obtained from the rulers, Ottoman Empire. Remember, in Germany and other Western countries they used to hang them if they were not burned alive. 2. The only languages that ARE NOT Indo-Europeans are Hungarian (there are a lot of gypsies in Hungary...), Finnish, Estonian, Basque, Maltese and few in Russia. So, saying that gypsies are from Eastern Europe because there is the space where the Indo-European languages are spoken is totally wrong. 3. You suppose to be only a British Anthropologist to sustain that DNA found on these people comes from Eastern Europe while all the companies show important percents of Eastern Asian in those people and almost \textbf{nothing} from the general DNA map of this region. You should understand that gypsies live in closed societies governed by their own rules and rulers. Therefore, a mixture with other people only accidentally happened.  4. Placing an equal sign between the Great British Empire and the Poor Countries of Eastern Europe is another, let's say, mistake. Brits were lucky to do not support the year by year assault of Ottomans, Russians, Habsburgs, and many many others. Also, to forget the horrors of the Communism is another display of infatuation and proves you have huge problems with the simplest understand of history.5. I never judge a whole population after few idiots. You have your own examples in the British society, I will not enter into details. But I found that Roma people have too many idiots between them. This is a simple reality and has \textbf{nothing} to do with \textbf{racism}. They oppose to all the \textbf{common} rules and we are not able to educate the majority of them. And, as I saw the results of your amazing Western work, you failed, too. A quick example: France has given to 185 gypsies 200 euros to leave the country and return to Romania. Guess what? In 2 weeks they went back to France hoping to grab another portion of the money. So, easy with this kind of logic, it is a total nonsense. 6. I am sick of the way of some "British" show their love for the foreigners while they choose to exclude yourselves from EU. You guys are saying something and thinking the opposite. When we, Eastern Europeans show sincerity and a straight way when a problem occurs, you do not believe us. Apparently. And you are glad because the \textbf{Brexit} happened. What can I add? You will see another truth in few years: you need more Eastern Europeans than we need you. But then it will be late. Too late. 7. Do you think the gypsies are poor people and you cry for them? Well, see yourself how much they steal from your country by typing in youtube search bar "Palatele tiganilor din Romania". If you still digest those people other than what they are then I stop here because it is useless to add something else. I have the feeling that I lost my time with you.

It happens all over the world, including the USA, Australia, Mexico, etc. Stop blaming it on that.- What difference does the Sudan situation make?

Just look at america, canada, australia, south africa and the whole of south america. That's millions compered to how many immigrants europe has."  Yeah, absolutely none of this has ANYTHING to do with white people. In the case of the Sudan, this was something that happened between non-white people.

I'm not saying that the Europeans are "bad", just that they were a product of their circumstances - poor, uneducated and isolated, and therefore extremely xenophobic.

When the Gypsies arrived in Europe, there simply was no option for them to integrate, because there's absolutely no way a medieval European village would welcome a bunch of different looking foreigners with a different language and religion. So yes, they began stealing, but to pretend that it's all \textbf{black} and white - that the Gypsies just have thievery built into their DNA would be just as ridiculous as an ancient roman saying that the germanic peoples have thievery built into their DNA because at the time they constantly raided roman borders.

The closest thing we would have to actual subspecies would be isolated populations like Australian Aboriginals and \textbf{African} Pygmies, and even they have a decent amount of non-Aboriginal and non-Pygmy heritage.Back to the Neanderthal point: Neanderthals were roughly as smart as modern humans, despite their larger brains. They were more developed in some parts of their brains than we are, but they were also underdeveloped in certain regions too. We "conquered" them thanks to us having superior numbers, as Neanderthals were never a very large species to begin with. Over time, the Neanderthals who didn't go to war with Homo sapiens bred themselves to extinction, and the last remnants of them died out some 30,000-40,000 years ago in Southern Europe.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Joorpi Mannon These are Turkmen :  [LINK] Do they look \textbf{Mongoloid}? Don't think so.What if I told you there are many different types of Turks and Turkic languages, and that Turks have never been entirely \textbf{Mongoloid}?There are Oƒüuz, Uyghur, Kipchak, Oƒüur and Yakut/Siberian Turks and all differ from each other both genetically and linguistically. Central Asian Turks are not as closely related as one would suggest, there is a big difference between a Turkmen (Oƒüuz) and a Kazakh (Kipchak).All Turks are a mix of the Caucasoid and \textbf{Mongoloid} races, Turks do not belong to one \textbf{race}, unlike most Subsaharan Africans, East Asians \& Native Americans and Europeans. Kipchaks are Turks that have always been more \textbf{Mongoloid} than Caucasoid, while Oƒüuz Turks have always been more Caucasoid than \textbf{Mongoloid}. Genetic studies show Turkmen are 18‚Äì40 \textbf{Mongoloid} or East Asian.There is a lot of confusion due to this fact. Genetic studies on Turkey's Turks often use 'Central Asian' and 'East Asian' interchangeably while they are two distinct things. The Turks seem to have 5‚Äì15 East Asian or \textbf{Mongoloid} ancestry, with peaks as high as 20, but researchers call this ancestry 'Central Asian' due to confusion. The Central Asian ancestry of Turks is actually higher than that because of part of our ancestry that is racially Caucasoid but from Central, not West Asia.Commercial DNA tests also do this. They look at your \textbf{Mongoloid} ancestry and then interpret only that as Central or East Asian. This is why Uzbeks and Turkmen score more West Asia than Central Asia with these DNA tests. They are very faulty and need improvement.GEDmatch is a site that does not do this but compares your ancestry to that of random individuals from many \textbf{ethnic} groups, including Turkmen. So Caucasoid ancestry from Turkmenistan will be interpreted as Turkmen.My DNA test told me I am 16 West Asian and 4 Central Asian, GEDmatch tells me I am somewhere between ~13‚Äì22.3 Turkmen. Anatolian Turks are often 50- 25 Turkmen, while Balkan Turks are often 25-12.5 Turkmen. Azerbaijani Turks can be anywhere between ~6-50 Turkmen and many of them have Anatolian Turkish ancestry as well because Selim I sent Shia Turcoman tribes to Iran, which controlled ethnographic Azerbaijan.Because we still have quite some Turkmen ancestry, many of us look like them. But since we have a lot of non-Turkmen ancestry as well, there are also many people that look like westernmost Asians or Europeans. But looking European does not mean they have no Turkmen ancestry. Your appearance is decided while you are in your early development stages, still in your mothers belly and the way you look is completely random. That is why one sibling can be blue-eyed and blonde, but his sister can be a brunette and brown-eyed. Their looks are different, but their ancestry is the exact same.My own cousins are like that. One of them is blue eyed, very pale and blond, her sister looks like me; \textbf{tan}, brown-eyed and a brunette. However, both have Central Asian ancestry.I also want to mention that there are 15 million Turkish citizens like Circassians, Lazes, Albanians, Bosniaks and more that generally do not have Central Asian ancestry and they are very \textbf{common} in Turkey as you can tell by their number. However, they feel Turkish so they also identify as Turkish. That's another reason why Turkey has many White citizens. Most of these Circassians, Albanians, Bosniaks etc. (especially the latter two) settled in West Turkey. Izmir and the Marmara region are full with Albanians and Bosniaks! Turks from Macedonia as well, one neighbourhood, a quite big one too, is almost entirely inhabited by Turks from Macedonia.My mom's family also lives there.. and we are also Turks from Macedonia!Bottom line : There are Turks that look like the Turkmen settlers, and Turks that look more like ancient Anatolians or Europeans, but all have Central Asian ancestry.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Common, Ethnic, Mongoloid, Race, Tan & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General, Nationality - British, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}12/654 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.835 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Elias Turkified Greeks my ass. The Greeks and Armenians of Anatolia were merely hellenized and armenified Anatolians like Leo pointed out. Tigran the Great armenified the region and spread Armenian culture and language. Alexander the Great, Christianity and subsequently the Byzantines all hellenized Anatolia, but their genetics were in no way Greek.Matter of fact, the Byzantine emperors and Trapezuntian scholars even called the Empire of Trebizond \textbf{nothing} more than a Lazic border state, because there were almost only Lazes that became hellenized overtime. Hence genetic studies show Pontic Greeks have literally almost no Greek ancestry.The Greek language came from the Proto-Indo-European homeland in Ukraine/Russia. By means of migrations the Indo-Europeans spread to many regions in the world and assimilated the pre-Indo-European peoples of the regions they settled in. Some regions were settled by many Indo-European tribes, like Kyrgyzstan and Kashmir, but others not so much. Genetic studies show that Greeks barely have ancestry from Indo-Europeans, especially Cretans. What happened is, after 3000 BC the Greek Indo-European tribes who were heavily outnumbered by pre-Greeks imposed their identity and language on the pre-Greeks, who had their own identity and language but lost those due to the assimilation. The modern Greeks are primarily descended from pre-Greeks.The exact same process happened to Turks. There are two differences : 1. Turks have more Central Asian ancestry than Greeks have Indo-European ancestry 2. Anatolian Turks assimilated and mixed with non-Turks after 1071 while Greeks assimilated and mixed with non-Greeks around 3000-1500 BC. So if you say Turks are fake Turks, Greeks must be fake Greeks too...Our \textbf{nation} is Turkish and we are not Greek or Armenian. Heck, even Greeks and Armenians are largely just assimilated Anatolians. Many Byzantine Anatolians and even royals like John Tzelepes Komnenos willingly converted to Islam and became Turks. Matter of fact, a Byzantine prince helped the Ottomans to gain hold of Gallipoli which is the reason Ottomans could conquer the Balkans!We are Turks and our \textbf{nation} is Turkey. It was established by many peoples that became Turkish and every single \textbf{nation} was created like that. The island of Lemnos was still pre-Greek until Athenians hellenized it in the 600 BC! Where are the Leleges? Tyrrhenians? Pelasgians? Colchines? Huh? Where are they? They were assimilated by am extremely small amount of Indo-European Greeks. Should I call you hellenized non-Greeks now? Ofcourse not. You are just a butthurt, \textbf{racist} and insecure little child that hates Turks with a passion. Instead of hating on Turks for things that happened to all peoples, start hating on your own people for deporting you to foreign lands only because of your religion. If your ancestors said they were Greek, why didn't the government let them stay? I am angry at my government for not letting the Turkish Christians of Karaman, who proudly fought for our independence, stay although they wanted so much. I dont hate on Greece for accepting them.

They are a result of Alexander's army and they have maintained them values ie they marry in the same tribe and they don't mix with any other group of people.
