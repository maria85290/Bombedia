  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Also, most parents won't get involved in technology if they were use to not using it. It is like doing math mentally for 50 years then expect them to use a calculator when it becomes available.

Personally, I think relying on technology too much might \textbf{cripple} the mind. They will need to think or act less to perform the same task.
