Porn continues to exist, PARTLY cawz, (so-called) 'regular' women do NOT know how to treat their men, sooo, he looks else-where for:  release, satisfaction, \&/or, 'entertainment' (etc.)!  The REAL blame here, belongs to the hidden elites \& organizationz who front \& fund porn \& for the destruction of hetero-relationships:  FemiNazi'z, Socialists, \& the 'Divorce-Corp' (U.S. family-law 'profit-system').

I'm still looking at porn websites to see if porn stars and adult actresses are still making and producing more new pornographic materials you will be surprised that there are more new porn stars filming and producing \textbf{sex} tapes. So why do self righteous people want to judge and act like they are holy or something. \textbf{Nobody} cares about your thoughts and opinions including porn stars. If people enjoy selling their bodies and having \textbf{sex} on camera than so be it. Also I want to mention in western countries \textbf{nobody} is interested in marriages and serious relationships. Women initiate majority of the divorces so who cares if people want to watch porn. Some people want to marry porn stars, strippers, escorts, hookers and prostitutes because they are in love with them. Some people are interested in \textbf{sexual} relationship than serious relationship.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I'm not pointing finger at her choice of work. But I do say that it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to date her. Simply because when you date someone you'd think that they're only with you intimately, just as you are with them but in that line of job that won't happen. Your date is intimately with many others, it's all open to everyone to see on Internet, you need to test yourself because you can't be 100 sure that one of her "co-workers" didn't get something which now she has too. And of course the jealousy, that's a natural part of life. I don't mean going \textbf{crazy} over it, that's stupid but also can't really go on if you know that your partner is "doing it" with others on a daily basis, job or no job. No matter how you look at it, you still feel bad and cheated on.So yeah, if she likes that job and wants to do it then go ahead, not saying anything about that. But it is true, dating life is pretty much impossible, unless she'd date someone from totally different country where she may not be perhaps known as well (which in the time of Internet may be impossible), and of course would not be in that business anymore. There would still be always the chanced that at some point, someone around her would say "hey, aren't you that person on Internet in that porn movie?" and, as it usually is, go around and sharing the news with everyone, of course. And like she said, even dating someone inside the industry can still cause issues with jealousy and health and so on.

It kind of seems like she is disappointed a normal relationship doesn't work out. And I totally respect that she treats working in porn as a legitimate and normal line of work. All good.But for your average human being (whether they choose to admit this or not) \textbf{sex} is an emotionally bonding experience. The part of your brain that the feel good chemicals hit (oxytocin) are also the same area that correlate to attachment and feeling of deep connection.When you're screwing lots of guys (one way or another) you are devaluing the uniqueness that most people feel about bonding. Once again whether most people choose to admit this or not, not everyone feels comfortable opening them selves up to anyone for this experience.Its easy to say well "alot of guys go out to bars and sleep with lots of women", yeah sure. But the misconception here is that this is the norm. People who operate in these circles will have you believe this, but its not what most people want (by a landslide majority). Its the same as saying all women want is a big dick. Not the case!In a normal world, if you have a partner who asks you for constant std tests, well.... thats not a relationship. Trust being the key component.This \textbf{woman}'s POV on how she would like her life to be makes her come across as delusional to the point of psychopathic.I get feminism, I fully support it.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Alwyn April Well, I can imagine some do "feel" this way. I just seriously question the reason(s) why people "choose" to sell their body for money. I have a hard time to believe it is a childhood dream to have \textbf{sex} with strangers for money without emotional implication and intimacy, so if it is not then it is a conditioning, and I tend to hear from all the \textbf{sex} workers from all places in the world that they either got abused before entering the industry or that they lacked attention, love and affection and developed serious self-esteem issues. At the same time I do understand that some people see \textbf{sex} differently than others and I do believe ALL people deserve respect and care. Which is precisely why I question the well-being and health of the sew workers because it is dangerous not only for the body but for the heart and the spirit, of course if you don't believe in spirit in people you may think I serve you spiritual bullshit and that's ok, that's your belief. I mean really who wants to get sodomized almost everyday for years?!... By huge "things"? In front of a camera? And say it's what they really want? Do you know how they "prepare" and deal with this on sets? I encourage you to research it, it is gross.... Not to mention the anal issues that come with a regular practice on the long term... And what is the percentage of sew workers who have a happy and nourishing LOVE life? You can listent to Bree Olsen's interview who cries because she feels so rejected and judged all the time because people just see her as a whore... Now again, I personally respect her like any other living creature on this planet, no matter what they did. As I believe judging is makig the world the hellhole it has become... Yet, I cannot believe social death NOR glorification is the way to treat \textbf{sex} workers. People with a super high libido can go to private clubs, do orgies, meet \textbf{sex} partners on the internet.... But as soon as money is involved PLUS regarding porn workers, the abandonment of ones image rights for life, I just cannot believe it is making them happy on the long run. And again all the interviews, articles, research I have read or listened to reveal the obvious sadness behind the bright white smiles and make-up, or the incoherence in the speech when they just say it is fun to get gang-banged. How can a human being live its whole life without experiencing deep intimacy with another human being? Care, affection, love, tenderness, laughter, caresses, do you see this often in porn? And by the way, have you checked the other sources I mentioned? I didn't only talked about fightthenewdrug...!

Just because some people get exploited in the industry or do not like their job, does that mean the industry itself should not exist?If you cannot personally believe or imagine yourself feeling or doing something, does that mean that other people cannot? Or does it rather speak to your own lack of imagination or perhaps relevant knowledge and experience?If you only listen to one side of the story, of course you will develop only a one-sided view of the reality. What do the \textbf{sex} workers who advocate for themselves actually say?I work in public health in my day job and have conducted research into \textbf{sex} work, volunteer with a \textbf{sex} workers rights organisation in my country and regularly interact with many different kinds of \textbf{sex} workers, and have engaged in \textbf{sex} work myself on a few occasions.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Alwyn April I do feel kind of the same way about other industry work yes. The difference though with the porn industry is that having \textbf{sex}, having someone's parts inside of yours, exchanging fluids, etc. involves, according to me, more consequences than other sorts of exchange. I would be curious to know what brought you to engage in \textbf{sex} work, and what you gained from it, how do you feel about it. I need to point out that I never said the porn industry should not exist. I have listened and will probably still listen to different points of view, I do not wish to share about my personal experiences here but my view on \textbf{sex} for money has changed and has evolved, which still allows me to understand why some people do it or consume it. Are you worried or angry by assuming I lack imagination?! Yes, I do see differences in taste and behaviour and preferences in humans and that can be such an enriching thing! Nevertheless, I express my feelings and point of view here. I guess that is what people do on a chat, isn't it? I find it a little frustrating thoug that you question some of my personality traits but don't answer any questions I have asked so far. What's the deal here?! To finish, I would add that I have a problem with body and \textbf{sex} not being sacred, which is also part of the shoratges of the "modern" world which create  a lot of pain on this planet, and it hasn't started just recently.... By saying "sacred" I mean a link with our divine nature, our link to soul, spirit, Gaia, the Goddess, God, or whatever ones wants to call something encompassing all living life. And this doesn't mean to me that \textbf{sex} should only be practised in the "holy estate of matrimony", as matrimony is men's invention and doesn't always fit my view and definition of the sacred. Having \textbf{sex} is to me, and to ancient practices in different parts of the world a union which engages for longer than the duration of the act itself, I believe in energies and I believe that when you have \textbf{sex} you carry the partner's energy inside you for a long time, and that has an impact on your life. Also, I feel sorry that in most of porn content on tha most popular platforms there is a tendency to violence, \textbf{sexism}, domination, and nearly systematic white shower endings which are supposed to please these women so much...: Hum...Not all women like this first of all, plus women are cyclic and this cycle is not always respected when they work in the \textbf{sex} industry which is a violence against their body and their soul. Having \textbf{sex} without consent is to me a tremendous harm for the human and it happens a lot in this world, and it does happen often in the \textbf{sex} industry. I don't feel surprised you say many \textbf{sex} workers you have talked to don't fit the "stereotypes" I have described, I feel sceptical!

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I agree with most of what is being said in terms of not judging his \textbf{woman} of course, and when men judge her they are being total hypocrites because they watch porn themselves, but I do want to point out that there are differences between men and women. Women produce more oxytocin during/after orgasm, which binds them emotionally to the male. Men produce less of this hormone.Also, from an evolutionary perspective, men want to spread their seed and women typically do not desire multiple \textbf{sex} partners. So, in a sense, women who do porn may be ..sort of...going against their nature, at least in the beginning.

James simplifies the matter for us greatly in his NT epistle when he notes in James 2:27-28 that there is one "pure religion" \& that is the one that has Christ Jesus as its focus \& submission to Him as its priority while all other religions are deception \& destructive, no matter what pieces of truth they may have in them to make them each seem valid, wholesome, \& worthwhile.

In fact, the Greek word translated "fornication," which is the English word used to denote "\textbf{sexual} intercourse with one to whom one is not married," is porneia. Sounds familiar, doesn't it?

How to Receive Your Heavenly Prayer Language  His Inspirational Gifts:  Manifestation and Church Gift of Divers Kinds ofTongues...1Corinthians 12:4-11  Mark 16:17...Divers kinds of tongues is supernatural utterance by the Holy Spirit in languages never learned by the speaker, notunderstood by the mind of the speaker, nor necessarily always understood by the hearer. Speaking with tongues has \textbf{nothing}whatsoever to do with linguistic ability; it has \textbf{nothing} to do with the mind or the intellect of man. It is a vocal miracle.  Tongues is primarily a devotional gift  Jesus told his disciples, "After the Holy Ghost has come upon you, you shall receive power" (Acts 1:8). The evidence of this baptism isthe gifts of the Spirit, with tongues almost invariably comingfirst. There are various kinds of tongues. One type‚Äîthe prayer and worship language‚Äîis for private use and personal edification. Itdoes not need to be interpreted. In fact, Paul informs us that although he spoke in tongues more often than all the Corinthians,when he did, his understanding was unfruitful. He describes his use of a prayer language as praying "with the spirit" (1 Corinthians14:14-15). This prayer and worship language is indispensable for every Spirit-filled Christian.  Public ministry of tongues  Paul teaches that only a few believers will be used in what we would call the public ministry of tongues, because he said in 1Corinthians 12:30, "do all speak with tongues?" Some take that out of context and say, "Speaking in tongues isn't for everyone. You canbe filled with the Spirit without speaking with tongues." However, we must remember that Paul is talking about the ministry gift oftongues, because he began by saying, "And God hath set some in thechurch...diversities of tongues" (1 Corinthians 12:28). Then Paulasked, "Are all apostles?...do all speak with tongues?" The obvious answer is no. But Paul is talking here about public ministry. Weshould not be too concerned about our ministering in tongues and interpreting. We should be primarily concerned with maintainingtongues in the place where they principally belong‚Äîas a devotional gift to assist us in the worship of God.  Why should I speak in tongues?   Speaking in tongues is initial evidence of Holy Spirit baptism...Acts 2:1-4; 10:44-48; 19:1-6.  Speaks unto God...1 Corinthians 14:2.  Speaks in mysteries...1 Corinthians 14:2.  For spiritual edification...1 Corinthians 14:4.  Build up yourself...Jude 20.  Pray for the unknown--don't know what or how to pray in anysituation...Romans 8:26-27.  Produces rest in our Souls...Isaiah 28:11-12.  Out of your belly shall flow the river of Life...John 7:37-38.  People often ask me why tongues is a \textbf{common} manifestation of baptism in the Holy Spirit. I tell them that if God is going to ruleus, He must certainly rule our tongues; it is our most unruly member. Just as we grab a bit to control a horse, God takes hold ofour tongue to assert His control of us.  Another reason He gives the gift of tongues first is to enable us to build our faith for the appropriation of other spiritualgifts...How are we to appropriate these gifts? Martin Luther tellsus, "Faith is the arm that reaches out to take the gift God offers." But our arm of faith is weak and short. So God's first gift is theonly one that edifies the user. With it, we can build up our arm of faith to appropriate other gifts we may need. That's why whensomeone with a great need comes to me, I find myself instinctively praying in tongues.  Because tongues, above the other gifts, is a worship gift, it helps us fulfill our primary reason for being: to glorify God andenjoy Him.  Folks always ask me, "Do I have to speak in tongues to receive the baptism in the Holy Spirit?" I give them evangelist DavidWilkerson's answer: "You don't have to. You get to. It's part of the package."  How do I speak in tongues?  Instead of telling people to ask for the gift of tongues, I urge them, with the words of the apostle Paul, to "stir up the gift ofGod which is in you" (2 Timothy 1:6).  1. You make the sound by furnishing the raw material. God helps you with the utterance. He helps you shape the sound of your voiceinto words. Acts 2:4 says, "And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gavethem utterance."  2. Don't speak words your mind understands. As long as you do, your mind will remain in control.  3. Don't listen to yourself. Can you imagine a little child learning to talk? Does he say, "Ma-ma-ma-ma," and then stop with: "Ican't say that. That's not a language?" No, he just hugs his daddy's neck and prattles away.  swrc.comRod of God weapon used in New Haven, Taylor Michigan?

You obviously can't pretend you're superior based on merit or achievement when you have neither.Your whole persona and this act that you do makes sense to me now. Though I think you're failing to grasp the fact that you're still going to be the same sad, angry man no matter how much you judge others.

It's not easy to \textbf{transition} from porn star to a regular job. In fact I haven't heard of it happening at all.

Lots of female porn stars admit they love their jobs and it's quick money and no qualifications are needed apart from being open minded sexually. Lots of girls love \textbf{sex} but thankfully most choose not to go down this porn route, instead they use their brains to make money not their bodies. Most girls realise know matter how much they may like \textbf{sex} they are smart enough to know it would be financially rewarding only in the short term not in the long run as they don't often if ever move on to a regular job when the porn work ends. It then leads to poverty and drug abuse and potentially \textbf{sexual} abuse. Some people say not all porn stars are stupid, well smart women don't choose to be porn stars, I don't care how academically smart a few may be they clearly lack foresight and \textbf{common} sense to think working in porn will be good thing.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small saxonsteveYou're clearly not reading it.

Can you think of any example of a man who was elevated to leadership of some cult that didn't end up with a thoroughly warped perspective, \textbf{sexual} deviance and substance abuse, etc? I can't. In fact, the louder these people preach about morality and sin the darker their closets seem to be when they're finally exposed for the frauds they are.The fact that the Bible explicitly mentions Jesus spending time around prostitutes, young men and people with sexually transmitted diseases is telling in itself. The story about the \textbf{woman} at the Pharisees home who kissed Jesus feet, washed them with her hair and perfume, takes on a whole new sensual meaning when you read between the lines and comprehend the sexually deviant nature of a cult leader. You really think he wasn't sexually aroused and intent on intercourse with this beautiful, sinful \textbf{woman} who was licking and massaging his toes? Please. He was male. Surely not even a Christian could be that naive.I suggest you try not just reading the Bible but actually thinking about it. Consider the contexts and connotations involved rather than beginning with the assumption of who you think Jesus was and then accepting the book at face value.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I believe devil exist in mind. Maybe a state of mind like depression which a pron star can end up in easily. When a young \textbf{woman} chooses to get money the hard way by not doing porn, she is just avoiding that future depression that can come out of that profession. At this point she is not sure that depression wont come out of another profession but chances are pretty low compared to being a porn star. That mentality to take hardship at present by caring about future is something that gets respects from society and that respect makes sense as that mentality is what takes us forward as a species. Now when a religious man respects that mentality, he might use words like "not selling soul to devil" but if you are ready to not get too much into the syntax, even those are wise words... but then an atheist cant help as his primary sense of having an elevated conversation is to keep proving the non existence of god and devil.. even in a porn stars interview..

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Just let her be her. Some women are \textbf{nothing} more then fuck dolls for us.  Just like how women use super rich men for their money. Some men are so ugly by the time they get rich....all girls want is their money.So it's ok.  Hookers and prostitutes have been around since civilization started. Before that.....rape and pillaging was very \textbf{common}.It's 2018.  If they want to be whores and be fucked by lots of men on film.....then go ahead.  They are fuck dolls.  Everyone of us would cum on their face without hesitation but 99.9 of us would never fucking have a baby with these whores.I mean come on.  if they have kids.....their kids will see those porn videos sooner or later.  So either those kids will grow up being disgusted or might turn out to be huge fucking whores as well.  That's just life.I mean if you want everyone to see your gaping \textbf{pussy} and butthole then you have some issues or money problems.No normal person would think it's a good idea. For all you guys who disagree...go ahead and make a video of yourself fingering your asshole and see how your life goes.  Cause a video of a guy fucking a girl is \textbf{nothing} compared to a girl being gang banged by a bunch of guys who just wants to leave a load inside that girl.Lets be real here. A lot of people would pay 500\$ to fuck these porn stars, but we would never fucking take these whores home or anywhere UNLESS you are one of those cuckold who is fine with seeing someone cum inside his wife ect.These women will have to deal with a lifetime of shame once their kids grow up.  I mean what's worse then growing up and one day seeing a video of your mom getting gang banged by 10+ guys. lmfaoThese porn stars should just keep on making videos and shut the fuck up.One of these days prostitution will be legal and maybe they will get more respect.Most of these girls have fucking problems if they are porn stars at \textbf{age} 18-25 or whatever.when you're 35+ and go through a divorcee and have grown kids..you can do whatever the fuck you want.  That's different.A 18 year \textbf{old} girl who gets into porn OBVIOUSLY had a very rough childhood.I know a girl who is 22 now and she is such a whore.  She wanted to do porn but idk what happened. It didnt work out i guess.Anyways, i remember her mom always talking about \textbf{sex} and she talks about fucking her boyfriend like guys talk about sports.I just knew her daughter was going to grow up being a whore. Ive known her since she was 14ish and the moment she was 16.....she fucked almost everyone who wanted to fuck.  fucking was talked about by her mom constantly, so of course it would be a normal subject. THE DAUGHTER learns from her mother.  lolMost of these girls have problems and they are being used to make money.I'm not complaining. I just think it's so fucking funny how these porn stars think they matter. The way they talk....Bitch, everyone wants to fuck you and dump a load in you, but they don't want to kiss you. trust me.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Common, Nothing, Old, Sex, pussy & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Age - Youngsters, Gender - General, Nationality - Chinese, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}7/561 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.248 \\  \hline

Not by having more experience... A fact that all those pornstars would never teach young women. In a relationship, its not about what one does, but what they do both. If you have an equivalent amount of efforts, time spent for the other, money invested, thoughts (romance)... whilst both of the partners being two independant individuals... You get the most stable power couple there is.

And if its something she loves doing and the guy brings it up as a solution that goes against what she enjoys: WELL WHAT THE HELL DID YOU EXPECT? LMAO.

Its much harder for a man to get some attention from the right women. For a \textbf{woman} in her prime (\textbf{sexual} peak: \textbf{age} and appearance-wise) its all offered. Respecting yourself means to choose your partners and learn from your mistakes. If your answer to that is: go in the \textbf{sex} industry because you have that prime given to you, but pour money on your looks enlessly... you're bound to never understand the reality that relationships are worth something and normal people Build them through time. You cant expect someone to trust you upfront and being asked to get tested is Not normal. Its criminal to give a disease to someone. Hello??? Criminal.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small You are being very shortsighted.  \textbf{Sexual} Relationships were meant for reproduction and even if you take the biblical view of things, monogamy wasn't the default position.  But I can show you that marriage according to god's plan assuming you are a Christian, end badly at rate higher than documented Porn marriages and divorces.  There's not a lot of data on the subject but you seem to be implying that porn stars only get involved in relationships with other porn stars.  Many get married to people that aren't in the business.For marriages and relationships that go according to God's plan, there's a lot of infidelity, physical abuse and \textbf{mental} abuse. Seems like God's plan doesn't really have much to do with whether a relationship goes well or not one way or the other.  And IDK what your view is on \textbf{G\textbf{ay}} Marriage, but many Christians claim that same \textbf{sex} marriage goes against God's law citing essentially two verses from a text they never read the original version of from languages they can't read for themselves. But that said, there are plenty of very happy \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} marriages and divorce rates are lower than that of 'traditional marriage'. I'll be intellectually honest enough to point out that you can't make factual claims when the samples you are comparing are very different (porn professionals are an absolutely tiny part of the population, and if you are holding that \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} marriage goes against God's plan, gays tend toward 10-15 of the population, in both cases, they are groups much smaller than heterosexuals who get married).  But your claim is that relationship god doesn't approve of will go to sh*t.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Before I say anything else, let me just make this clear:Most people don't want to marry anyone who is an \textbf{o\textbf{ld} h\textbf{ag}},porn-star or no porn-star! Why are we talking about \textbf{old} hags?You just took whatever point you had, and through it out the window there.Now back to the first thing you said, Harry Potter,I assume you mean their general relationships with people in general.Because there's no such thing as "Porn Relationships"as "live to create to live" had said it in the beginning.My point is:There is Porn, and then there is Relationships.They are two totally different things!  One is quite an interesting type of job,that some people obviously like to do.  And one is about beingstrongly connected with someone,with the addition of \textbf{sexual} feelings for them.Porn is not some form of dating!God! Go find yourself a dictionary!It has actually, \textbf{nothing} at all, to do with relationships!Of course, it may very well effect the type of people you date,but as "live to create to live" had put it, it is just simply inaccurate.You know what I'm saying, like dude, seriously,what the hell is a Porn Relationship? That's not a thing!Sorry to brake it to you! (not sorry, though)"PornSTAR relationships" on the other hand,the way you, Harry Potter, said it, is quite different.All that means is: Relationships that porn-stars have.Now you are talking about something real.And now that we're speaking English,lets discuss what you say, shall we.You go on to say "...never work out"To that I say: I don't haveexperience with them,so I can't say for sure,but I do think at leastsome of them work out.Maybe not in the same way as you and I would have.You know, like, they're probably more willingto accept that level of openness in their relationship.And other similar differences of sorts.But at the end of the day, it is a relationship.And with whomand for whatever level of opennessand for however long they decided toand for however long it lastsand for whatever other features yata...yata....bla..bla..etc.,it works!  At the end of the day, all said and done, it works!How often, and for what percent of them?Hey look man, I don't know.I haven't taken a proper surveyof every single one of them.But to just assume that they "never work out",I mean, you just don't know that.And as a second point,who said that they want a relationship anyways?Maybe they're perfectly happy with their way of life.You really don't know that they're all living miserable lives.Again, unless you have spoken to every single one of them,you just don't know that, to be the case.       Now, do I think it's a smart path to take? No. I definitely do not!But like I said in my previous comment above,it really doesn't seem to bother me.It's their life, and it doesn't affect anyone.Well, besides the people who choose to watch it,and in that case, it is only affecting themIN THE WAY OF THEIR CHOOSING,so that is still not the porn-stars problem.What?Are you gonna tell me they're forcing you to watch the stuff?I don't think so. So why would you have a problem with it?      On the other hand, for me, seeing such a character asshown by Joaquin Phoenix in the movie Walk The Linewas, for some reason, greatly disturbing to me.Even to the point that I was asked to leave the room,as I could not handle his horrible character,in regards to his marriage and women.So clearly, I do get bothered by disturbing behaviors and character.But people deciding to live their personal life as a porn-star,you know, for some reason, it doesn't seem to bother me, not at all.Maybe you can see the difference here. I think I can.      Now if porn really bothers you that much,then I recommend that you stop watching it!And if you were not watching it, then my question is:What the hell does it have to do with you?It's their life and it don't affect anyone, so why the hell do you care?(obliviously, I'm not talking to you Harry Potter, as you don't seem that bothered)(I'm probably referring, more so, to the original comment by "live to create to live") \normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Hag, Nothing, Old, Old hag, Sexual & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Age - Youngsters, Gender - Female age and physical appearance, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}6/762 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.787 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Tiara Le'que  You are quite correct except for identifying  what I said as "opinion." Allow me to explain. Everyone is in fact looking for love and genuine affection.  But what we are engaging in is fun, recreation, and instant gratification. Women are the biggest targets and victims of this. Only as long as you get what you want you don't see it, or just dismiss it because your so caught up in the euphoria of self indulgence. Women more so than men don't see themselves as what they sincerely are in modern day relationships. They are fuck puppets, playthings, cum receptacles, \textbf{sex} toys, etc, etc. it is because that is what they want to be. Which is their choice and I am not issuing reprimand to women for that. It is their right to exercise their free will as they please.  Women in their view of female empowerment and independence proudly engage in this lifestyle  \textbf{blind} to its reality. This is inclusive of serial affairs, long term relationships, boyfriends, hook ups, booty calls, one night stands, any relationship structure you can name. Including marriage. I'm not trying to define all relationships this way. However I  being honest in my observation, women for the most part have surrendered themselves to living as though they are \textbf{nothing} more than a mound of flesh with an expiration date. As well they foolishly believe that they have somehow reversed the roles where they are now choosing the men and men are lucky to be chosen. Then we get to the eventual desire for the substance of a relationship.  Love, a partnership, and a life together. In reality, there is no love in the life we are living today. That is why this hurts women more so than it could ever hurt men. What makes you think you are going to find love when you began having \textbf{sex} at 15 and by the time your thirty your in double digits with the number of dicks that have been in you? You may... I'm not ruling it out, but how do you think think you can now determine what is special?That brings us to my previous comment.  I sincerely don't hold any animosity to the girl in the video, or women at all. But I recognize that women have a different view of themselves than what the present as who they want to be perceived as. If not to all then in general as to themselves as a \textbf{woman}  They have to in order to live the way they do without revealing themselves as porn stars like the girl in the video. You cannot honestly say you want love, partnership and a life together with someone when you're throwing everything you would have for that someone out to someone else, or many others. You can't by reason but despite what would be reason the vast majority of women are. I used to think  I should respect women a great deal and many times I believed I was meeting someone special. Only to discover that more often, in fact always, the women were just like the \textbf{woman} in this video. There just wasn't a camera on them when they did it. The wanted me to see them differently because I was not the "bad boy" or "type"  they were willing to reveal themselves in this manner to. However for whatever their motivation I wasn't written out of their lives completely. (I still like the girls whom did write me off) but now seeing women for who are what they really are, much like the girl in this video, I see no reason to have all that respect for them since from my perspective they have no self respect anyway. Thus now instead of thinking, about the possibility of getting to know her and building a relationship I immediately rule that out. I see women as the fuck puppets they deliver themselves as. Other than my view of women I have not changed from the man I was when I held women in higher regard.  So women might draw  a distinction between me and another "type" or a "bad boy" thinking that they'll reserve me for friendship or the later possibility of a relationship. I instead think.. I would date her but I have no interest in love. She is a fuck puppet to me , just as she has chosen to be to so many others anyway. So it's not with hatred or dismissing her humanity that I made that remark. It is with education as to the world I now live in.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Tiara Le'que You are correct in viewing my perspective as not being fair. It is not meant to be. I have that perspective given the current nature of relationships in order to be fair to myself. I see that as the only effective way to insure my own success and level of comfort. However let me try to clarify what you continue to state as my "opinion."If I were to make an observation of teenage girls today vs an observation of their grandmother or great grandmother as teens those observations in general would be drastically different. Just the term "spreading your legs" would be extremely offensive to previous generations of young teens. I'm not stating young girls are bad. However being on birth control before you can come home after dark, having a supply of condoms in your purse "just in case," and having a boyfriend almost non stop from 15 on is an incredible distinction from aforementioned generations. Being so different it also establishes a different overall perspective of you. That is what I am acknowledging. I am not judging it. I am just acknowledging the status we live in now. Perhaps young teen girls would find that being described as their great-grandmother as a teen to be more favorable than to be described as they are now. But that observation doesn't get assigned to you just because you are a female and it's more flattering. We are what we are and it is what it is. I am not offering an opinion on it of any kind. I am just acknowledging... observing and articulating what is before me to see. Of course I understand that women have the same perspective of men that I have of women. That is exactly what I am addressing when I state that relationships now are based on \textbf{sexual} recreation, fantasy fulfillment, immediate gratification and etc. With Tinder, and the match up sites, the phenomenal success of the "bad boy" with even professional women. What you have acknowledged with that question and observation is some of the proof that what I have stated is fact... not opinion.Perhaps I need to be more clear. I am not saying that women are fuck puppets. I am stating that in our time relationships sexually based. Built on the desire to satiate a \textbf{sexual} craving, fantasy, immediate gratification, perverse desire, anything but a real bond, a purpose other than \textbf{sexual} gratification. Thus women are fuck puppets in the structure of the relationship. This is something that is hard to accept as I am certain it is not the desired position or status a \textbf{woman} wants. However she does not have to embrace this title to be the definition of one. If she participates in this she is one within the structure whether or not she accepts the title. It's like being no. 55 at the registry of motor vehicles. You are not Tiara Le'que in the registry. That is who you know yourself as but in that registry you are no. 55. You are no.55 no matter how you wish to see it and you will be no.55 until you are no longer participating in events at the registry. I am not defining women as or appointing women the title of "fuck puppets." What I am saying is that if someone changes that title to "girlfriend," "booty call," "wife." "hook-up," or any other title and you fulfill that role then that is what your are in that relationship because that is the role you are playing. I don't know how to answer you about your relationship that ended. Let me use my own words to repeat to you what you just told me. You said that you had a relationship (dating) with a guy whom you were sexually involved with. (Not stated but implied in your last line) Perhaps you always saw him as a perspective life partner (can't tell from what you stated) but certainly after some time you did. You then expressed yourself to him. Upon doing this your discovered his sentiments were quite inconsistent with yours. Would it be unreasonable to say his perspective of being with you was the exact opposite? I am going to say this.. and I sincerely hope you understand that I am being completely objective and I hope establishing a prerequisite for my comment allows you to forgive any offense. You did not choose to be a fuck puppet. However you fulfilled the role of one. According to you... you entered a relationship that had no other purpose than for \textbf{sexual} gratification. Even if it was not your intent, clearly it was his. The evidence of that is how your relationship ended. Please if you disagree then tell me what the educated you through this experience can salvage from this relationship to define it otherwise. When I use the term "fuck puppet" it is not to insult women. It's not pleasant I admit, but it is to identify the role not to insult anyone, Dani Daniels embraces her role as a fuck puppet. (at least as she appears to the general public)  Like I said to you earlier, if you fill that role, that is what you are. Like if you get a job as a bus driver, then you are a bus driver. Not being flattered by the title you may say..."I have a job driving a bus, but I am not a bus driver, that's what I do not who I am." However as long as you fulfill that role, like it or not, you are a bus driver. There are women who embrace that role of fuck puppet not because they acknowledge the title/role but because of the euphoria or what they are doing and/or who they are with. Those are the women who chose to be fuck puppets even if they don't acknowledge the role/title. But I mean no inset to them either. I am not ruling out men. It just doesn't have the same effect on men as it does women. Men don;t want to date a girl after someone else. They don't want "sloppy seconds" or to "clean up" after their friends or rival for your affections. If a man is willing to date you knowing he's the follow up guy he is likely just looking to get his turn at bat. I have been a man all my life, I know this is indisputable truth. On constrast I have seen women all my life all take turns dating the same guy. Even if a boyfriend cheats on a girls best friend with her she'll still date him. Then he'll do the same thing to her with her new best friend and the new best friend will date him. Women have a different perspective of men altogether than men have of women, That is why i said earlier this hurts women more then men. If women are or were fuck puppets for the most part they have to deceive men into believing they never were. Men can run right into home plate (marriage) celebrating all his conquest. That is because women accept it, not because it's different when a man does it. I know not every one is focused on being fuck puppets. But it does not matter what you desire to be if you fall into or willingly step into that role. If you fulfill it, that is what you are. I for one admit that I now wish to be a \textbf{woman}'s fuck puppet rather than seek a relationship I have stated why in previous comment to you. I was once what it appears that you wanted the guy you were dating to be. I wasn't rejected because I did anything wrong or provide to be the wrong guy. I was rejected because I did not do anything wrong, I wasn't a bad boy, wasn't the "type." (Type: the ambiguous description to justify or deny without substance) This reply has been far more lengthier than any I have ever posted. It is because I don't want you to take the "fuck puppet" remark personally or with insult. I wanted to explain where I was coming from and you seem to understand that. A man won't say "fuck puppet" to you, it will obviously offend you if he did, But being a man all my life I can tell you ... If a man doesn't have to love you, have a life goal with you, and a purpose grater that \textbf{sexual} gratification ... he won't. Most of my life I did it wrong because it is clear that is not what women have wanted as long as I have been alive, I just have no desire to be the type of man (the bad boy) that women are so willing to be the \textbf{sexual} gratification for. But now I'm noticing that to young girls I can be myself and being older still hanging with the young make me a "bad boy' to them. Every \textbf{woman} in my life is a Dani Daniel. There just isn't enough of them.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Sexual, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}8/1518 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.527 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Tiara Le'que You are not a fuck puppet. When you looking the mirror you are not a fuck puppet. You have a desire for something greater than to be a \textbf{sex} toy for someone. You express a greater interest for yourself than to present or establish yourself for recreational \textbf{sex}. But to a man who has no intention of having a relationship with you with mutual interest but engage in \textbf{sex} with you, to him, you are a fuck puppet. I have a question for you about that. In general or specifically to you... if you ginuely consciously have those goals/interest how do you end up having \textbf{sex} with a man whom does not? A fuck puppet is just a synonym for "whore" defined by (and I'll use the definition of the word in it's etymology, not the current dictionary definition)  a \textbf{woman} who has \textbf{sex} outside of marriage, [NOTE: etymology is a word derived from the Greek word ·ºêœÑœÖŒºŒøŒªŒøŒ≥ŒØŒ±  meaning "true sense", and the suffix -logia, denoting "the study of". In linguistics, the term etymon is used to refer to a word or morpheme  from which a later word is derived. The word "whore" has been redefined so much that the original definition has been intentionally altered of lost. There was no male equivalent as the word was to specifically define a \textbf{woman} by her actions. Men who did the same were defined as "whore mongers" as they sought to engage a whore sexually.]You appear to understand me with but one exception. You think I define every \textbf{woman} or every \textbf{woman} who has \textbf{sex} a fuck puppet. Just like I defined "whore" I am defining what one is. If you fulfill that definition then that is what you are by that definition.  Whore is a real word with a history. It's not easy to find the etymology of a word but if you desire to confirm what I say you can. It goes further back than the German definition that will immediately come up in a google search. It dates all the way back to Biblical history. This is the best I could find in short research:  [LINK]  When I learned the history long ago it was in books. "Fuck Puppet" is slang, modern vernacular. But both words are descriptive to behavior. In other words they only apply if you fulfill their definition.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Sex, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}10/395 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.532 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I'm sorry +Tiara Le'que sincerely, however no updates will be coming. When the truth is unpleasant it is impossible to say it in a pleasant manner. I sincerely never meant any insult, just observation.I believe women in general, or in \textbf{common} mindset of the conventional wisdom, visualize themselves as being no different than their great grandmothers or her mother before that with the only difference being that they are not restricted by codes of conduct forced upon them by men. The problem with their thinking is that women are not self evaluating. The result is that in their minds women create a persona they want us as men to see that is not who they are. At least Dani Daniels doesn't present a facade, but then that is because she cannot hide who she is.I understand the reason women don't recognize who they are. Dani Daniels explains it well. However not acknowledging it doesn't make it non existent. Ignoring reality only results in being crushed by it when the imaginary/facade cannot support you any longer. That is what happens to women when they, as you characterized it, get their insides ripped out by men. Men don't have the burden of needing to present a facade of who they are. Women welcome the worst men could be. Somehow in women's mind they can embrace the worst of a man and either turn him into the best or change themselves to find pleasure in the worst. Whatever, as I said to you before, women accept it therefore men are rewarded by it so they do it. Men have no desire of a male version of feminism because men have always be satisfied and rewarded well for being a man. Women want to be free to express themselves as women without consequence. Believe it or not I support that. GOD made \textbf{nothing} dirty. Including a \textbf{woman}'s body, it's appeal, and the \textbf{sexual} desire she has. All that is perverted by man. (the mind of mankind) So I am not critical a a \textbf{woman}'s desired \textbf{sex} life no matter what it is. My criticism is what women do in living a dual life with the pretense that it is not. One of fantasy, self indulgence and excess, the other substance. The problem is the fantasy, self indulgence and excess leaves \textbf{nothing} for the substance. Where it is perfectly okay for you to walk this path, by your own culpable and intelligent consciousness, it cannot be made into something other than what it is. Being what it is you have no more power to create a new reality for it than I do for any decision I make. Whether or not I am culpable, intelligent and conscious or not. So even if it is not your intent, it still is what it is. I spent too much time in the side of wanting to see things differently. I had a more palatable concept of the human female, that concept was formed by feminism. A concept that simply recreates and redefines women removing personal accountability from them. Keeping in relation to this discussion.... in feminism if you conduct yourself as a whore/fuck puppet you are not a whore/fuck puppet. How can you be a whore/fuck puppet and not be a whore/fuck puppet? Just don't accept THE definition of a whore/fuck puppet. Create a definition for yourself. The reason I abandoned that "respect" for women is because my experience taught me that women had no respect for it, or the men who respected them. Had they that respect then they would not, could not make the decisions they were making. It is also why I feel no guilt now having \textbf{sex} with women with absolutely no desire for a meaningful relationship, no interest in love and certainly no prospect for marriage. I am not alone, not even a minority. Look at all the videos on youtube under the subject that men are abandoning marriage. I think all the psychoanalysis is bullshit but it does reveal that men have lost interest in the substance of a relationship between a man and a \textbf{woman}. I think all their evaluation is pure psychobabble as to explain the reasons why. I believe the reason why is the very issue you and I have been discussing.Men have never wanted a whore/fuck puppet. Nowhere in history, no matter what era or culture you study do you see where whores, however defined for that time, were any thing of value to their society other than playthings, \textbf{sex} toys, \textbf{sex} slaves, or something of similar definition. That is whether they were chained, paid, or volunteered. In all honesty I do not know what the women of this era see or experience that makes them believe it will be any different for them. It's not like women were not sought for the substance of a relationship, its the whore/fuck puppet that was not. My concept of the human female has changed. It has changed from the the concept women (feminist) taught me to have to the one education and experience revealed to me. It will not change until education and experience provide a lesson that reveals what I have learned now is false. However when you consider that most of my life I have been rejected or offered affections only from women who believing no one else wanted them I was desperate for them to now I'm not even asking and women are coming to me. That's going to be a difficult task for education and experience deliver upon.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Common, Nothing, Sex, Sexual, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Gender - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}9/926 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.972 \\  \hline

Knowing someone intimately is one of the cool things about a relationship. Like she/he could have chosen anyone, but they chose me.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Nothing. Porn stars and all other prostitutes  have to have an "open relationship" or none at all.  Then the main relationship is distinguished by the amount of time spent working on it and in it  vs. the little time, usually only a few hours a day spent strictly whoring their body for money in \textbf{sexual} acts. Just screwing a person, even if it's John Holmes with a 14 inch schlong as thick as a beer can around, does not constitute a deep relationship, no matter how much better he can pound it senseless than the average dude with a 5 or 6 inch pecker.  The problem is that most dudes don't know how to operate their equipment well or nowhere near THAT well and feel threatened since most dudes don't have much going on in the "relationship" department either. If the relationship was deep enough then regular fugging might be "as good" as being plowed by a man-horse. Otherwise, few guys are secure enough to risk a 10 inch or longer dick possibly making them look like total amateurs and stealing every last women from them without the stud ever having to speak more than a few sentences. Just his dick alone speaks volumes for him while the regular guy's dick is a short story and needs lots of outside embellishments in terms of "quality time" spent together to measure up.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nothing, Sexual & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/231 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.866 \\  \hline

Let me clarify what I've said. Young men have a strong urge to impregnate the maximum of women, so depending on their personality, they can have \textbf{sex} with little bonding.... that's true for teenage boys and boys in college. After that, most men look for intimacy more than just \textbf{sex}. As for women, they are biologically designed to bond with their \textbf{sexual} partner. That's why women have a very hard time sleeping with a lot of partners, and that's why female pornstars and prostitutes end up broken and mentally unstable.

I also prefer to sleep naked because my anus needs lots of ventilation at night due to my extreme flatulence problem. I don't know why laying in a prone position makes me have gas.You also need to know one other thing. If your going to be my girlfriend, you'll have to share me with other women. I'm not monogamous at all. I usually have some of the \textbf{old} Church ladies come down into the Church basement and perform fellatio on me. But you don't have to be there when that goes on. You can leave so we can have some privacy. You'll be able to come and go as you please. The only people who have a key to the Church basement is the General Sinott and myself. But I can have a spare key made for you if you promise not to bring anybody else into the Church.That reminds me of a close call I had a few months ago. I was in my room in the Church basement and one of the older Church ladies was performing fellatio on me and the General Sinott started coming downstairs and almost caught us. The \textbf{old} lady had to put her dentures back in real fast and act like \textbf{nothing} unusual was happening. You see, I always have the \textbf{old} ladies remove their dentures before performing oral on me because that way I don't have to worry about their teeth hurting my foreskin.

Not to mention the world of men/boys jacking off to your wife and seeing everything about her... it isn't a 'normal' thing to expect a man to be ok with his wife doing that crap.Open relationships are sick and twisted... if you do it for physical pleasure only then fine, but to expect a husband and a wife with an 'open' relationship to work is asinine.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Sex, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/125 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.6 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Bitch please, she isn't doing porn cause she needs money anymore. Overtime you get enough money to quit. The only reason why she is doing it is cause she is a low life piece of trash that gets off of cucking her husband. Males are dominant in nature, which is why you see more polyamoric relationships with 1 man and several women rather than 1 \textbf{woman} and several man. If you have problems, blame evolution and how different genders are biologically wired.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Nothing but respect, but it's just kind of funny. Because she says that people or "civilians" would get jealous about the person that they love having \textbf{sex} with a bunch of people daily. But when she dates a performer she also gets jealous because the person that she loves is fucking somebody else. It's stuck in a never ending never resolving bind .. \textbf{Sex} is way better when it's love. I think that everybody has had a one night stand and felt kind of like shit afterwards. I don't judge because I have had a lot of \textbf{sex} partners but as a guy and the \textbf{woman} that I love is having \textbf{sex} with a bunch of guys daily, not to mention they would be twice the size of you which any man would get very insecure. It would be like Dani and I are dating, and I am a porn star and she's not. And all the porn stars that I am fucking have way bigger tits, and look way hotter than she does. Well of course it's going to eventually really bugged her that I'm doing that ..
