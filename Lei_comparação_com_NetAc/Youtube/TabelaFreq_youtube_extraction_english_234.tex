  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I've gotta admit that my parents are so \textbf{racist} too! And I can't really blame them cause it's integrated in the culture like you said.. They are 100 convinced that all other human beings aren't as loved by Allah as they are, for example they say Asians are dirty and disgusting cause they eat dogs and Indians are disgusting cause they worship cows... etc and each time I start arguing with them about such things they bash me off and start treating me as if I was a Kafira that I'm trying to be open-minded and it's against Allah's rules. I'm sick of trying to the point where I don't even want to argue anymore, I'll let them think the way they think and I feel blessed to not be ignorant about this.The bigger problem is the fact that the majority of Arabs are like this that's why we aren't developed and we still have wars and conflicts, I'm not optimistic about this cause the society is so messed up they don't teach love but rather hatred and division.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/180 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.556 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small In our Noble Qur'an, Allah [s.w.t] had already addressed the issue of 'racial superiority' in which THE CONTEXT is in the following verse:'Say, O you who are Jews [ applicable to any \textbf{race} ], if you [ verily ] claim that you are favoured  chosen by Allah with the exclusion of the rest of mankind, then [ why don't you ] desire death if you are indeed truthful.' [ Qur'an Surah Al-Jumu'ah: 62:6 ]For anyone who needs further explanation on why Allah [s.w.t] explicitly said '.... then [ why don't you ] desire death if you are indeed truthful' is because, in the minds of the 'Chosen People of Superiority,' they believe that just for being 'Chosen and Superior,' Allah [s.w.t] have already reserved Jannah [ i.e. paradise  heaven ] for them. Well, if they are indeed truthful, shouldn't they have the sincere desire to go straight to Jannah [ rather than stay in this world ] ?? They are the 'Chosen People of Superiority' after all. But nope! Never will they admit to this because they know they are arrogantly living in their own delusion of superiority which they themselves claimed. Even Allah [s.w.t] NEVER claimed anybody to be superior.LASTLY, FOR THE DELUDED 'CHOSEN PEOPLE OF SUPERIORITY,' ALL OF THE THINGS I'VE SAID ABOVE, ALL OF THE INFORMATION IS THERE IN THE NOBLE QUR'AN, HENCE ALL OF THIS ARE FROM ALLAH'S [ S.W.T ] WORD.

The \textbf{racism} and decrimination is so much. Being \textbf{black}, I'm looked down upon by everyone of every \textbf{race} including my own for being dark skinned. It amazes me how much Arabs here especially those from sham(Syria,Palestine,Lebanon, and Jordan) always ask people in the masjid to pray for their country as we are all Muslims but would not want to stand next to me for salah.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I agree with this! Thank you for promoting this mentality. Cultural superiority and this kind of "tribal identity" thing has been the cause of so much conflict. There's \textbf{nothing} wrong with being proud of your culture but you shouldn't let it make you look at others as below you. Also, not to offend anyone, but at the time before Islam, the ignorance was rampant among Arab tribes. The \textbf{Quran} literally calls it Jahiliyyah, or the Period of Ignorance/Paganism. Worshiping idols, burying their daughters alive, etc. The Prophet (s.a.w.) and the \textbf{Quran} were sent to correct them and "perfect their character (akhlaq)". So I think it's inaccurate for Arabs to feel superior for having Islam revealed to their people. It's a beautiful language and a beautiful culture, but again, not inherently better than everyone else.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nothing, Quran & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Religious Identity - Muslim & \cellcolor{green!5}3/134 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.239 \\  \hline

Among hispanics they idolize fair skin and talk among themselves about who's white in the family. It's everywhere. But I always thought it's might just be a preference most people have of what they admire. Not so much a \textbf{race} thing.I say that because men like Tom Cruise sell at the box office and all races come to see him or men and women like him.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Race & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/117 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.855 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Well I have an \textbf{Indian} friend in uni, in the U.K, who lived in Saudi for most of her life before doing 2 years medical boarding school in India after and moving here. She said Saudi is the best and when she lived in India she loved it too but she didn't feel fully equal to her \textbf{Indian} friends because they view Islam and Arab culture as backwards, ugly and non-progressive or non-beneficial to the world compared to \textbf{Indian} culture. She had no Muslim friends, she truly didn't fit in anywhere, her own \textbf{ethnic} place or her own religions place. Her dad was a doctor and some of his lazy untalented colleagues (yes Arab) would ask them to do some of their shifts time to time with no pay, he would be depressed but can't say anything because human rights and equality exists less there. She said the people there seem to lack intelligence, more lazy, apparently their king or something doesn't even have his personal doctor as Saudi/Arab, he is south asian, which is \textbf{crazy}, as it shows he doesn't really believe in his people's capabilities. At least we work hard for our successes and stay humble, and not rely on natural resources or faking our way through. It's embarrassing. Like without it, I feel like everyone knows the country would still be the squalid undeveloped, medieval-minded place it was before. It saved them man it really did and those arabs (I know not all of them are like that) are undeserving of it in my honest opinion, it's a waste. Imagine all the good other countries that need help would've done with it. I hope they realise that and get off their high horse and come back down to reality, because outside the UAE etc they are \textbf{nothing}. It's pathetic and cringey. I've only met like two in my life, both good people and not fit the horrible descriptions people give them.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Here's a place you might start in defeating your "arab superiority", realizing you're probably not "arab". Arabia is a place. If you weren't born there, which you weren't, then you're not an Arab. In your case, your ancestors weren't even Arab's. Palestinians are largely SEMITES, descended from biblical SHEM. They were invaded by Arabs and so there is some Arabic heritage there in Palestine. But just because you were born in Palestine doesn't mean you're descended from arabs. It's a big mix now of Arab offspring plus Semitic offspring that people's Palestine and I wouldn't doubt even that there's bunches of more people types in Palestine than just semites and arabs. If you want to do some research on it you might google this term: "Haplo-types of Palestine", then take each haplogroup you find listed and do additional research on each of those haplotypes and figure out what their migratory route was and what cultures each of those haplotypes were part and then you'll have a real good idea of where the people of Palestine are from.It's \textbf{weird} that Palestine is largely peopled by Semitic Muslims, ay? But it's true.Provisionally, I did the search and came up with these people types as all being part of the population of Palestine: Persians, Turkish, Macedonians (Hitites), Egyptians, Italians, East Africans, South Africans, Greeks, Spaniards, Portugese, French, Moroccans, Berbers... None of which are from The Arabian Peninsula. So the odds are greatest that you're no part Arab, even if you're born in Palestine, where for years the \textbf{lame} media has been pushing the narrative that there's a split between Arabs and Jews. It's just hokey nonsense being sold by the billionaires who like to create division to use in conquering people for the purpose of THIEVERY, stealing their property and the minerals that are buried in it.If you want to REALLY KNOW your heritage, get a DNA test, I recommend Family Tree DNA as they'll test for your genetic haplotype. Other "genetic testing facilities" make claims to know where you're from, which they can not possibly. So avoid any genetic test that is making claims about the region or place of your ancestry. You can know it if you know where your family is from, but they can't know it by testing your genes. So don't believe the fraud. But get your genes tested by a genetic testing facility that reports your HAPLOTYPE and then do the research on your own as to what MIGRATIONS your GENETIC HAPLOTYPE has endured. You should recognize in those \textbf{common} migrations someplace where you've been told your family is from.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Common, Lame, Weird & \cellcolor{green!5}Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}3/436 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.688 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small No brother, you are wrong. Europeans have always been looking to us, there is a reason Britain left us with monarchs in Egypt and Iraq. They wanted to implement a government that leans in their favor, so while they don't directly administer these countries, we are still under their heavy influence. You are right, some of this stuff is self-imposed. It wasn't a Brit who poisoned Gamel Abdel Nasser, it was an Egyptian, our own people, betraying our beloved Gamel Abdel Nasser, just like that. But in fact, it is somewhat to blame of our colonizers, they were the one's who left us with these weak forms of government. Look what it cost us in the long run, if Britian would just mind their own business, none of this would have probably happened. ISIL had \textbf{nothing} to do with Europeans?

Indeed they do depend on the west, but they are also diversifying their economies to brace for the price fall when oil begins becoming rare. Women are oppressed, although if your taking about Hijab I think you should know that majority Saudi men wear Kufiya a lot. I didn't know that they stopped cutting people's hands off, it's disgusting that they ever thought of doing so, something so barbaric, so uncivilized. I didn't beg anyone for help, no one is helping out the Egyptians, no one has helped out the Egyptians. I'm not putting the entire blame on the Brits, French or Italians, even the Spanish took some of the Arab world (*ahem ahem* western Sahara) but it wasn't us who implemented these weak monarchs. We were also lied to and left alone when the Sauds invaded Hejaz, allowing them to spread their strict interpretation of Islam. We couldn't stop them, what could we do? We can't fix our countries when they are run by foolish and horrible leader's. Name one good thing that Hosni Mubarak has ever done. Eastern Europe is better than us because they were able to successfully able to implement a good government system. We can't do that because we are confused and divided, we just keep starting conflicts, when will they stop? How do we even stop them? I mean, look at Iraq. In a couple years, probably a decade or so, it'll probably be better than it's ever been. Why? A good and stable government. But what do you expect us to do in Egypt? We've lost our chance to do anything, protesting won't help. I'm sure what really we could do here. Communism and dictatorship in both South and North Yemen have have severely damaged the two countries, the dictatorship still went on even into the newly unified Yemeni state. But then the Arab spring came along and just triggered a civil war, now what do they do? Europe is doing great because even before the two wars they were great major powers, those conflicts and wars have passed on. But we are still dealing with conflict, war, and bad government. Arab countries like Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco are okay because they managed to go on without conflict, but look at Libya, they are in a civil war, how do you expect them to develop in this situation. Syria, Libya, and Yemen are in civil war. Iraq and Lebanon just recently came out of a civil war. Lebanon and Jordan are dealing with a \textbf{refugee} crisis, they are not rich countries like Britian or Germany, they cannot as easily combat this.Egypt is dealing with a horrible military dictatorship.

I don't know anyone who has married their cousins, but while it may be seen as taboo in the west, it's not in other places. I'm really not sure about here, because I don't know anyone who's married their cousin.

Islam says \textbf{nothing} of joining ISIL, almost everything ISIL is doing is haram. Suicide is haram, rape is also haram.

Whether you are Muslim or not, this should be \textbf{common} sense. Good on Tajikistan, there is no where saying women have to cover their heads, wear burqa's or hijabs. But they've done more then simply ban burqa's for cultural preservation, the president has done some things to restrict Muslim belief, and for a country that is over 90 muslim. Iran is still a Islamic theocracy where 99.99 of the population is Muslim, some Iranians teens becoming lax or atheists doesn't mean anything.  Actually, incest is very haram, tons of hadith (sunnah) is highly incorrect, and the prophet Muhammad peace and blessings be upon him never married his cousin, actually, it was his cousin which married his daughter. That's not incest, and his cousin was much younger then him. ISIL should know what their doing is haram, just because some hooligans running around in guns, spreading violence, claiming their doing good in the Islam, does not automatically mean that these people are following the rules and teachings of Islam. Like I said, tons of things their doing is haram. And do some research if you'd like to know as to why ISIL is a thing. ISIL was founded by a salafist in 1999, I'm pretty sure it had no actual significance or relevance at this point, but what put them in power was the fall of Saddam Hussein which basically collapsed the entire government making it easy for them to come to power. Like the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, they want to get rid of foreigners like the west but they are also trying to conquer as much as they can and impose their strict salafist beliefs.

Even Arabs were changed by Islam, yes, their vocabulary may have some Arabic words or they may use the Arabic alphabet, but the English, Spanish, Dutch, French and Portuguese have forced many people to follow their religions, speak their languages and follow their traditions. Many natives were assimilated into the language of the Spaniards, and many Africans, American Natives and even some places in Asia were forced to convert to Christianity! French and English are highly spoken in Africa, much more then Arabic! Same thing with the Americas, but with Spanish instead of French. Vietnamese uses Latin alphabet, not Arabic, not their own, same thing with many \textbf{African} languages, and other East Asian countries. Lots of Central Asia was highly influenced by the Secularist \textbf{Communist} Rooskies, its not a surprise that the government in Tajikistan is how it is right now. Even today, they are heavily influenced by Rooskies. They use the Cyrillic alphabet, not Arabic. It's not Islam that plays fear, it's the Muslims. You are mistaking Salafist terriosts for Islam. So what if it's in Arabic? Most of our prophets are not Arabic, in fact, only two of our prophets were even Arab. Majority of them are Jews. It's in Arabic for fear of lost of meaning through translation or mistranslation, why are some Christian studies in Hebrew or Latin? Why are some Jewish studies in Hebrew? Arabic norms? I already said, it has \textbf{nothing} to do with Arabs, you think it does because Arabs instead follow these norms, and you mistaken that for Arabs following their own norms instead.

Or that someone would pay a women for her to show herself at all disgusting? Yes, to a degree it is disgusting. Were not afraid of it, you just shouldn't do it before your married, that's all. If you want to view it as a disease go ahead. But to add a few things:1. If your going to speak of the actions of the Muslims themselves or even "Muslims" blaming their doings on Islam, refer to the Ummah, not the Deen. 2. ISIL does not fulfil anything to do with Islam, they instead are attempting to grew an empire with themselves at its head. They are using Islam as a cover, and they are also trying to us force people into it, using it. It's not Islam, it's just hooligan terriosts. How can these people be considered Muslims if they don't even truly follow Islam? Think about it.3. Salafism or Wahabism is a extreme interpretation of Islam. Not Islam itself.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Totally subscribed, love the video, You are absolutely right and very wise! I'm American but my ex husband is Saudi, And my children are half Saudi. Not all saudis are bad or horrible but from my personal experience I've had more of the bad hand. At first things were lovely and picture perfect, and I've had a lot of Saudi friends and no offense but I've noticed the ones from the eastern providence such as Safwa and especially Al qatif come off as if they are better, richer, and more important, arrogant. They flash their expensive items and belongings, money, designer wear, and act as if you are beneath them. It's disgusting and wrong! And the way men treat \textbf{woman} is as if they are meat. A lot of saudis I've witnessed have wives back home or fianc√©s and they come here have \textbf{sex} with multiple girls and have babies leaving them behind after promising their mothers the world, false hope, and partying, drinking, drugs, and it goes on and on. It breaks my heart that the mothers and women wives back in Saudi have no clue. Again I'm not \textbf{racist}, I mean come on my children are Saudi, and I love the Arab  Saudi culture and everything about it, but I can't stand others who are arrogant, liars, and come off as if you are \textbf{nothing} but trash beneath them. There is good and bad people all over. Just be wise and take care of yourself, And of course trust your instincts. I love arabs and the cultures. And I will always defend arabs and Muslims.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Thank you! I am half Jordanian half Danish and I grew up in a Somali  Arabic community. I remember that there was this huge Eid party and me and my siblings were playing on the bouncy castles when other children (Much older than us, they were like 14) would threaten us. They'd say things like ''You're not real Muslims, you're Danes! You can't be here! I bet you brought your pig meat as well!'' (This was in the Arabic Eid party, our mosques were based on \textbf{ethnicity} which is just horrible) This made me very sad, and soon enough i began throwing away aspects of my Danish culture. I didn't grow up with Arabic as my second language like all of the other kids, so i started to say things wrong, Grammarly incorrect, just so they'd see me as one of their own.

They were literally talking to us in such a mean way until they asked me if I were Arab and when I told them where I'm from, their tone with me changed COMPLETELY, but they were still treating my friend like shit.

There is a reason why Allah sent the Qu'ran to the Arabs, at that time they were the worst of people and amongst other things like the beauty in the Arabic language. Now to correct your arrogance, brother. Arabs are not the teachers of Islam. Every Muslim is a teacher of Islam. We teach others literally or by our actions. What you're saying as is against the teachings of Muhammad (SAW). You are propagating superiority, do not do that brother. Arabs, Indians, Somalis, Europeans, and what have you are all equal except in good deeds. I repeat Arabs are not the teachers of Islam as Islam belongs to Allah only. Don't forget that Islam existed before Muhammad (SAW). It existed through Abraham, Musa (who was \textbf{black}), and Isa ibn Maryam. Islam was perfected in Arabia, but it started with Abraham. Don't forget your place brother, we are all on equal footing in learning the deen. If you were born Arab say Alhamdullilah that Allah has given you an easier time in learning his words. But do not think you are superior to those who weren't born Arab as they will earn rewards when reading the Qu'ran.

But I was once told that since I didn't know how to speak "real" Arabic, I wasn't Arab. According to the person who told me that, being Arab is defined by your ability to speak Arabic and I was excluded from being one because Algerian Arabic is far from its classical roots.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The notion of Arab superiority predates oil and is deeply rooted in ancient history. Surprisingly, color was not the main driver as Arabs came in different shades. It was the fact that they followed a strict code of "ethics" that valued genealogy and the ability to trace ancestors back to hundreds of years which they believed reflected back on one's personal conduct. It didn't only target non-Arabs as this superiority complex manifested itself in inner-Arab tribal rivalries. Islam came and introduced laws that improved \textbf{race} relations, especially among the first generation of Muslims in Arabia .. it strongly encouraged the freeing of slaves generally and as an atonement for certain crimes. Sadly, it didn't ban it altogether. Muslim Arabs went from having the first \textbf{black} secretary of treasury (Bilal bin Rabah) in Medina in the early days of the Muslim state to enslaving people of all colors in later generations, including white Europeans (Saqalibah). That is not to say it was only practiced by Arabs .. most cultures did it. The only difference is that as Muslims, Arabs struggled to reconcile their pre-Islamic traditions with a new religion that emphasized the equality of all races. This feeling of superiority is a remanent of days past and is mainly discussed behind closed doors since it is frowned upon religiously and morally.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Race & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/220 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.909 \\  \hline

It's not our fault that just because we have similar heritage as of Hindus,  that we have to adopt evrything of theirs.

It's sad and even till now Arabs say that the movement was wrong when it wasn't. Also a lot of the non Arab Muslim scientists and authors in abbasi times were arabnised and even shamed and discriminated and called infidels for having different knowledge or religion (that is not told to anyone who doesn't dig in the history those people we know now as big were people who were wanted for their heads) and for having a mixed blood or for being completely from another \textbf{race} or writing about things that is not \textbf{common} to Arabs knowledge which Persians and Turks mastered.

I'm a person who is really proud to not have even 1 Arab origins and if you consider us Arabs this doesn't flatter us because you're putting a 7 thousand + culture under the Arabian category. We surely all know that the pyramids were built by Egyptians not Arabs. This Arab superiority thing doesn't work on us we're the ones who don't want to be called Arabs not you who don't want us to be one of you. Oh and btw one of the reasons why "you" put us under this category is because of our military forces and we all know that if Egypt becomes independent again your countries will be \textbf{nothing} without us and our protection. The world knows Egypt for its culture not for being Arab.

Yes, Egypt has an ancient non Arab cultural heritage, no-one denied that. However, Arab culture has been a huge influence on Egypt for well over a thousand years, in addition to the many people that migrated to Egypt from the Levant and the Arab peninsula. In the modern political sense most Egyptians consider themselves Arab and are considered Arab in a broad sense on the world stage due to their close linguistic, geographical and cultural ties with the rest of the Arab world. This in no way means that Egyptians have given up, or were asked to give up their unique cultural identity as Egyptians.

To be fair though, I've hardly acquainted myself with European Canadians in my time here since I live in Toronto, but on the off-chance that I have it's almost always a negative experience because I'm outwardly Muslim. Despite all this, I do miss life in Jeddah, the friends I made, the vibrant masjids, the overall friendly people, and the feeling of truly living under Islam. I cannot stress the final point enough, since living in the west inevitably corrupts your imaan. As evidence for this, the general Muslim population where I live are deep into riba and their brains have been hardwired to accept secular liberalism. If it were up to me, I would have never left KSA, even if it meant working a menial job.

He said he never experienced that in any of travels to the US because no matter what they treat you politely. My sister lived in Saudi Arabia and she narrated the arrogance with which Saudis treat South Asian workers and it's beyond anything you can imagine. Pakistanis don't have a superiority complex that does not mean that every Pakistani will be inclusive of everyone but they don't treat you like shit the way some Arabs do. Your own comment proves that you lack basic manners on how to deal with criticism. There is colorism prevalent in most societies including Pakistan but people don't treat foreigners living in their communities as lesser humans as a norm. It actually was an \textbf{Indian} incident in which \textbf{black} Nigerians were attacked and beaten horribly in a mall this year not in Pakistan.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Actually, Arabs prefer skin tones that are within a certain range. Too dark or too pale indicates that the person is not actually pure Arab. Not sure where this idea that we prefer pale skin and blue eyes is coming from. It is often questionable and referred to as mixed blood. The root of it comes from the fact that during the glory days of Arabs, slaves and concubines were brought in from Africa, Eastern Europe and Caucasian mountains. It is associated with most Arab's minds that way. That's why very dark and very light complexions are not favoured. Some Arab tribes are known to have gingers and in the greater Syria region ( Syria, Lebanon, Palestinian, Jordan and north western Iraq) we know what towns and villages have \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} hair and pale skin gene mutations. The obsession with pale skin and blue eyes comes from the same mentality of idolizing your colonizer. For Arabs that refers toThe ottomans. True Arabs genuinely dislike very pale skin and blue eyes because it is either associated with slavery and concubines or colonization. Dark skin is just like the rest of the world association with slavery. Avoiding the sun is mainly because when an Arab tans, most often it gets blotchy and uneven after few weeks. I personally grew up hearing ' too pale .. has no colour.. looks skinned.. has Asian features.. kinky haired.. big lips' as characters to dislike. All back to the same point, just like everyone, Arabs prefer what resembles them. Supreme? Not really.. it is simply not same values or look of who we are. Arabs are the kindest and most genuinely accepting of others. Just because we appreciate who and what we are does not mean we have supremacy complex. I believe that as Arabs we have always been defending who we are because other Muslims and neighboring nations resent us for a few hundred glory years that are long gone now.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Red & \cellcolor{green!5} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Ethnicity - Native-American & \cellcolor{green!5}2/326 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.613 \\  \hline

It's really sad to see this happening in the land where once our Prophet (saws) spoke of equality among all races. But nevertheless, there are Arabs who are generous and kind. May Allah swt bless us all with hidayah and hikmah.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Indian & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Native-American & \cellcolor{green!27}1/85 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.176 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Majeedah KhanI have seen the Prophet PBH 17 times in my life ,most Arabs I have seen do not look like the Prophet PBH. Yes I know that there are many Arabs who have  this type of behavior but I have also seen this with some of the Pakistanis so \textbf{racism} and arrogance exists in all races .  Can you imagine the Prophet PBH he was majestic and people would tremble in front him yet there was 100  no  pride and arrogance in him so people should feel ashamed of themselves if they say "I am"I have seen Prophet Abraham ,Isa,Musa,and Nabi Khidr PBT one time  how I saw Nabi Ibrahim PBH was the following: I saw Sayyidina Ibrahim PBH with a face that was not completely round but slightly oval, upside v eye brows, v hairline and hair was a raven \textbf{black} and wavy and he had a aquiline nose bridge which was one flowing curve not a bump then a curve and not hooked neither jagged neither too big or too small . The curve started at root of nose  and was straight across at the nasal base  and he was  fair in color  and i saw him without a mustache just like how you see some muslim grow their beard everything about him was not too much and not too little.   The Prophet PBH said he resembled his forefather the most and he is truthful in his speech\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Racism & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/244 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.82 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Subhi! Thank you for this video! I've been always trying to fix or fight this mentality but I'm usually told that I'm just too sensitive or it's not that big of a deal or I should just shut up about it. The superiority thing has always made me very angry and I was never afraid or shy to tell the people or my family and relatives that what they're saying is indeed very \textbf{racist} and is very wrong. We are equal to other races and cultures as humans but Arabs are very arrogant, it's just \textbf{dumb} and annoying. I hope it changes one day.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Dumb, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}2/104 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.923 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small As an Asian at \textbf{age} 11 that hadn't been exposed to Arabs before umrah, I was to say the least shocked how they treated us. \textbf{Nobody} really looked at us like equals and i wasn't sure why. I heard my parents discussing how they judged us through our colour and inability to speak Arabic. The way even shopkeepers treated us was appalling. I've never understood it since we have been taught that we are all equal but coming from a part Arab I'm glad to know that I wasn't just hallucinating about the discrimination we faced.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Nobody & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!27}2/96 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.083 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small It's probably your features not your colour because some arabs are quiet dark and that's a shame. Especially in saudi when it's supposed to be the holiest and one of the most religious lands. I suppose \textbf{racism} exists in every culture though south-east asians are usually very \textbf{racist} towards \textbf{black} people but they look up to arabs a lot. I just think \textbf{racism} is a display of ignorance and miseducation or no education. I can definitely tell this is how the muslim community feels as a whole though\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}4/88 & \cellcolor{green!5}4.545 \\  \hline
