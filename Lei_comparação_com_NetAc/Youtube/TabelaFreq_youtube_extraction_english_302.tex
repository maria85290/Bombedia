  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Its all divide and conquer. It is an \textbf{age} \textbf{old} phenomenon. Creating chaos through division by way of staged violence and anarchy all designed using paid activists. These activists are political extremists and are deemed by the state  to be useful idiots. They are promoted to bring about friction and bring about violence. Then another element is put into play namely 'The war on terror'  This will bring more confusion. The state will use its media conglomerate to agitate the public into fear and anger by promoting all types of hatred and division. The state will agitate both sides to create more anger and envy. The state will trample on constitutional law. The state will do all it can to disarm the public of its means to protect itself. Into this the promotion of degeneracy and odd practices become the order of the day. The rational become the new heretics. The public growing ever tired of this maelstrom will beg the state to provide them with order and security. The state will then ensue marshal law to give them the false perception that they are being protected from chaos which has been strategically managed through stage craft. The state will use this as a pretext to rule over them with an iron fist. Any type of freedoms and liberty will be outlawed. The state will become tyrannical. The guns will be confiscated. The state is a servant to the oligarchy. The enemy of the oligarchy are the people who want to be left in peace. The oligarchy will consolidate into global governance.

Germany has had Turkish Muslim guest workers for decades, who are now citizens, and their children are now German citizens. For these anti-immigration parties, ANY non-white German is a foreigner. One could oppose new immigration by calling for limited quotas, or by making an argument that the German state does not have the resources to accept so many people so quickly (which is true). Instead, they resorted to arguments about the incompatibility of non-white and non-Christian people with German society.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Ugh as a leftist, it's frustrating for me to see The NY Times reporting on this now. For years, the liberal media has been helping to normalize the far-right. They have run so many light, coddling pieces about how surprised they are that some people in the alt-right dress nicely, or that there are hipsters who are fascists, as if this is some quirky trend to cover with no consideration of how the tone and content of your reporting can literally affect the course of political history. By giving them the visibility of massive mainstream platforms, they exposed lots of people to the fact that there is a growing, ostensibly anti-establishment movement of these people and let them throw a few talking points out on the air, but they never really confronted the content of their platform in a meaningful way or really got confrontational with them when given the chance, to force them to show their true colors. Ironically, by shirking this journalistic responsibility in favor of the liberal ethic of "I have to seem nonpartisan and balanced, I can't take a side" they have helped mainstream the very people people who may end up literally undoing of the liberal culture and pluralistic liberal democracies that they claim to value. These monsters are cropping up in one country after another as people get fed up with the status quo of neoliberal capitalism (and in many places like the US, being excluded by two-party political systems that claim to be democratic), and liberals have no response. Historically it was the left that provided a productive alternative for people to go to, to organize and press their demands for a civilized, just society, but the establishment (liberal and conservative alike) in many of the Western countries (especially the US) have virtually wiped the left off the political spectrum-- in America virtually all left-wing parties and labor unions are gone, and those that claim to represent labor are led by class collaborationists who are happy to sell the workers out to the owning class (so they might as well not exist). In places like France, Germany, and Britain, the socialist and labor parties ended up bought and accepted neoliberal "reforms" instead of pushing back, and that caused many workers to give up on the left altogether, moving to reactionary far-right movements (to the point where the French Socialist Party and the Greek Socialist Party were pretty much wiped out and replaced altogether). Liberals may not understand all of the ways that their politicians, journalist, and theorists/intellectuals have effectively aided these horrific movements, but there is a very real share of responsibility on them. I don't blame every liberal-- most individuals haven't done anything active, because most of them don't have giant platforms to give them visibility on, or political power to either use to help average workers and the poor (thereby legitimizing the system of liberalism) or to use to benefit the few richest capitalists (what they actually did). Having political power or a major mainstream media outlet is a level of power and influence that really does come with a certain social responsibility, and the way they have used that power since WWII (and especially since the 70s, when neoliberalism replaced New Deal values in most "center-left"/social-democratic/liberal parties) has led us directly to this crisis, where democracy itself has become delegitimized in many people's eyes because of the failings of so-called democracies (really quite plutocratic republics) and the quite right-wing liberals who were so happy to "reach across the aisle" and to work "bipartisanly" to help pass right-wing legislation that deregulated finance (eventually leading to the economic crash of 2008 that we're still recovering from), imposed austerity (which really has meant cutting social spending and public works while spending hundreds of billions on military and corporate welfare) and trade liberalization (which has often meant jobs pouring out of the developed world into poorer countries with lower wages with less developed labor movements)... The legislation that has made people so incredibly desperate and unhappy with the status quo that they're turning to literal Nazism and fascism. And liberalism has no answer to this trend-- it has two choices. Just say to these people (in the words of Felix Beiderman) about the world they've created, "No, actually you love it--" because they ARE the status quo. We are living liberalism, by and large, in the West. Or, their other choice. They can move to the left in a meaningful way and actually offer the programs THAT HAVE WORKED BEFORE in the New Deal, in Scandinavia, and so on. If the Democrats just embraced universal healthcare and higher education, they would win by a landslide and the alt-right would be marginalized. If the Syriza had been able to stick to their anti-austerity campaign promises without the aggressive economic threats levied by the troika of lenders and had had a real chance to implement their agenda, they would have had seriously good odds of winning over many of the poor, starving people who turned to the Golden Dawn \textbf{Nazi} Party out of desperation. And on down the line-- social democracy and democratic socialism are the only policies which can consistently make life livable for working people (at least until capitalists inevitably try to undermine them and roll back their programs, which is one of the big reasons why I think we need a system change to socialism rather than capitalism with some government program palliatives, but that's another topic). The problem is that the political elites who run the dominant political parties are reliant on the campaign finance from the biggest donors (who are the ultra-rich and corporations), and their donors don't want those policies, so they can't. And besides, if they moved to the left, it wouldn't really be liberalism anymore. It would just be social democracy. So I don't think there's really any saving liberalism, technically, and I do think they've inadvertently helped caused the proliferation of these ultranationalist movements and have a horrible track record-- but the good news is that if we just move to the left adequately and organize around actually productive goals and values, then we can win back quite a bit of the support that these parties only have because of economic circumstances. There is a growing part of the population who supports them for other reasons-- namely, because of a massive campaign of propaganda that wealthy, powerful people have been spreading including these insane conspiracy theories about "cultural Marxism" that helped elect Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil, among other undesirable monsters... But those \textbf{loony} right-wing ideologies are mostly too far gone anyway. It's the young people who lack perspective, but then are exposed to this propaganda and go "I am discontent with the status quo and this gives me an explanation of why, and an enemy to fear and hate," so they buy into it and assume anything contradicting that information is just cultural Marxist lies... It would be funny if this wasn't becoming a normal thing to encounter. The mainstream media hasn't done much to counter that narrative either. I rarely see it even afinowledged, probably because they are so disconnected from people outside their well-to-do circles and don't see how prominent these trends are among the hoi polloi.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Loony, Nazi & \cellcolor{green!27} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}2/1212 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.165 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@asborhen I live in a metropolitan area in the USA that has been about 50 "taken over" by immigrants since the 70's.  While it is not ALL bad, the areas in which they have "taken over" have been clearly blighted and are high with crimes of all kinds... the areas look like the places from which they "fled" for a better life, yet the areas they proliferate not only "look" like the places they came from, but are areas in which the opportunity they came to this country for have diminished greatly as well.  I believe there will be another 5 decades or so before homeostasis is re-established OR another 5 decades or so before virtually the entire area is turned into something completely different AND something that changes the trajectory of increasing opportunities if they keep pouring in as they have AND if they continue to reproduce as rapidly as they do and at the young ages at which they begin to reproduce... it is likely that this kind of degradation will continue... of course there are a lot of dynamics going on and it does not necessarily mean the future is totally bleak, but I see the opportunities for EVERYONE diminishing as the true concern, whether that is how the trajectory will continue or not, it is difficult to say... I am mostly optimistic ... but, this idea about how a previously thriving and safe area can quickly become blighted and unrecognizable, rapidly, IS very real.  It would not be impossible for the majority of a country to eventually become unrecognizable and the mindsets that supported the problems that lead the immigrants to leave their original homelands in the first place could easily serve to recreate the same atmosphere and problems in the new area if they dominate an area eventually.  Frankly, I think that is what happened in the USA... the Europeans moved in... the natives were taken out... things developed, a lot of crappy crap happened (and still is happening) and while there was some good out of the whole deal... the same problems, due to the general European mindsets, exist here. The concern is not false fear... it is unfortunate that these real aspects cannot be discussed without it turning into some kind of \textbf{race} hatred thing.  Although, when you are allowing millions of immigrants within a short span of time to move into a Western multi-cultural and tolerant society,  from cultures that are chiefly intolerant and who are taught to hate the Western Civilization...  it should NOT be ignored.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small ​\@ben dover  Oh, I will happily give you some basic history classes, the type of classes that kids have at 11 or 12 in some countries where ppl are actually educated.1.  the Franco-Prussian war ( July 1870 - January 1871): The conflict oppose the French Empire and Republic and Italy to a large coalition of German states led by the Kingdom of Prussia. More than 1M of dead and wounded. This world war (sorry but USA wasn't there, and this war is still considered as a world war between 2 majors powers at that time), was lost by the French and led to some majors territorial losses such as the 2 French states known as Alsace and Lorraine. Those losses lead to what is known as the "Great War".2. the "Great War" (July 1914 - November 1918). This war was initiated by the assassination of archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo by some yougoslavists affiliated to the anarchists AND the German invasions of Belgium and France. This period represent the end of the European Empires in the XXth century and a need for revenge for a lot of europeans,  who where fed up with the "German authority", France wanted back the Alsace and Lorraine considered as occupied by germans, which was the case considering the fact that the people living there where always loyals to France. This war represent also the first time when the term of "Allied" was use as a result of the "Triple Entente" between Russia, France and UK opposed to the "Triple Alliance" between Italy, Germany and Austria (Bulgaria too, who was under German authority and the Ottoman Empire who plead allegiance to Germany and then became somehow the "Quadruple Alliance"). The "Great War" is the deadliest conflict in modern history (almost 100 M deaths world wide), the conflict spread because of the fact that germans never wanted to respect the territorial integrity of others European nations.3. WWII as the Americans called it first and the became an usual/easy term, (September 1939 - September 1945). This war was fulled by the deep German humiliation in the "Great War", the poverty that been caused for the Germans, a need for revenge, a \textbf{racist} ideology and the European cowardice, France collaborate with the \textbf{nazi} Germany, mixed with some Italian fascism (Mussolini) and a Spanish civil war between republicans and the General Franco, also a fascist and a great friend of Hitler, USSR with Stalin who was a German allied until 1941, Japan at war with China since the 1920's and allied to Germany and USA who, after Pearl Harbor, in December 1941, join the "Allies" a.k.a. UK and USSR. So yes, there are 3 world wars in the modern History, all caused by Germany at some levels.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small This would not have happened if Liberal EU politicians had not opened the door to mass migrations of people who 1: Do not speak the language and therefore can't get accustomed to the local culture and customs. 2. Cant get jobs due to language and skill differences. 3. don't have adequate resources to house and educate at these numbers. 4:  drain the welfare system that is there for tax paying citizens. 5. need to create ghettos to house these migrants which leads to balkanization of the region they live in causing them to resist integrating into German culture because they are only surrounded by those of their own culture  . 6 the native German citizens should not be forced to change their Culture in order to accommodate nearly a million people in a short period of time. 7. those migrants are not the best of the best of immigrants and thus the actions of a few will stain the majority which in this political climate is enough to cause regular citizens to fear.  Legal immigration works because the people applying want to be in the country they are immigrating to and are aware of the culture and have the requite skills to integrate and be a productive part of a strong society. i.e Canada and the US. There will always be racists no matter what, but the majority of the Germans would turn to these political extremes if they felt that their way of life was under attack.

Polish people and Syrians are intergrating fine even without speaking the langauge and their are plenty of ways to learn or get help with thelangauge barrier.3. While the numbers are vast, education is simple, and immigrants are famous for intagrating to cultural norms (even if that means essentually killing their \textbf{old} culture to get there...)4.Welfare is made to help people, why does it matter to whom it goes to? If it goes to someone who will be a doctor in five-or-so years or a farmer, what is the problem then? If you are against it going to a one person, who validates who we should give it to then?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Joan of Arc Alter I appreciate your optimism about the situation. And yes there are many great immigrants who come with very little, and succeed through hard work. But this situation is very different than the one you have in mind, one being legal immigration and two in controlled costed numbers. 1. That gentleman who was assaulted by those Nazi's deserves justice. Those people that committed that crime should be prosecuted to the fullest extent. There is no place for violence and \textbf{racism}.  Unfortunately, in any population you will have people on either side of the political spectrum from Nazi's to anarchists. But the majority of people will be in the center of the distribution.2)Yes i agree. I personally know of people that have done so. I have no doubt some will. But the issue isn't that they can. The issue in the huge number in a short period of time. The resources required to coordinate, set up and teach German to thousands of people, while providing them food, shelter and living allowances isn't realistic. Government programs can only do so much. And the cost to provide all these things are on the backs of the taxpayer.3)Immigrants are famous for integrating ? Yes some are and others are not. In this case these people are literally coming with \textbf{nothing} and with little to no family support. They are essentially a ward of the government ( tax payer funded). The infrastructure has to be in place to be able to provide and accommodate for these people. It really is not that simple. And the longer it takes to do so the harder it is to integrate and educate them. Some of them may need to go to college. You think all universities can admit that number over night? Do german citizens get disadvantaged because there would be a quota to educate thousands of new people, and thus less resources for german citizens? 4.yes welfare is a safety net for those that really need it. What it is not is money for foreign aid. Which governments are  essentially having to do to pay for thousands of migrants until they are stable enough to take care of themselves. You are also hoping that these people want to succeed. Not all of them are going to be \textbf{doctors}. Does anyone know what kind of skills these people have? 5. Ghetto, may have been a strong word. What i meant to say are areas where u have one culture completely dominate the native one to a point where it does not resemble the surrounding areas. You will see areas that have large numbers of migrants that are idle, such as coffee shops, malls etc where they associate only within their own groups. This drastically changes the demographics of the area. This does happen, check out Malmo, Sweden if you need a reference. 6. It is very difficult for one to change cultural norms unless they are a child. Have u read about reports in Germany about safety officials telling women to cover up because they can't protect women from being sexually assaulted by migrants? In your own country officials are willing to have double standards? What happened to the feminists?  What kinds of people have they brought in? I have never heard of such things with legal immigrants before.    7.There is a huge difference between a person from Ireland and a person from the middle east. They have a completely different value system. This isn't to say all europeans are great either, you have good apples with bad ones. If u transplant 1 million germans and put them in the middle of china do u think they will be able to "integrate" the way you describe as easy?\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nothing, Racism, doctors & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/625 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.48 \\  \hline

From other countrys (sweden) we know, that only a third of them has a job after 10 years. Its a huge strain on our econemy and gevourment budget.2. We already got a demographic problem in germany. But only in the german population. In the \textbf{immigrant} population (defined as first and second generation immigrants) there is no such problem. So even without immigration german population which ancestors lived here for hundreds and thousand of years will get a minority. Just trough having less babys than immigrants. It gets faster through immigration which is as last year about +400000 (came intro country minus went out of the country). Germany is changing and its not a small change. The population is changing and the culture is changing with it. If the trend countinues islam will get the predominant religion.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Gouverneur-Generaal van Heutsz Funny how I lived in Germany as a 'foreigner' (From Finland) for over a year, and every right-winger i came across was okay with me because "you seem German enough, you fit in". It seems the foreigner issue only becomes a real problem worth of protest when you have the wrong skin-tone and don't have the right "look" to be German. Another thing I noticed, during my stay as I lived in an \textbf{immigrant} heavy neighborhood in Berlin, because cheaper rents - I had a roommate that was a Syrian \textbf{refugee} and another roommate that was from Iran. Never felt unsafe in my home, on the streets, and was treated with hospitality by everyone, Germans and immigrants. The vast majority of the immigrants I met (including my two roommates) spoke nearly fluent German too. In fact, I found pretty quickly that many foreigners from places like Australia, Uk etc. that had moved there didn't seem to have any intention of learning German (even though some had stayed for years), but everyone I met from a middle-eastern background was enrolled in German courses and studying it rigorously. I can't help but think this \textbf{immigrant}-hate comes with a heavy schema of what kind of people others imagine immigrants from the middle-east/north-africa as, and there's plenty of propaganda out there to make it all seem like they are all unethical criminals. It's important to remember in all of this the most people are just normal people, no matter what background. That all said, I don't believe in open-door policies forever or do understand there is a limit to the capacity of migrants at a time that a \textbf{nation} can handle. But the Syria crisis was in fact an extreme situation, which lead to this influx in the first place. I don't agree that it makes any sense to create a threatening environment for other law-abiding people because you feel like they resemble other people who commit crimes.

Your sentence is absolutely naive and stupid to say the least. Just read some basic books like Gustave LeBons "Psychology of the masses" or read some Nietzsche.

I agree that generally speaking we should have some kind of human-patriotism that binds us, but we need \textbf{nationalism} and the acceptance of national identity and racial and cultural differences first because we can establish a meaningful and harmonic relationships between all humans worldwide, just compare the USA with countries like Japan or Switzerland and Iceland, homogenous countries are always more peacefull und unviolent then multicultural ones.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nationalism & \cellcolor{green!5}Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/200 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.5 \\  \hline

Rings are no longer for luck, because you have another choice. Not revenge, not institutions, not power and not prosperity buy you. Be what you were, what you should be, what you should never forget. Be hate and do not hate, be ridiculed and do not defend yourself."Simson Germany! Your eye is \textbf{blind}, your forehead is \textbf{bald}. Turn your gaze into yourself, turn your titanic power against yourself. You will not break the pillars of the earth. The court is not yours. Turn the mill of the Philistines and sing the song of God.Ahasver Germany! You do not have power to die. German feet will move across the earth and seek home. You will eat a bitter bread and your home will not be your home. From strange doors they will hunt you for the reflection in your tired eyes.O you Germany! Loved in your foolish delusion, tenfold loved in your godforsaken madman and vice, ten thousand times loved in your humiliating suffering, what do you know of your fate? ...You are arrested and lapsed, and when the hands of men let go of you, you fall into the hands of God." Source: Walther Rathenau in "Critique of the Triple Revolution", p. 67/77Ive asked myself why the elite is targeting germany/germans the most and ve found out really corious stuff.The Germans were the Assyrians.Before emigrating to Europe, they lived in the near of the Caspian  \textbf{Black} Sea. After the Assyrian kingdom fell, they migrated along the \textbf{Black} Sea to the river Moselle in Germany. There they also built the first European city called Trier. Trier is 1300 years older than Rome. This is how it stands in Latin on the \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} house in Trier.In the past they invented the wheel and in the modern day the car.The Germans/Assyrians are called in the bible as "gods hands and the root of his anger. They are the sword of god. Jahwe said that the assyrian king (the next chancellor maybe) will be the one who leads the beast (political system/EU), will fight against Jahwe. Short Version: Who is Jahwe? The creator god of the egyptian believe was named "El Schaddai" and not jahwe. Moses was maybe a egyptian pharao (Tutmoses III) who connected to a creature which is described on the Kabbalah as a desert demon with the name jahwe.
