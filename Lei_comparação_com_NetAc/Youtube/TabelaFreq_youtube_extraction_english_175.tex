  \cellcolor{green!5}\small As a gen X'er,  I feel for the gen z's. My niece and nephew (my sister's kids) and my daughter are gen z. My son is born after them in 2008 so I don't know what he'd be. I'm reading some comments on how social media may not be causing anxiety or depression, but rather it's the state of the world that is, and I totally agree. The kids are REALLY scared for the future but feel powerless so they escape thru electronics, they feel super timid about social rules being and not being offensive and are insecure and super sensitive in a crippling way. It makes me shake my head that people want to blame something else rather than look at the world they're leaving to them as a major cause. Especially the boomers. My mom is a boomer. She divorced three times. My brothers are millennials and never married and one still lives in my moms basement. They're scared of relationships. They're screwed up. She does not fully understand how hard it is for the other generations. My daughter just started high school and last year she had to pick her courses. What do you tell a kid who may not even see half the jobs existing by the time she graduates? When my son graduates, will university even exist? Already it's becoming obsolete and too expensive. It's a dinosaur and behind the times. Many companies will train directly because many degrees will mean \textbf{nothing}. Education is still stuck in rural farming culture. The biggest fears are the economy, and climate change. It's not encouraging to see boomers so selfish and critical of younger generations even denying  climate change altogether because they don't want to change their lifestyle or give up comfort.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}1/294 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.34 \\  \hline

I'm also 13 but I have never felt depressed or felt anxiety from what iv'e seen is that we are actually pretty optimistic but somehow we have a STRANGE obsession with sexuality? TBH from what I heard before the 90s like I guess kids had more freedom like they could literally stay outside until the light flickers or go to the movies by themselves.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I have Replied on this Post for a while now, But this is my final one. Generation Z is a Young but not the Youngest generation out there. There is Gen Alpha, Whom literally always finds ways to Play with the Tech available to them. Gen Z is a Multi-Personality Generation, So you obviously can't speak for all of us. I'm currently in 7th Grade, but tbh, Me and MILLIONS of Gen Z feel as though they are Cheated or Ignored by the School System, and put as a Puppet. When most of us go to explain it to our Parents or Family, Many of them above the \textbf{Age} of 20 say "your generation is just lazy" or "we did much more work than you ever did". In a way, They are right, But mostly no. Millennials are the Generation just above us, and who still believe we are apart of them or a Puppet. Back in 2009, I used to see that the Millennials in my Family treated me and my Fellow Gen Z Family members like utter Dirt, While the Millennials were treated (not like angels but similar). 10 years later, In 2019, Me and my Gen Z family members are Grown as they were 10 years Earlier, But we are treated like Children, Even though we qualify as Teenagers. Moving on, Gen Y is VERY Similar to Millennials, So similar in fact, They are often being Joined into the Generation. Gen X, The Generation above Gen Y/Millennials is a very different Generation. They are very Organic and Nature going and often believe the 1950's/1940's are some of the Best decades in American History. Like almost all Generations before and after, You cannot Speak for all. Most of Gen X is the way the Stereotype is, The Nature going/Natural Organic/Angered at literally Everything wrong kind. Baby Boomers, Baby Boomers are one of the most "different" Generations out there, Simply because they were Hippies while most of their Children became Hipsters and their Parents being the Average 1950's Kind. Baby Boomers are the ones who do blame us for being messed up due to "social media" and Iphone use, But in reality, They were the ones who made it after all, \textbf{Apple}, Microsoft.. Etc.. Going deeper, The Silent Generation is one of the few, Very "antique" Generations. They are in fact (Different but not Different). They are the Reason Factories were able to bring up Economic Growth for Gen X, But ultimately failing to Help other Generations due to their motto for Kids/Teens: "To be Seen, But not to Speak" Or something like that. I would continue this, But time matters, so I will end this with one, Very simple Signing to my Fellow Gen Z, and also Gen Alpha: Pls fricken make this world greater and end the corrupt school system pls ;-;, the school system is a failure, and we should all learn via online (from tuesday to thursday), if this happens for workplaces as well, depression and stress make go down a bit, so pls do it :)\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Apple & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Ethnicity - Native-American & \cellcolor{green!27}2/512 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.391 \\  \hline

I'm going in to biology, and going on to a good graduate school to get my doctorate in biomedical engineering to design devices that actually make a difference for people who were injured or lost limbs fighting for our country. I plan to double major in art and design so that I can design appealing advertisement by myself, independently. Maybe the I in igen stands for independent, because most of my classmates are also planning to make it on the world on their own. If you want something done you have to do it yourself, but leave room for passion. I'm passionate about art and biology, and I want to help people who serve in the armed forces, to be a support to lean on. GenZ will be successful, using the shortcomings of previous generations to their advantage, helping each other because no one else will, seeking out facts for them selves because every other source has an agenda, this is genZ, and we're here to stay, until we inevitably fail and die.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Gender & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/227 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.881 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small This video is liberal media prapaganda. Gen Z and even more as you get older continuing into what the most accurate polls can predict, the next years of voters will be more and more and more conservative than the last years of voters with exceptions for typical party intervals. They are expected when they are all of voting \textbf{age} to be solidly conservative politically and extremely entreprenerial similar to gen Xer's but the degree to how socially liberal+conservative will be surprising. The ONLY thing confusing those media talking about Gen Z/iGen that aren't making propaganda pieces is that they seem socially "liberal" and conservative on punishment as well as economically conservative/liberal, except liberal in this sense refers to the laws while conservative refers to society's responsibility to people while liberal also refers to it's traditional political meaning and not it's reversed leftist meaning of "authoritarian progressive social laws that criminalizes all traditions and things older generations value," into meaning they are very liberal with the law with regards to social issues but very traditional with regards to expectations and the expression of those expectations (that fall under liberal social laws that allow expression for and against mainstream), economically traditionally american and conservative, both in their spending and the government's.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/209 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.478 \\  \hline

Every generation has had serious issues, whether you like to address it or not, for example, ( \textbf{racism}, slavery, \textbf{sexism}, normalised abuse, \textbf{homophobia}, freaking WW1 and 2..)And yet, with all the other far more major problems that have occured, what will be the most tolerant and advanced people that will likely accomplish so many wonderous things, are being criticized for spending too much time on their phones.. A very minor issue compared to the rest of human history if you ask me..May I add that criticising children and calling them stupid for technology overuse has a sort of sick and twisted feeling to it? It's almost as if saying that they're already predestined to be moronic druggies that can't do anything useful for anyone.Mocking the younger generations has always existed and different generations just have different cultures than you do,criticising it doesn't make you better than anyone.Anyway, those are just my views, have a nice day to whoever is reading.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Homophobia, Racism, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General, Gender - General, Sexual Identity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/176 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.705 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Millennialist: 80s-90s Gen Z: late 90s-Late 00sGen Alpha: 2010-2020s The generation being surrounded with technology and phones is gen alpha. My cousin is only 8 and has never been seen without a tablet in her hand. As a gen Z member, I remember how everyone was amazed by the iPhone. It was kind of unfathomable to have a phone like that. Our house had only one computer which everyone in the house used. Eventually everyone got a laptop or desktop but that's because they became easier to purchase. Also, there was an increase for them in childhood education. Sure, I learned how to work a computer at school, and I've learned the proper way you should be surfing the web; it wasn't a big of a thing to use technology until I was in middle school. Advances in phones, tablets, and computers made it easy for anyone to communicate, research, and veg out however they wanted.What I think that is forgotten is that now, the teenagers who are constantly on their phones, are seen more as introverted losers. When in fact, this is the opposite. We go through the same social experiences as the older generations. We aren't unable to relate to others. We go through break ups, fall outs, drama, gain friends, build international relationships, learn about various cultures, keep up with family all using our phones. Sure it's not pen and paper, or face to face, but at it's core it is still considered communicating. It's the same as sending a letter and waiting for a response, but only quicker. Most people have \textbf{mental} disorders because there is no barrier from the real world, the thousands of ads we receive in one hour, and the pressure that we have to be better than our predecessors simply because we can type things fast. We process so much that it's hard to put it down when almost every thing you see is designed to prey on the weakest parts of your mind.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Mental & \cellcolor{green!5}Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}1/334 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.299 \\  \hline

There's alot of shit going on in families that everyone likes to pretend doesn't exist. I have issues that root from a very bad past.

The self-help and body positivity movement is thriving, as is minimalism, zero-waste, and nomadic lifestyles.

When we did actually get the internet we had aol dial up. Smart phones were not a \textbf{common} thing until late into my teen years, and I didn't even actually have one until college.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Honestly, I wouldn't say I'm born in the wrong generation but I feel as if there is a lot of pressure growing up in these times. And as accepting as a lot of us are of things that weren't accepted years ago, if you wanna set your phone down and not text back for awhile, people act like you die or don't care about them at all. Over a simple conversation. It's like everyone feels entitled to attention 24/7 and they blame you in some way of being a problem. Start something out of \textbf{nothing}. Of course someone of this generation can go outside and get away from technology but it gets lonely sometimes. Almost like it's \textbf{weird} behavior for an average kid/teenager. Inviting a friend is a hit or miss. They could either be on the same page as you or most likely, bring their phone to snap a selfie. But at the same time, I understand bringing your phone for safety reasons. That was the intention of phones in the beginning. Contact. Emergency. But I almost feel as if that leads to someone eventually going on their phone out of habit. If you have little self control... of course you'll check every 10 minutes. Now it seems the amount of followers and appreciation you get, determines self worth. Technology is amazing, I just wish that people could embrace both life and technology and important and not. This is just my thoughts on this. I just turned 19 this year and I feel as if it's hard to keep contact with people who have (so far) lived the majority of their lives online. No one can really say how this will turn out as kids will get older but I just hope my kids get a choice or can get balance between the real world and the online world. I just want them to be able to have a choice and be happy.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nothing, Weird & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}2/324 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.617 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I was born in 1996, and I feel like I can relate to both early gen z's and late millennials. Like, my childhood was playing outside with friends and family. I watched cartoons on a box tv with an antenna. I grew up with more VHS than DVD movies, and even when I got DVD's, they were normal ones cause Blu-ray wasn't really a thing yet. I didn't get an actual working phone until 8th grade, and that was only because I had after school clubs. If I wanted to use a real cellphone, I could... but there'd be no battery or no SIM card in it. And I was fine with that. My family didn't alway have cable. For half of my life, we'd have cable for Maybe a couple of years before it got shut off because we couldn't afford to pay it. I remember dial-up somewhat because we had a super \textbf{old} computer, and I clearly remember using a landline until I was about 14 or 15. But, what I don't get is why my parents, the same ones who wouldn't buy me my own phone until I was almost in high school, have gotten my 11 year \textbf{old} sister an iPhone, 2 ipads, and a kindle. She's 11.

I didn't grow up with the internet on tap, and I was in secondary school by the time I actually saw and used an iphone in real life.

And it's for generation z and the next generation's problem to face in the future as well as with global warming and unsustainability with pollution -ehem--plastic pollution.

Some countries went through huge changes while others didn't.The idea of basing a generation on tragic events mainly from the US is ridiculous.If we go by a tragedy that messed up every country all Generations would have to change and some unchanged.You can correct me on this opinion.To those using personal experience, everyone is different with some similarities due to riches (poor, middle class or rich), \textbf{ethnic} background, religious or no beliefs, and how you were brought up.You can be 30, 20 and 8 but be brought up by the same generation with similar things within the household and values but only differ due to changes in neighbourhood and background.Some of the newest gens alpha Z and oldest Gen Y were raised by Gen X, thanks to egg freezing, surrogates and....single mothers doing their thing.If we add changes to education, gaming systems and apps (some are using as change of generation) that would make generations ridiculously small.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small They blame social media and comparing themselves to others for gen z being higher in depression and anxiety rates, it's true but in the way that this generation is wildly more aware of what's going on in the world at a younger \textbf{age}, they don't get the filter of the local news station or paper to see what's going on in the world, they have easy access to every angle of everything going on.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I'm currently in 8th grade, so I would like to inform some adults what goes on in a Gen Z's day to day life. I would like to inform you that we are not what we think. In my school, I can't speak for others, the kids are pessimistic, tired, sad, and opinionated. "See Something, Say Something"(an initiative based on preventing violent acts and improving student \textbf{mental} health through student awareness of problems and learning to see signs of depression in and outside of school, mostly based on social media) is shoved down our throats, teaching us do something most of us refuse to do, not for our sake, but for others. Almost all of us know what it is like to be in a dark place, and we know that adults knowing that you don't want help from does \textbf{nothing} but hurt you. We are too sympathetic to do something before they try to handle it themselves, but no adult understands that, and rather sees \textbf{mental} illness as something that they could prevent by forcing the child to talk. In my school, we talk about what a wreck the school system is. State testing gives us anxiety that we can't afford. We retain very little of what we learn, a result of being taught to learn for a test, and not to learn for ourselves. We find our interests outside of school and have intelligent disscussions about these interests with our friends. We pressure ourselves to succeed in school, even though we find most of it pointless, because if we don't do well our failure will be on the news, mocking us for being the "worst generation yet." In my favorite class, English, we have class political discussions and have Socratic Circles, a learning form borrowed from Socrates, in which we teach each other based on what we already in an organized and polite disscussion. That is the only class I have ever taken in which the teacher encouraged us to be free thinkers, further our learning by ourselves, and to pursue our interests. In fact, we once had a debate on whether Fantastic Beasts was \textbf{racist} or sexist because of an article that a student read. Our teacher assigned homework that night was to research the issue, form an educated response, and be ready to discuss it with the class the following day. Our generation believes that learning like that furthers us, and learning based on a test hinders us. In my school kids consistently get an unheathly 4 to 8 hours of sleep. Studies show that this effects our ability to learn immensely, as well as our \textbf{mental} heath, and physical growth. Not only are we physically tired, we are mentally tired. Tired of having to break down walls adults have thrown up, tired of putting up walls around adults because we are scared of our beliefs getting out. We just want it to stop.In my school, although we are depressed and sleep deprived and annoyed, we want to change the world. We have lofty goals and would do so much to accomplish them. I don't know what career I want, but I want to change the world. I want to make someone's life better, to put a smile on their face. I don't know what that is yet, but it might end up having something to do with the psychology field. I find it incredibly interesting. I know other kids do too, but none of us say anything, because when we do, people are concerned that we are depressed or need a therapist our self. Every kid I know has a passion for something. Every kid I know wants to change the world, to fix what the adults messed up. So yeah, we're a wreck. But we also have our heads on straight. Social media is not just an escape, but a learning system. We don't know if there's hope, but we want to make our own. So maybe we're better than you thought, or maybe we're worse. My friend gave me an interesting fact the other day: they used to put people on insane asylums based on stress levels. Based on tested fact and observation, almost all of our generation should be locked up by those standards. As a generation, we intend to change this, even if we lose everything in the process. That is what Gen Z is like. Depressed, but determined.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Millenial here. Dont you think the sleep deprivation thing is a \textbf{common} teenager thing? In my highschool and university years everyone was sleep deprived (and some at work even). My generation also suffers from general anxiety, i dont get how it became such an epidemic. Just yesterday we were almost 10 people between 25-30 and suddenly we realized almost all of us had major anxiety.And about depression for the future, i actually think things in some countries are going to shit but on the bright side i see people becoming more tolerant, more accepting, more united. So just give it time. Right now my generation is (or is becoming) the main work force and we are changing how we work, what is expected. Older people in businesses are being forced to change cause they need to retain young talent and we dont care about the corner office or that \textbf{dumb} stuff, we care about life quality. So yeah, basically, we still have hope :)I think we are going on the right direction. I just hope that when my generation gets into politics and become the presidents of our countries they will do things better. I still worry about how in some countries (mine included) people praise such \textbf{dumb} political figures. But idk, maybe the educated group of my generation will be the future presidents and your generation, that is more concerned about the world in general, will vote for them and we will see a brighter future :)Hope this helped somehow!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Common, Dumb & \cellcolor{green!27}Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}3/254 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.181 \\  \hline

I recently got into it and I'm terrified about the world that is given to us. So many adults in my life and on the news (of which I've seen) talk about the bad and the only thing I think of is 'Ok, how the hell can I change this?!' I have had many conversations about college, my main problem is not 'What do I want to do with my life?' rather, 'What can I do that will help?'  I am willing to learn and do whatever I possibly can to help the future of the world. I hope you become some sort of leader when you become of \textbf{age}. You should be going to 9th grade, right? You have a great way with words!

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I think the cut off point for gen z (as a gen zer) should be between 2006 to 08 because those born after that didn't experience the economic depression of 2008/9 and therefore will act quite differently from those born 1995 to 2006. Right now for a lot of the world, the economy is looking up and those kids who are between 10 and 6 rn will only know a childhood where their parents could afford to, say, buy the more expensive options in the store. Plus, as a sixteen year \textbf{old}, I would find it a little hard to believe that that a child born the same year that the iPhone 5 released will have a similar childhood to me (b.2002).\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}1/122 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.82 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Just gonna shout out that the speed at which technology developed between 1995-2012 was astronomical and there are very, very few similarities between the children born at each end of that spectrum. 1995-2003, and then 2004-2012+, would be much more appropriate. I was born in 2000, and am currently in university, and every encounter I've had with someone born after 2005 has shown how different our childhoods were. Obviously, those born closer to 2010 are still in their childhood, but there are some very fundamental differences in upbringing that make it impossible to compare our \textbf{age} groups. I distinctly remember a time when iPhones didn't exist. When the iPod nano was the greatest technology. When blackberries were the backbone of our \textbf{nation}, and how much the iPod Touch changed everything for kids. I burned CD's, my main "technological" form of entertainment was CD computer games, my family did weekly Friday trips to blockbuster for movie night, and I memorized the days and times my favorite shows would come on TV. Yes, using Word and Powerpoint and being able to do online research was integral to my schooling, but that was something we had to teach ourselves because adults were still learning too. Social media didn't exist; those without strict parents had MySpace, and then in late childhood had FaceBook (not me), but "Youtubers" didn't exist, "Instagram personalities" didn't exist. Technology was not integral to our social environment. Kids born in 2010 have phones at the \textbf{age} of 8, because that's what's normal. I see 10 year olds on Instagram, completely exposed to current celebrity culture and fashion and \textbf{crazy} representation of the ideal body/lifestyle, born in 2008; Instagram didn't even exist when I was 10, and the idealization of celebrities was not nearly as big, with the only way to keep updated being TigerBeat and Seventeen (magazines). Kids born in 2012 were given iPads to entertain them as babies. It bothers me to have my year get grouped in with 2004+ because we really don't have anything in \textbf{common}, yet experts who study generations have never recognized this.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Common, Crazy, Nation & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Nationality - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}5/348 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.437 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small What gets me mad is the fact that most adults think they know so much about technology, that "it's bad and will negatively affect our future generations". In some ways, yes it will. We can become more self-centered and their are bad uses to tech. But if you choose to use it properly, you can help create a better world for yourself and others. We now have access to things they didn't teach in school, we can work on any skill, anytime, and have a lot of opinions and things to see. We can change our views, and not just believe the things the people around us do. Before technology, we never really knew the consequences of our actions and people who haven't been traveling in the sea might not have noticed the trash that's washing up all over it. With our technology we can create positive change and influence others around us to do the same. We can communicate with people we might never would've been able to without tech. It has many bad sides such as cyberbullying, hate, and can be used for doing the opposite as mentioned in the good side.You can also share much media and this tremendously helps develop small companies (which also helps the economy). I think the world has been made into better place with technology, and we're finally starting to care more about solving world issues and fixing the environment. We've helped clean up what the last generation has left and are helping people and ecosystems worldwide through the use of technology. And hopefully our future generations will continue to do the same. Sorry for the very long comment, I just had to rant about this \textbf{common} misconception.EDIT: And yes, I do consider it unhealthy if you're on your phone too often. It can lead to depression and anxiety, and we need to balance it.

They are to quick to yell "I'm offended". We are to accepting. Anything goes.No morals.

Maybe before you comment on someone's living situation, get off your high horse. You were deprived of a proper education, free of religious bias. You were robbed of your right to learn how to think freely. You had to hang around a generation that has persecuted people based on who they love and what they believe. A generation that has polluted this earth near its breaking point. A generation that is incapable of taking responsibility. Lack of morality? That doesn't affect you. Since when does the \textbf{sex} life of others affect you?Best generation? Honey, they didn't do shit. They coasted off the fact that they were the children of the Greatest Generation (look them up), and then when it was their turn to lead, they messed almost everything up.Bad work ethic? Most of us throw away our youth and focus almost all our time and energy on school and employment, to the point where we don't have many friends, if any. Phones are useless? Do you know what we do on them? We read the news, make our planners, do our homework, research, get what social interaction we can, etc. Stop believing that you're better than us - because you've clearly had your view tinted by ideologies that have worn themselves \textbf{thin}, and have become what holds us back as a society.

So you have this generation, a generation of easily offended crybaby snowflakes known as Millennials who kind of made it to college who had been told that they're amazing and they're perfect every way that they were,when in reality none of them actually are. They went to college, accumulated thousands in student loans and then there was a reality check in the real world, and we have seen all kinds of problems with Millennials in the real world. They bitch, whine, and cry about getting paid low wages and not being able to get a job with their \textbf{gender} studies degree, after that they blame the system and vote Democrat in an attempt to create an impossible utopia. Where as Generation Z has been told the most horrendous things that you could possibly imagine due to the internet, a uncensored and unfiltered flow of information. Generation Z was the first generation to be born into the internet \textbf{age}, socially our parents or guardians were not able to protect us from the harsh reality of getting offended as so many parents of Millenials did. And as a result we have the outrage culture perpetuated by Millennial snowflakes, while Generation Z learned to be self reliant, and resilient. And this has many positive results on our generation, while Millennials tend to be optimists, Generation Z tends to be realist, Millennials want to be discovered while Generation Z want to work hard for success, In the realm of maturity Millennials tend to have a prolonged adolescence while Generation Z is "up-ageing".\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Gender & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/268 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.746 \\  \hline

A phone or Internet is just a device which makes our lives easier. When older generations say that we spend too much time on our phones i wonder if they realize all the things we actually do with a phone. Talking to friends, reading a book, doing reserch, making our planners, reading articles, watching videos and learning new things everyday. We are not just  doing useless things or simply wasting our time. Lots of us do use our phones for a lot of good. I don't see why phones can make people depressed. If anything it can help a lot of people having \textbf{mental} health issues as there are many things online which help you go through some of the things you go through. You can talk to someone who had gone through similar things that you are dealing with. And trust me i know that it's helpful. However, i think that many of us have mwntal health problems is because we are more open about it. I bet other generations also had lots of people with \textbf{mental} health issues but due to circumstances they didn't really believe it could happen or they weren't so open about it.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small While Gen Z doesn't seem like the best generation to many, I (being apart of GenZ) believe we will surprise many. We grew up in a world that's more connected than ever before, which means it's easier for people to be hurtful, but it also means many kids and teens are more aware what the world is like. We grew up in a world where being different is normal and is often celebrated and discrimination is seen as something awful. We grew up in a world where \textbf{mental} health messages are spread better so more people are aware of it and know they are not struggling alone. Sure there's a lot of violence happening but lots of that is caused by people from generations before us, and sure not everyone will grow up to be good, but I know many people my \textbf{age} and younger who want to make a difference in the future and hopefully change this sometimes scary, ugly world into something beautiful and loving.

First of all, I was born in 2001 and find that I have \textbf{nothing} in \textbf{common} in my childhood with those born anywhere near 2012, because I was already in middle school. Also, continuing to say that social media and phones wreck our generation is so confusing, because "Gen Z-ers" did not invent all of these things. We were raised with millennials and Gen X giving us technology and social media. If people over the \textbf{age} of 40 want to continue to say we are "ruined", they should consider WHO RUINED US IN THE FIRST PLACE. Children don't have access to advanced technology without being enabled by their parental figures. Every generation is a product by those that came before them. We are raised in a world that has been changed by people who lived prior. It's not like our generation is obsessed with technology because we wanted to be. Parents now give their kids iPads so they don't have to worry about them, as opposed to giving them creative outlets or encouraging them to advance their talents or finding new passions or simply playing outside! I myself was not raised like that - I played outside every single day and didn't have a phone until I started high school.

Mellenials all were born and mostly raised in a time of plenty early and so feel entitled and also later in life or upon adulthood a time of economic hardship that was heavily blamed on corruption or the capitalist system failing and so either don't trust the current economic system or the politicians and so believe the mostly progressive media that was required to cite sources when they were younger and so along with their \textbf{common} economic beliefs, they believe that social liberty is gone/eroded by older generations moving far too traditional that they believe restrict them -- often missing that currently politics have undergone a massive propaganda campaign for years and starting with mellenials is the first generation of people that mostly believe that part of each parties intent or principles aren't what they actually are, while baby boomers just have the highest amount of these people in a generation before, they confuse the two current parties when put into policy what the outcomes would be and sometimes even their principles, which is:The propaganda has tricked those into thinking only the government can provide services to all people and convinces people they lack rights. And with heavy economic regulation far beyond increasing competition, they stamp out the ability of most average people of having the ability to work on their own and then lower their wages while working for a company by increasing the labor force with third world immigrants that don't benefit americans currently.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small For SOME people, social media is linked with \textbf{mental} illness, but I hate that people link the growing rate of anxiety and depression with solely just technology. I believe that a big reason there is much more anxiety and depression within the younger generations is because of how the education system is changing. College used to be a place you could go to FURTHER your education if you wanted to better yourself and to get a better job. Now, college has basically become a necessity: if you don't want to work at fast food forever and live in a shitty apartment and live in poverty, you HAVE to go to college. It's so much harder nowadays to find a steady job without a college education. Plus, on top of that, college puts people into a lot of debt, because it's becoming more expensive and they can't afford it, but they NEED it. I feel like because of this, the schooling systems as a whole have really amped things up, specifically high school, and that's why we are seeing a lot more teenagers who struggle with anxiety and depression: not because they're lazy conceited idiots who are on their phone all the time, but because, I don't know, maybe pressures are growing and growing. I hate when older generations just blame everything on younger generations, instead of looking at how they've changed the culture themselves. EVERY generation has changed things, for better AND for worse.Thanks for coming to my ted talk lol\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Mental & \cellcolor{green!5}Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}1/252 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.397 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small to me, the strange part is how people presume that they can tell an entire generation what they're all about, even tho the oldest are only twenty-three and the youngest are six.   it's a little soon to put Zers into a box.also strange:  why 1995 and 2012?    who gets to determine that boundary and why?the stereotyping of a generation comes more from defining events experienced during their formative years:  great depression in 1930s,  ww2 in 1940s, korean war, large scale prosperity and economic growth, vietnam, energy shortages, mariel boatlift, iraq vs kuwait, arrival of dial up internet + brick phones, later arrival of broadband + social media + smart devices, 9/11, 2008 crash, michelle obama school lunches, and so on.  in the context of being in middle school during 2008 crash: a kid then would remember how their' parents were suddenly out of work or losing their homes.  even if they were a "rich kid", they saw it happen to others.   seeing entire neighborhoods of houses under construction become a no mans land after being suddenly abandoned.  coming home famished after school cos the obama lunches were both tiny and disgusting.shit like that during the formative years is, well, formative.  particularly when it's nationwide or worldwide.  it's entirely too soon to "define generation Z", yet those middle schoolers  i mention?  as adults in 2038, they'll base their actions/decisions on finances/work/voting/schooling/house/their own children partly on that 08 crash + obama lunches.  and someone of the same \textbf{age}, who is an otherwise complete stranger from across the country, will nod in agreement.that nationally formative commonality relating to specific years is how generations get their specific traits that we observe as 'stereotyping'.remember: stereotypes would not come about if they were not at least partly true\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/297 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.337 \\  \hline

Therefore we will have similar experiences during that time period, not the same because we were different ages. It's important to clarify that I didn't have a smartphone growing up, we had internet but I hardly used it. Many people think our \textbf{age} group grew up with smartphones but that is not the case. Anyway, my point is that there will be differences between each \textbf{age} group but I have more in \textbf{common} with your childhood than other childhoods, they aren't the same but they aren't that different.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Common & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}3/167 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.796 \\  \hline

The the internet and the world wide web came about when I was in grad school. Very helpful stuff! Anyway, I'm savvy because I fooled around with all this stuff back then and I never stopped playing with my toys. Devices, sure I can do that.

We're not hitting the traditional milestones at the same pace of previous generations, but that doesn't mean we're more immature or inexperienced as a whole.  I actually think that kids today are exposed to important and mature issues earlier than in the past.  Younger generations are just prioritizing those traditional milestones at different times, due to preference or necessity.

The U.S is pretty digitally driven amongst the youngsters and its pretty unhealthy at the way they consume it. Unnecessary conflicts arise through social media and then brought into real life.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small It's refreshing to see such insight in someone from my own generation younger than myself. (2001). As a whole our generation is actually more liberal than millennial's but is less inclined to support social justice. You see when you look at the hard facts on paper women have the same rights and privileges as men do and minorities have the same rights as white people do in the developed world (United States, Great Britain, France, Japan, South Korea, etc.). The differences we see between men and women in the roles they play are partly genetic and partly learned and while to some people that may be looked down upon or outright denied I believe in many ways femininity is a good thing. In the case of minorities the differences we see in their behavior are almost exclusively caused by their cultural background. In some cases the tolerance and multiculturalism supported by the developed world has resulted in conflict as the customs and beliefs of one culture are not compatible with the culture that accepts them. Rather than focusing on multiculturalism I believe we should follow the analogy of a melting pot as the United States is often referred to. Rather than dividing people into separate groups the cultures of the people that live there whether born there or having immigrated there should slowly coalesce peacefully combining elements of many cultures with people trying new things while not forgetting \textbf{old} traditions. The true strongest divider in the world is wealth though and the amount of money you possess or your family possesses can determine a lot more. I would like to go on but I need some sleep.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Capricorn Of January 4th Bakugou vs Deku congrats on being a kid, Idgaf if I hurt your feelings. It's not your fault but your generations and the generations that surround it have been ruining our world for years now. Unfortunately the generations effect each other. You kids rely to much on technology and your minds takes in to much information. And you soon come to realize \textbf{nothing} can be done to fix it.and you are but a mear Speke in this world. We are all mindless zombies blinded by money and material possessions.My belief is that if we take down governments and rid ourselves of a ridiculous currency system and rely on small communities to lead themselves with a trade based currency. We need to go back to living like natural humans. Hunting and tracking our food, instead of having to work a job to earn a price of paper that allows you to buy things that would normally come from the earth naturally. But all our natural resources have companies that control and run them now, and they make a killing off of selling what would normally be free. I want Gen Z to realize this and to fix it in the future. Or we will go down a long dark path of relying on the government and big business to keep us alive.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!27}1/226 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.442 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Money, houses, television, phones. Most people strive to have these things in life. While I choose to dream of a mud cabin in an empty wilderness, and \textbf{nothing} but me and nature going at it. All the things I listed at first have been compromised, taken over. Television is used to distract and entertain and it cost money. Money is earned by working, houses are earned with money and phones are what connects us to other people or places where we can spend more money or waste more time watching television or working.We all strive to have money? Why? Because it's the key to happiness right? Wrong, it's what our society has made to be important. If you all can't see that we live unnaturally then I have no hope for gen Z. Because we will remain lost and slaved for the rest our lives. Break the system, raise an army to over throw government, why couldn't we do these things? Imagine a natural world where your entertainment is walking down to the lake to take in a real view, and not watch it on YouTube. Imagine instead of earning the money to buy the food, you had the ability to track animals and grow your own food on land that you own outright and don't pay taxes on.

I have concerns many other millennials and most of gen Z got into technology too soon in their development. the internet is a useful tool but the things it allows you to access are not always appropriate. it can destroy innocence and there is the danger of being brainwashed by media to think, act and be someone you're not.

If my phone didn't die, I wouldn't have even bothered to talk to him. I went to the movies without my phone and became observant of what was around me. As much you might hate it, your \textbf{mental} health does get better when you get off your phone. You learn that the media blows everything up, you meet people, you learn more about the world. I'm not saying get rid of it, but spend less time then maybe you'd realize 'wow the world isn't too bad at all'. Social media influences us on what we should think and how we should act.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Armand Castilla Equal opportunity is not a good goal. People are always going to have to work harder in some things, and get it easier in others things. That's the way it should be. You're right about the thing with more male \textbf{engineers} for example, but if a male is born with an IQ ten points lower than another guy, he will have to study more and work harder than the other guy. Or if the guy was born a bit more gifted in mathematics. That's not an equal chance. You have to work harder for your chance. It's ok though because I think most people who are for equal opportunity really aren't. I think they just mean everybody CAN do it IF you work harder than the guy who was born having to work less for it. But that's obviously not equal at all so I think conservatives' use of the word "equality" is pandering to how far left the political "center" has gone. There are only certain situations where money for example shouldn't matter as much and more equal chance would be nice (like in school or sports), but money will always matter and to say otherwise just means you have to stop valuing capitalism or money and its worth at all.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small abc alqadiri I honestly don't know much about American politics, but I don't think the details are that relevant here. Liberalism is bad, because it makes it hard to have an opinion of your own. Liberal thinking has become a necessary thing to be considered a decent person. Don't get me wrong, you can be a classical liberal or at least not a hardcore liberal, but if you look at the movement itself (a. k. a. SJWs) you'll see that it's highly illogical, depends on feelings alone and can actually become so intolerant and straight up aggressive, that the people don't seem liberal at all anymore. That certainly doesn't characterise every liberal, but that is what drives liberalism and every sub-movement it has, like feminism and \textbf{L\textbf{G\textbf{BT}}}+. The thing is, if you don't actually research the political or philosophical movement you identify with, you can end up being simply brainwashed and as a result say a lot of stupid stuff. Because every real movement is interested in adding new members, therefore it's not unbiased, it doesn't give you freedom. That's why calling yourself a feminist and reciting a bunch of repeated phrases doesn't do any real good for the world, only create an illusion that people are fighting for the right thing. But who said changing the world for the good is easy?Basically, modern liberal ideology makes you \textbf{blind}. Because any ideology makes you \textbf{blind}. And I actually never specified that the 'healthy thinking' part is about conservatism or republicanism. Liberalism is the opposite to healthy thinking nowadays because it is currently dominating mainstream media. These days if you want to be seen as progressive you absolutely have to be a liberal. Only, truly progressive thinking can never be dominant in society. You have to risk being offensive by saying new stuff, if you want to actually move society forward. Liberals don't want you to understand that.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}ABC, Blind, LGBT & \cellcolor{green!27}Nationality - Chinese, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments, Sexual Identity - General, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality, Sexual Identity - Transexuality & \cellcolor{green!27}6/318 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.887 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I'd say what we are is apathetic, especially compared to millennials. Like the millennial teachers I have all really do seem to believe in that social justice warrior politically correct crap. Most of us Gen Z all realize that the political correctness has gone way overboard, and now we treat it like how people treated the social expectations of conservative etiquette a few decades ago. Essentially being politically correct is the new "show some manners" but now it's coming from the left instead of the right, and instead of being anti-rocknroll and anti-sex, its anti-cultural appropriation, and anti-microaggressions. They're all equally bullshit. We definitely are socially liberal, and our stance on gun issue seems to be pretty left (although since we also know \textbf{nothing} about guns that aren't on our xbox, our ideas for gun reform amount to banning the machine gun 1007 which killed about 3.5 people this year, while leaving machine gun 1-1006 as the same) we are more fiscally conservative however, and our attitude on foreign policy is basically1. Let's make friends with everyone through diplomacy and trade, always trying to avoid war.And 2. As long as no part of Mohammed Ahtmu lands on my shirt after the drone strike, the war on terror is just a part life (or death) And we don't seem to care/know too much about the constitution.We also aren't foaming at the mouth like Democrats are about Trump. Most of what Trump does we either laugh at, see as just some far away policy from D.C. that won't effect us, or don't know and don't care. And we don't seem to want Washington to be involved in our daily lives, we don't really trust them and see them as usually ineffective. Generally though you can still feel the inclination towards the left within Gen Z, but maybe that's more just me since I do live in silicon valley where everyone is already liberal.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small QUEEN TRISHA ok, I know my generation too. But do you know what are we going to be in the future? Conservative for our generation isn't the same as conservative for our parents or grandparents. The idea remains the same, but the world changes. Right now young conservatives are mostly a reaction to liberalism being overrated among "progressive" people. It only means that we chose to look at things from a more mature, experienced worldview. Of course, we are all trying to be smart, but it only makes sense to become more conservative when you see the world becoming too liberal. We are \textbf{old} enough to be interested in politics and young enough to be dissatisfied with the way our world is ruled. So, if you think about it, conservatives that we need today are not at all the conservatives we all know from childhood. And, the liberals, that we all consider ourselves to be, are not at all that progressive anymore. With that logic, "liberal" is the new conservative, and "conservative" is the new progressive. And, by the way, if you haven't thought about it, the world will always be devided into conservative and liberal. Our biggest priority is not to choose either side, but to seek balance between the two. We have to learn from each other and learn to compromise in order to preserve peace.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}1/228 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.439 \\  \hline

In 2 years the first kids who were born after 9/11, to whom it is only history they learned about, are gonna be turning 18 and becoming productive members of society. For Millennials 9/11 was a big historical event and had i just been a year younger i probably wouldnt have even been \textbf{old} enough to accurately remember where i was during 9/11. My 2nd grade classroom. The teacher had the lights off and the news on. We spent the day watching the twin towers falling on repeat. A couple kids were crying but i didnt really know what was happening. I dont think any of us did. All we knew was it wasnt good.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}3/172 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.744 \\  \hline

First of all, historians are the main people who define which group of people is a "generation," and they can't do that until a generation has pretty much lived their lives, e.g. around retirement \textbf{age}. 🤦 Second, a new generation needs to be birthed by the preceding generation. For example, the Baby Boomers are children of the Silent Generation.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Alright, yeah I was born when the Internet existed but everything changed after 2005 it seems. My childhood is much different from those born after 2005. I can see it with my own eyes. We were not centered around technology as kids, these kids are always on their technological devices. Life was different for us. Even the cartoons we watched, it's like everything has changed. Either 1995-2005 is a short generation of its own, or Generation Z itself has two different stages. In addition, both of my parents are Generation X. There is a flaw in the Generation timeline. I usually put those born before 2005 in the late Millenial stage. Though our experiences are still different from other Millenials, its closer to them than Generation Z. Comparing someone born in 1989 to someone born in 1999, there are noticable differences, but not that much. However, someone born in 1999 and someone born in 2009 have a much bigger gap. Significant differences where you can tell they aren't from the same generation. Therefor I go back to my original statement. Either 1995-2005 is another generation its own, or its some sort of \textbf{transition} stage between Millenials and Generation Z (which basically would make it another short generation).\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Transition & \cellcolor{green!5}Sexual Identity - Transexuality & \cellcolor{green!5}1/207 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.483 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small First of all, Left wing Millennials in general tend to promote this unhealthy idea of "whoring" around due to the \textbf{sexual} liberation idea of the 3rd wave feminism. The feminizing of men and "machoing" of females will only deteriorate society since biologically, men tend to seek for young looking women (more fertile) and so, because of the multiplicity of partners and postponed marriage without settling down, the majority of Millennials today will find themselves "lonely" after their peak years pass away without a partner. Females tend to look for men who are confident due to the illusion that confidence correlates with power (better chance for protecting and providing for their children). So females tend to look for partners whom they think will be strong enough to raise their children. The feminization of males will only make men less "attractive" to females, thus reducing the number of successful relationships in the present. In addition, due to the late "waiting" of marriage and the probability of a female having already experienced multiple partners, the bonding effect caused by the release of chemicals after intercourse is severely reduced, making them less susceptible to successfully attract and keep men  more often. In addition, the loss of production of testosterone in males due to the lack of physical activities (excersising increases the production of testosterone) will only make them more unattractive for females and lose pheromones to attract females. In other words, there will be a lack of children in the future which means less revenue in taxes to pay for social programs such as welfare (especially since more people will be retiring without dying, and thus there will be a lack of money to pay for the pensions and social security for these people). Underpopulation will be a severe crisis in the future in 1st world countries. Some people say that overpopulation is a problem... which indeed it is... in 3rd world countries, not in 1st world countries. So by not having children, these people in 1st world countries will eventually bring the demise of the US, Europe, and Asian countries (just look at Japan) while the nations with the most population will govern the world in politics, such as the Middle Eastern countries - Muslim nations - and India as well as other non-feminized men/non-machoed females nations. This defeats the whole purpose of progressive movement since those countries which will take the lead in the world tend to oppress minorities and hated opponents, such as in the Middle East (where rape is legal). Of course, some say China will take the place of US so maybe it will be influenced by it more, unless, of course, China's economy is unable to recuperrate from the financial crisis they are about to experience (a future Real Estate crash in the chinese market due to the dependency on Chinese's real estate government laws).The point is that we need to act now if we want to prevent a catastrophy like this.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Sexual & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/495 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.202 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I admit, I over exaggerated the economic downfall of the world etc., but the unhealthy consequences done by today's "progressive" movement (I personally call it regressive) is a real problem. For example, due to them, they have achieved the reduction of time of "recess" in schools since they claim it is benefitial (more time in school) but it has been proven that recess time is actually very healthy for males since it gives them an opportunity to do physical activities and increase their production of testosterone in a healthy manner. Also, this helps "control" the children with ADHD more since it gives them a chance of exhausting that energy in playtime. Making them "sit" down for hours without breaks actually makes their symptoms worse. Females, on the other hand, are encouraged recently by modern way feminists to pursue powerful activities and "demonize" any past female activities since according to them it only "oppresses" them. They discourage them from accepting \textbf{common} courtesy manners and indoctrinate them to fear men (this is an irrational fear). In fact, there was a study made which found that the main reason that females tended to avoid STEM fields even though they liked it was not due to opportunities in the field (they are encouraged actually), instead, they refused to join due to an irrational fear that they would be discriminated even though in actuality, it does not happens. When asked where did they heard these fake news (since STEM is actually very welcoming to females) they answered that they heard it from feminist propaganda. When you continuously repeat a lie, eventually, you will start to believe it, and this is just what happened in STEM. Feminist propaganda is the reason why there is a lack of females in STEM fields. Also, the "machoing" of females only increases the testosterone in females which, by the way, a high level of testosterone in females gives them a higher risk for obesity, heart disease, and diabetes, thus, in the future, my prediction is that females will begin to die off younger than in previous generations. We still do not see this since today's older generation is composed of Baby Boomers which had, at least in the development in hormones, a healthy upbringing (not psychologically of course).\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Common & \cellcolor{green!5}Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}1/378 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.265 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small krishna L rich kids depressed, poor kids depressed, we are all depressed. I think it's because of the unreal expectations put on us (my school is impossibly competitive, everyone's self medicating to deal with the stress). We are supposed to be the gen to make everything better, and yet I get told "Y'all teenagers are so self righteous. You don't have to work for anything. Entitled brats." We live in a world of contradictions. Be idealistic. Dream Big. But we see all of those ideas fail and watch our parents and our friends parents lose their jobs and such. That's why we're realistic. We are more intelligent (average SAT scores increase yearly), but are constantly being told that we are \textbf{dumb}. And we inherited a world destroyed by the mistakes of others. \textbf{Racism}, \textbf{sexism}, \textbf{homophobia}, terrorism, global warming, gun violence, political corruption, social upheaval. All of that is why we are more fluid and accepting in our beliefs . If somebody is \textbf{homophobic}, they'd be the one I'd stare at in disbelief. Recycling is a thing at my school, and we are concerned over the environment and the humanitarian crisis. My friend group consists of whites, blacks, latinos, Asians, and Indians, and all I care about are their personalities and interests. Skin color has never been a factor for my gen.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Mosin Cieblene we need more deregulation not less. I'm part of generation Z  living in one of the most regulated places in the country, Bay Area (Silicon Valley) California, and it fucking sucks. Everything is way overpriced, and much of the decisions to what risk we want to take or what we want to buy are made by some of the most privelaged arrogant people. I've had multiple moments where my phone is about to die, so I decide to pick up a newspaper while I'm waiting  for something and every fucking time their is a story about how after 10 years of construction, going through every hoop to pass all the regulation, getting the approval from multiple government officials from different agencies, using all the right material that meets the environmental standards, and spendng millions of dollars on its construction, a building which was supposed create dozens of new jobs and make things easier for the consumer or set of desperatly needed new housing complex, gets blocked because some bitchy neighbor decided that he/she doesn't like the cars on the sidewalk or shape of the buiding, so compalins to the city counsel, and just like that, contruction is put to a halt, and another 2 years are added to the time table,  and when it does finally get completed, the business will often end up leaving because prices and taxes make more too expensive  make it less expensive to sell the place than actually trying to run the business. It took one year to build the empire state building, and now it takes 4-6 years just to build a new highway. The only businesses that thrive here are the tech companies, which have almost \textbf{ZERO} REGULATIONS.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Yeah but we are different from the millennial style of liberals, I can tell from talking to the older guys (and especially the women) including our very young teachers that the millennials are way more sincere and genuine about their liberal beliefs, always trying not to offend people, really believing that everyone is truly good and innocent, and thinking that all we need to do is be kind and independent and celebrate our diversity in order to make the world perfect for everyone. Generation Z is more apathetic, most of us are part of the politically correct culture only in the formal sense, I.E. we all know that the when your talking to the class, at serious work meeting with the boss, or on camera, you talk very superficially  like a person on CNN, MSNBC, or a white house official from the Obama administration, making sure to note your tolerance and utmost desire to achieve whatever the goals are of the topic they are addressing at the mandatory presentation in the school auditorium - \textbf{sexual} abuse, alchohol, suicide. But once you leave you go back to your real self, swearing and with most students altering 0 of their attitude or beliefs, not even showing any signs that we just came from a presentation on a super depressing and serious topic except for the almost amused impressions at how we had to go to this \textbf{lame} assembly being led by people who actually think that they are going to change anything instead of just being some mandatory bureaucratic event that makes us (them) feel better and cover their asses. And for a noticable amount of people, there is even some resentment that we are basically being forced by our schools into an indoctrination assembly. This goes along with our rather low expectations of our current government (and I mean government in general, not just Trump) We also don't really feel invested in the successful ideal outcome of most movements. And even though most of generation Z naturally tilts left/liberal most of us are actually pretty accepting or at least used to of not very leftward policies and trends, like we don't get shocked or emotional about school shootings unlike our parents, we actually had a false alarm a month ago where the principal said someone with a gun was in our school, and to me at least it didn't seem particularly scary or dangerous, I figured it was most likely a false alarm, and even if it wasn't the chances of my class getting picked would be very small. Or the U.S war on terror and use of drones in Pakistan, most would probably say that we shouldn't be a as jumpy to launch a drone strike, and that it could do more damage than good in the long run;,  but almost all of us seem to accept it as something that is part of life (or an end of life for some Pakistanis) which we rarely have to think about. It's not that we don't have morality, it's just that what goes on in the middle East is so far away and doesn't really effect our daily lives, so whatever happens to the life of Mohammed Ahtmu in Pakistan or one of the other countries we are bombing really isn't one of our priorities. And as for Trump, although most of udissaprove of him like the rest of the younger generations, most of us aren't seething at the mouth like Democrats, we look at his policies or statements and mostly just laugh. Even even though there is definitely a PC culture, there isn't really a feeling of being pulled into the democratic camp or Republican camp, both are pretty \textbf{lame} to most people. We don't really trust the government to be effective, or efficient, or sincere, or to be able to make our lives that much better; our interest is in the tech companies and the idea of being the CEO of a startup company and going to a prestige university. Combine this lack of faith in the government, and this individualistic entrepreneur attitude, and I've actually found that at least in my experience, most of us can agree that although Bernie Sanders is cool and definitely has conviction and good intentions, we kind of agree that his expectations are unrealistic given the trouble we have with just trying to keep the government open. This is Not to say that we don't support the environment or think that it is necessary to do all that we can to save the earth and solve our problems, it's just were not really expecting to make big momentous gains or achievements that we will feel in our daily lives through most of these programs like preventing \textbf{sexual} assault, solving racial inequality, making things cheaper, cleaning the environment. We generally expect and accept mitigation, not revolution, although there are topics where we seem to think we will be able to make radical changes like gun control and immigration, but these are often the ones with the most vague goals and least understanding of the facts,  like knowing what makes a gun an assault rifle, that a pistol kills the most people in America, that the NRA is relatively tiny compared to big pharma, that there are very large parts of the country and public that will make it nearly impossible  for the House and Senate  to pass meaningful gun reform legislation. Or most of generation Z not knowing that being an illegal immigrants  can literally means being a second class citizens similar to the status of freed slaves after the civil war; that our immigration population as a percentage of our total population is at near historic heights; that this cycle of dealing with DACA kids and their parents will continue unless you have tougher immigration security; that if we were to make our immigration system more merit based and designed to include how well the immigrants would adapt and prosper in American society like Canada's system, we would have less people coming from Latin America and less family members and children, instead having more workers from Asia; and that as sad as the average life of \textbf{refugee} is, most of the Syrians aren't very tuned into western values like freedom of speech, women's rights, not being antisemitic, etc. I feel terrible for the Syrians and their situation, but instead of just listening to people who aren't experts talk on MSNBC, CNN, or Fox, I actually looked what the statistics are, what the mainstream beliefs of people in the region like Egypt, Jordan, lebanon and Turkey. What percentage of them say yes to imprisoning \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} people for being \textbf{g\textbf{ay}}, or say yes to killing people who leave their religion, or yes to women having unequal status under the law, etc. It's not just the fringe, and would probably cause even more Trump backlash in America if they were allowed to come in massive numbers, as has been the case elsewhere, so although though I don't agree with Trumps muslim ban, I do understand why some people are saying that we should let Europe handle the \textbf{refugee} crisis. And yet when I say this to my class citing ever statistic and its source, and only suggesting that we should be more cautious about the unamerican beliefs that are being held by the group than we normally would before we let them in, it's like they don't even hear what I'm just saying, and imagine that instead of having cited statistics with credible numbers about people from the region, they imagine that I had said that all Syrians are \textbf{terrorist} and suggest that the people in the surveys were lying about having dispicable beliefs and are actually very good people,  one of the dumbest things I've ever heard.  But overall Generation Z are like millennials in that we generally have the same inclinations and beliefs, however we are more individualistic and don't actually have as much faith in either the government's ir the excessive and annoying liberal social justice warriors. And there is definitely growing resentment over all this mandatory social justice programs and getting pretty tired of these unnecessary expenses like the new law in california that requires solar panels for all new homes.  If a significant portion of our generation were vote conservative, it would have to be after an aggressively overbearing and liberal leader and the emergence of a new conservative that would be libertarian on social issues, promise stability and clarity, points out all political bullshit and the ugly facts, promises to decrease the economic/government restraints, push the entrepreneurial spirit, stands out for his conviction and strong opinions, believes in science, and can appeal to the independents, think of someone with the balls of and style of Trump, the promises of Rand Paul, and the moderate appeal and politics of Bill Clinton.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gay, Lame, Refugee, Sexual, Terrorist & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General, Nationality - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments, Religious Identity - Muslim, Sexual Identity - General, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality & \cellcolor{green!27}11/1480 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.743 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small James Dutile I don't think you fully grasp it. I don't mean this in a rude or condescending way, but I think a lot of people in the western world don't understand it since we've been the freest in the world. Under socialism there is complete control over the economy, something that these "socialist" Scandinavian countries aren't doing. They allow elements of a free market, which isn't socialist. When people think of socialism the tend to think of social services really, and for the Scandinavian countries they do have more services, however they don't pay for a military because we are their protection. When you don't have to pay for your defence you can use a large amount of taxes for health care and etc. But these countries don't have nearly as good as health care as in the U.S.  because of our free market companies must compete to get business, so they need to lower prices, provide the best service, and innovate to stay in business. Socialism doesn't take that into account. When there is 1 force controlling a service they don't have to compete or innovate because they're the only service. Why make something more affordable or better when people will have to go to you by default? In fact \textbf{doctors} are leaving these countries because there's no incentive to be a doctor when you don't get paid much by the government, so these countries are now losing \textbf{doctors}. One of the appeals to that career is the money and without it what's the point of going through med school and going through all that effort. Another problem is that the  Scandinavian countries have a way smaller population. Truly socialist countries look like Venezuela, where the government took full control of their natural resources and made the prices extremely high, so no foreign people invested in it. There was no point in buying Venezuelan oil when you can get it somewhere else far cheaper. Also with a socialist government many people in the government don't understand economics. They spend way too much on social services. It's also harder for them to price things like food, because in a capitalist market the consumer sets the price based on demand, because of this companies try to meet the demand to get the customer. Thats what happened in China under Mao. Part of the 50 to 80 million deaths under his rule had to do with people starving to death for that reason. Another problem with socialism is that the government is pretty much the one making all decisions in your life. This greater good mentioned earlier sounds nice but it isn't. There isn't individuality. You may lose all your money because the government thinks its best going to someone else. That's theft. Taxes are government people coming to your house and taking money at gunpoint. If you refuse you go to jail or might be killed. So even in theory it's wrong because it isn't you deciding to give money for the good of humanity, it's the government stepping in and taking it from you whether you like it or not.  Basically I could argue that me taking your hard earned money is for the greater good because I'm hungry, which wouldn't be moral because it's your money and I have no right to take it. Lastly, socialism is not like democracy. True democracy is mob rule which never works because the ever changing will of the majority take the rights away from the minority. Socialism is government control of the economy. Anyways I know this is a long comment and if you read this far thanks for taking the time to read this.

The oldest Gen Z is 23 right now, which mean only 5 years of Gen Z are adults who have experienced life in the fullest. Even at that, only a sliver of life has been experienced. Including children to speak for the generation, how they think and behave is wrong because they are still developing critical thinking skills and growing mentally and physically.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Suprajira Morakot I just explained why you would exclude the younger generation in detail, why would you ask again? A generation can't be solidified based on actively changing variables, thus you ask people who are for the most part set in stone about their way of life (adults). While it is valuable to gather information about how kids behave, they do not represent the final product of the generation because they are constantly changing every aspect of their life until they enter adulthood and even until their mid twenties. Asking young kids questions they don't know how to answer realistically completely defeats the purpose when they don't have a grasp on the real world. That's not an insult it's just a part of growing up. The face of the generation is the workforce currently, 18+ they are making real world impacts and they are how people perceive the generation as a whole because it's well understood that kids develope for a long time before they can offer wisdom and confidence in themselves and their peers. These kids will get asked questions and for input when they reach the stage of their lives with they impact the world, which they don't do as mere children alone. \textbf{Nobody} is limiting their opinion or voice, but we will take it with a grain of salt because kids flip flop on topics all the time, and we need concrete answers when they are more mature. I am Gen Z in my twenties, I actively impact what others perceive of Gen Z because I am in the workforce with 3-4 other generations, THAT is what I am implying. \textbf{Nobody} will take you as you are as a kid because you change every year as you grow, but you remain relatively the same as an adult.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nobody & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!27}2/300 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.667 \\  \hline

Not all of us have \textbf{mental} disorders or act fully stupid. Like someone mentioned before me, the internet just allows you to see us do more stupid stuff because we can post it wherever. Also I've seen studies and even had a psychology teacher explain that older generations use their phones more in a day. Also people born in the 50's had extra carbon in their DNA from all the nuclear bomb tests at the time, so there were problems with them mentally. Doesn't mean they're a terrible generation though.

Obviously.But the general generation will be in their 20s, which can easily be grouped together with some young 30 yr olds and older teens. Kind of like millennials a few years ago.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Max Ramos I've noticed people born in 1997 relate more to millennials and those born in 1999 relate more to Gen Z.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Melanny R. Martinez wym? From what I've seen that's the case. Very few people my \textbf{age} identify as millenials and very few people from '97 and before think they're gen Z. There's a few commenters on here from 95 and 96 who say they have gen Z traits, but irl they're still millennials. 1999 is completely different bc everyone irl just knows they aren't a millennial cuz we're just farther away from them cultural and \textbf{age} wise.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/77 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.597 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Yeah, your generation is way to deep in your phone screens, with attention span of 6 seconds (vines? Anyone?) And no social, actual face to face skills, you live in a digital world where everything is fake, everything is made up to be up to ideal standards you had in your head which it not real and almost not feasible, and when real life hits with no filters, no pictures enhancements, you feel depressed because you have no experience outside your phone's. oh and your obsession with instant gratification, And no values whatsoever, everything is blended with everything and \textbf{nothing} makes sense anymore.And don't start on the work place, non of you (even lots of us millenials) have discipline, no responsibility, \textbf{nothing}, you expect everything to happen just because you FEEL it should, you don't even put in the effort to make it happen, or maybe you just rally/riot (UC Berkeley antifa idiots)/yell/shout/defame on twitter/start a hashtag (the stupid metoo)/post a video on Facebook and make it all emotional and all about YOU, it's like you are the center of the universe, you don't even bother to have a civil conversation anymore. Everything is about bullshit equality regardless of merit and qualifications. These are all made to pander to your fragile feelings and emotions, instead of toughening you up to be ready to face real life, because boy..... Real life will crush you, and \textbf{nobody} cares about you little safe space rainbow unicorn bubbleSomething is wrong happend along the way and if we don't start working on it, you gen zer's will be the doom of everyone. I envy generations in the past who had discipline and order, and had goals, rather than fake dreams. And I don't blame you only, I blame US millenials, and I blame the generation before us, who thought making everything available instantly to us will give us a happier life, instead we turned to little bratty entitled shitheads with no respect for anything and anyone, selfish, arrogant, and stupid\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nobody, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}3/337 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.89 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Gen Z behaves the way it does because the world we live in makes us this way. Im 1998 and I kinda call BS on the work/life blend 7 days a week thing. Precarious work is a very real threat so I would say we are always in the process of advancing our credentials due to capitalistic competition. I also think with the advent of technology human work is becoming fabricated for the sake of the economy. Since the \textbf{transition} to the service industry, it seems technology is allowing us to pursue more intellectual work which naturally lends itself towards the hobby territory. My point is I think that this video  credits too much individuality to Gen Z.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Transition & \cellcolor{green!5}Sexual Identity - Transexuality & \cellcolor{green!5}1/118 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.847 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Im not entirely sure how the 24/7 work life blend goes against the advancing credentials, unless you're offering an explanation for it and say we work 24/7 because we're always in school or teaching ourselves something. Is that it? I 100 agree with the fabricating jobs for the economy, I've thought about that a bunch before. I also find it interesting how we fabricate jobs but outsource many jobs because capitalism has always relied on cheap/free/slave labor in America to function so that the rest can live in better conditions so it's like we're saying 'WE NEED JOBS' but also 'ooo but not those kinds of jobs (because then we'd have to pay a livable wage and increase the cost of \textbf{common} goods)'\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Common & \cellcolor{green!27}Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}1/123 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.813 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Whether or not capitalism is "good" or has "worked" says \textbf{nothing} about its sustainability or how it will adapt to major changes in how the economy is driven, such as automation.Whatever you want to call it, I think we will see a move towards a shorter, more flexible working week with more job sharing and overall less consumption. People will become less hostile towards \textbf{zero} hours contracts and skills/labour will be pooled into a more fluid marketplace rather than individual companies.
