  \cellcolor{green!27}\small It was \textbf{common} for girls to have babies later in their teens, but not so much at 13. Girls typically didn't even start menstruating until their mid or late teens at that time. It is thought that puberty began later back then because people (especially those who were working class) were more sickly and undernourished. Only since about the mid-20th century, when healthcare and nutrition began to vastly improve, has it been more \textbf{common} for girls to start menstruating in their preteens and very early teens. The average \textbf{age} for girls to start their periods now is 12. Most sources suggest that it was between 14 and 16 in the 1800s. Which again, means that a lot of 13 year olds wouldn't have even been capable of getting pregnant.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Common & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}3/129 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.326 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Iteboheng Langeni yeah unfortunately that's a thing :- no need to judge, it does seek \textbf{crazy} but it can be done out of fear, disbelief, anger, sadness, or if you're in an abusive household where until the very last second they can't do anything about it... or if you know your family would pressure you into an abortion then you hide it because you just can't get one for numerous reasons ( whether that be its illegal or you're against it yourself or you can't do that to yourself etc. ) and then you have the baby last second. Personally I understand, but I find it INCREDIBLY disrespectful since her parents just don't know at all and then suddenly have a grandchild in the house?? It'd take even LONGER for the tensions to rise and/or for the parents to cope with it, and that'd be when the baby's born instead of whilst she's pregnant and they become okay towards the end or so of her pregnancy.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I agree that she had to learn to accept the consequences of her actions and grow into a more mature person, but I still feel bad about her birthday. Ofcourse she got upset over the presents - suddenly she is a mum which is a role she is NOT ready for, she has a baby which seeks all her attention and to top it all off everyone else looks at her as a mum - not just herself too. Adults mostly don't want a kid before their 30s today because they're scared to 'lose themselves', so it's pretty clear how a 13/14 year \textbf{old} would feel about that.
