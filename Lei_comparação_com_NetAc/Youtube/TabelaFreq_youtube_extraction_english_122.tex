  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I don't think we treat \textbf{old} people like babies, we do the best we can taking care of those who depend on us. Babies depend on us so we treat them like the dependents they are. We treat our elders like the dependent they become. That's not \textbf{ageism}, \textbf{Ageism} is when the reason for the behavior is \textbf{age}. There is plenty of \textbf{old} people who are autonomous and we treat them as such.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Never noticed that \textbf{elderly} are generally being belittled like that by calling them "sweety"  "honey" here. Is that maybe typically American? Yes, I've seen dropping of vocabulary 'difficulty' where it made sense: talking to someone with a form of dementia like Alzheimers... They actually understand less (degenerative disease) and sometimes act childish, so they get treated accordingly.Just like not every \textbf{ageing} person's \textbf{mental} abilities decline, not every other person acts like a condescending a*hole to them... the title and to some extent the video itself implies everyone treats \textbf{old} people like babies.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small As someone who is middle-\textbf{age} let me tell you the gap between young and \textbf{old} is less than you think. You will wind up \textbf{old} before you know it.  If you're a teenager reading this remember that you will spend the majority of your life not as a young person.  Last I don't believe there is any such thing as an adult, we are all merely older children.Also \textbf{ageism} is a very real reality in the workplace despite it's illegality. And it's practiced by everybody including \textbf{old} people themselves.  Case in point, the CEO at a company I used to work for did not like to be around people his own \textbf{age}, which was definitely \textbf{old}.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Ageism, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}6/117 & \cellcolor{green!5}5.128 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Humans are soooo complex and sensitive. We're lucky to still be around, and who knows how much longer.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small "How about the \textbf{elderly} being aware they may be talked to like babies and letting it pass." I mean...you don't think that's basically exactly what they do every day? They do let it pass. Constantly. You virtually never see an \textbf{old} person actually getting defensive about this or even bringing it up in life. But someone makes one 3 minute video about it and everyone else gets butthurt.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I tell ya why.....because when you drive a god damn 5 ton cadi and you just lunge into another lane and dont look, then you cream someone and don't even know it because your on so many pills and your not clear on where you are or what's going on then yeah I gotta talk to you slowly and simply.no high level convos when your not even sure what's going on at any one moment. I live in Fort Myers and every winter all the snowbirds come down and the accidents go through The  roof and all these \textbf{elderly} people who have no business being on the road hurt and kill people. Why? Because me and Maud wanted to go to The Costco to get a 12 pack of meat? Seen this for 40 yrs. Idc what this video says. Your all doped out on pills how can I not talk to you like a baby?\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Elderly & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}1/156 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.641 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small While treating anyone with condescending tone isn't appropriate, I think the society today is extremely different than, say, 100 years ago. But first of all, this video has a serious flaw: what exactly is "\textbf{old} people?" Quite frankly, no one can deny the huge difference between a 65 years \textbf{old} person and a 95 years \textbf{old} one, therefore, wouldn't it be inappropriate - and quite condescending - to group them under the same category in the first place? Take my grandma for example. When she was 65, she was really strong and healthy and could take care the house in a way that no one else could in my family. But now, when she is in her 90s, not only it is already difficult for her just to stay awake, but mentally she has lost the sharpness she had at 65 and has become agonizingly stubborn. So really, this video asks and answers a wrong question in the first place. Especially nowadays the average life span has become so ....."\textbf{old}?" that it is not uncommon for people to live nearly a third of their lives as "\textbf{old} persons" while the society is changing ever so quickly that "\textbf{old} experience" becomes obsolete in just a couple decades in many cases.Aging is a gradual process.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Umm. It depends. \textbf{Old} people deteriorate, some lose memory, muscles, bodily functions. It difficult to treat them in a way where a lot can be expected from them.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Age comes with ailing health, loss of physical ability and cognitive decline. These are all factors we consider weaknesses and as humans we have an innate tendency to infantilize those that exhibit these ailments. I'm certain at its most pronounced form it's insulting to an older person but doesn't current evidence suggest for most that it might apply to, the ability to recognise this type of treatment is low.I think I'd prefer to listen to more older people on the matter, which I suspect the comments section to be largely absent of.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/93 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.075 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small But young people get sick too. According to your logic, sick people and older people are in the same category. What I'm saying is you can't equate \textbf{age} with illness because young people get sick and a lot of \textbf{old} people, like my grandmother, reach 80s with no ailments to speak of. She still works part time at her church lol I'd like to see you tell her she's \textbf{old} and sick.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}3/72 & \cellcolor{green!5}4.167 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@S***** Not at all because that was never my logic, I never mentioned sick people at all. People can be in different states of health throughout life without reasonably concluding somebody is "sick." What I did say was that there is inevitable cognitive decline that comes with \textbf{age}, it doesn't have to be dementia or Alzheimers for it to be considered cognitive decline. It is a fact that \textbf{elderly} people start to lose their ability to detect sarcasm and other forms of subtle communicative tells. There is never a one size fits all rule here, nor was I suggesting that there was. It's rather bizarre to me that is what you extrapolated from my comment. If anything it was to direct attention to reasons why society might tend to infantilise \textbf{elderly} people, not a suggestion that it should be done.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Elderly & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}3/140 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.143 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small That aging comes with physical and \textbf{mental} decline is one of the biggest myths that culture, society and the media and the medical industry has forced people to believe. Being ill is not normal. Being ill in older \textbf{age} is not normal. Being sick as one gets older is based on the choices people make that interfere with their body and mind and the reaction to something that is not normal.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The sad truth is that most of over pessimistic people that think bitcoin will bottom on \$3000 or lower, \$1000, or even \textbf{zero} should check themselves out of fairy tale story.. The bear market is beginning to end cos it is already exceeding the longest bear market in history. Time to accumulate cheap btc before it is too late, but what happens if it keeps skyrocketing to maybe its new all time high? That will be really great for an hodler. What if it falls again in a false bull run? The losers would be those holding coins and the winners would be the profiting trader because with his initial portfolio, he would have turned over profit maybe even as high as 400 and that is what investment is actually all about, making profit. There is somewhat a bullish sign but its not good enough to place a bet on. The most favorable approach is to buy more coins now and then, find a way to multiply your holdings so eventually when the bulls become stronger, we would have amassed a fair amount of bitcoins. Using this approach has been great for me because it has helped me avoid unnecessary expenses as i channel a certain percent of my earnings to trading and consequently,increasing my holding base in cryptocurrency.

I suppose if it's a cultural thing and just said generally to people, it's no big deal. If dear, honey, sweetie are used with a kind tone and intention, I have no problems with those nicknames. Certain people are affectionate in their speech and call lots of people sweetie. It's different when those names are used as a come-on to be more intimate with someone the speaker isn't close to, who may not feel comfortable with those pet names. Or used with a sarcastic, condescending, or passive-aggressive tone and intent. It's usually pretty clear by the message that the speaker/writer is using the names to hit on or to demean the other. But with an \textbf{elderly} person, asking, "Can I get you anything else, sweetie?" seems like something a caregiver, server, nurse, etc would say with concern for the other person.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Yes. Your 3 year \textbf{old} could list off all the presidents and braches of government, speak different languages, explain HOW something works, explain the ecosystem. But so many parents put limitations on their children. Only teaching shapes, numbers, colors, etc. It's all in what system is put in place for that child. Imagine being taught about interest rates and bills early? My mother let me circle the things I wanted in the TOYS R US catalogue  but she also handed me the bills at the same time so I learned how to write checks out correctly and pay bills!
