\begin{itemize}\item Taking into account the words that were detected, we can reach the conclusion these comments are associated with : : Ethnicity - General;Ethnicity - Black;Gender - General;Age - Youngsters;Nationality - British;Social Class - Working class;Nationality - General;Ethnicity - White;Ethnicity - Asian (East- China, Japan, Korea, Philippines, Vietnam);Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments;Ethnicity - Native-American; Ideological and Political Identity - General;Age - Over 65s;%.

\item The percentage of hate speech related words is 3.4275.

\item Considering that the variable \textbf{Ethnicity - General} has the most occurences in the post, we can interpret that this is the predominant hate speech.

\item Overall there were 193/230 occurences of hate speech related comments.\end{itemize}\end{document}
