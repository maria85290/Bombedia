  \cellcolor{green!27}\small You can have a box in your brain and not need to be a man or a \textbf{woman}. I believe we are unique and we must give ourselves value so we can live better and others will see it and they will appreciate us. It is important to remember where we come from and come back to nature and '\textbf{old} style' if we feel lost. Teamwork is the key to me. We don't need to create a war to see who's better if men or women. We have high intuition as a female and they get better oriented. There are many activities that should be done by each one. Our bodies are designed differently. It's like being ring and shoe size 7 and trying to fit 6 or 8. As a \textbf{woman} we can go to school, work outside the house, pay our bills, maintain our kids, everything alone and because of that men are not gentlemen anymore. I don't understand how looking for freedom we just lost commitment and kindness. I'm a \textbf{woman}, independent, bilingual, with some college and I just would do anything to be treated with respect and kindness as \textbf{old} women from the past were treated. Women that without going to school, with no liberty, with no knowledge about home activities, I mean doing homework themselves, they got a position in society and lived their lives as it supposed to be at that time. It's so sad to see our future. Maybe we won't speak in future, just push keys on a screen to get what we want. It's depressing. I hope things change and even though money it's very important and keeps order there's still value out there. Nature doesn't cost a cent. It exists to be appreciated, to be lived, and to make us understand the real meaning of life.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Old, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}4/306 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.307 \\  \hline

He didn't say he wasn't going to stand up for anything, he simply said he will continue to judge people as individuals and look at the situation rather than on group identification society so often uses today. I'm not sure what you expect him to do. Just because he's male does not make him inherently sexist nor does it make it his job to fix \textbf{sexism} within the industry. If he encountered \textbf{sexism} of course hopefully he would speak out but the idea that he needs to take a step back from his own career for women is wrong in my opinion. He does not represent all men and should be judged not by his \textbf{gender} but by his actions and words.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/134 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.239 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Agree with all those super impressed with Salma.  She had great points and she expressed them passionately.  Matthias seemed to have thought a lot less about these issues.  His comments around 19:00 about seeing the human being before identities such as black/white/Asian/Latino or male/female, etc. is tone-deaf.  Criticizing identity politics is something people in positions of privilege often do.  It's easy to be white and male and say "I just see people, not \textbf{race}, \textbf{gender} etc."  Try living with \textbf{racism}, \textbf{sexism}, transphobia etc on a daily basis.  You don't get a choice about "just being human".  Many people put you in a box; THAT is your reality.  As a minority you have to navigate those waters.  For minorities, identity politics is the path to pursue justice and equality.  In short, minorities don't have the privilege to ignore identity politics.  Matthias should question his own privilege and the space he is afforded that others are not to "see people as humans first."  Just my humble opinion, though I think he means well.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender, Race, Racism, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}4/171 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.339 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I would be stressed out too, now a days sometimes it's even worst have to talk about this issue in front of the world, cause every word you say can be misunderstanded if you don't really pay attenction on it. And this issue is even a lot complicated to speak about, it takes so much time, so many things to say, and before say something you have to think about what you want to say under any possible perspective and make sure it will not be misunderstanded, cause if not you will be eat alive.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I saw Far From the Maddening Crowds and was so impressed.Â  I also applaud Schoenaerts comments about \textbf{sexism} which is rampant everywhere but I wonder if he is the best candidate for this panel.Â You see,Â IÂ also saw Schoenaerts interview for NY Magazine where he states that Mike Tyson was his "childhood hero".Â  Mike Tyson,Â a convicted rapist and alleged wife abuser.Â  I ask myself what can be more sexist thanÂ rape and abuse and why glorify a man who has been convicted of it?Â  Never mind the poor sportsmanship of biting offÂ Hollyfield's ear.Â  Watching Schoenaerts for me was like watchingÂ aÂ person speakingÂ from bothÂ sidesÂ of hisÂ mouth.Â  IÂ am not on a crusade againstÂ Mike Tyson personally.Â  There are too many \textbf{sexual} predators out there toÂ be limited to one.Â  My heros are the women and men (although there are far fewer of them) who against incredible pressure stand up to their abusers to speak out and the people who stand with them.Â  I know I will probably receive a lot of criticism for this post; probably called a fem-Nazi and other such terms that will not bother me.Â  Actually though, I am a 60 year \textbf{old} \textbf{woman} who has been married for 30 years with a wonderful son.Â  There are a lot of men in my life who I love and have loved. Â My 17 year \textbf{old} son boxes too but would never hold Mike Tyson upÂ as aÂ hero.Â  He knows that the \textbf{sexual} abuse I experienced at the \textbf{age} of 7 from the hands ofÂ a deacon of the Baptist Church hasÂ affected myÂ Â whole life.Â  This predator later went on the sexually abuse an \textbf{old} women and two more girls Â (that I know of) and never brought to justice.Â  One of the greatest regrets of my life was that I was too traumatized and youngÂ at the time to speak out.Â  I speak out now and ask that Schoenaerts grow up from his "childhood heros" and not tout convicted rapists as heroes.Â  It is offensive and, besides, there are many truerÂ heros of boxing...

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small +Corry Helmond I think its incredibly unfair to bet annoyed of an accent. THis feeling is simply stemming from the fact that most likely you are not used to that accent at all and so are uncomfortable with it, while the same is untrue of American accents. As an \textbf{Indian}, I find American accents incredibly annoying simply because I'm not used to them. That does not mean its fair to say that they must have my accent in my country or I must get their accent in their country. USA accents are seen as less annoying only because of the fact that Hollywood is huge all over the world, and people can get used to American accents by watching films. But \textbf{nobody} except one of that same \textbf{nationality} watch films of their own country. I don't think there's anything known as a normal accent. Suggesting that people better get used to talking "American" in America only creates one bland accent for all instead of the great cultural tapestry of various accents. Diversity is best promoted by identifying these accents and keeping them. They are a part of that country's culture. Kudos to Salma for holding onto her accent. If she wants to keep it, its fine. If people want to change their accent, that's cool too. Just don't suggest that all must try to have one accent.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Indian, Nationality, Nobody & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Native-American, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/227 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.322 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Just be honest. Â Hollywood is the way it is because it's run by a small group. Â It's not just male. It's white males. Â And it's not just white males, it's Jewish white males. Â When you are dealing with such a small sliver of the population you're going to rfind homogeneity. Â  And THAT is truly why Hollywood makes the films it does, because they see the world through their own prism of invariability, and they project that invariability onto audiences everywhere. Â It's not that they are evil. Â Those in Hollywood just aren't sophisticated thinkers. Â They think they are breaking the mold with \textbf{black} jokes and Al Jolsen-esque style of perpetuating stereotypes in order to elevate their own culture closer to the traditional ideal.

Salma knows what the producers in Hollywood want from her and she freely gives it to them because it brings her money - simple as that. That's why I call her a hypocrite, she's living her life by double standards. Then you have women like Meryl Streep or Diane Keaton who are incredibly talented and that's why they still keep getting roles despite their high \textbf{age}. And good roles for aged women in Hollywood are rare because this industry has been running ever since by a bunch of powerful guys with big influence that are thinking with their penis.

You're also ignoring the fact that there are MANY MORE actresses who have much more nude scenes than her.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@isabelle eden wow you are really a \textbf{dumb} celebrity worshipper. The fact that I was pointing out in my comments is that in every major movie she has made, the producers in Hollywood requested her to show off her skin to gain more money out of it. And she didn't say no when they asked her about it - because money... And then in this video here this stupid and hypocrite \textbf{woman} is criticizing Hollywood and how they portray women? But you are too \textbf{blind} to see the hypocrisy here hm? And how \textbf{dumb} can one person be to not understand how the film business is working? Shaking my head, you look to me like some of these brainless tools in Jersey Shore or something like that... did you ever read Kant, Plato, Socrates, Nietzsche or anything like that?

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Vernostonus Seriously, \textbf{woman} can't be criticized these days, and if you do, even if you make good points, you get labeled a sexist...no one is 100 right about anything but everyone defending women in everything can't listen to ANYTHING they don't like even if it makes a lot of sense....women and their white nights want \textbf{nothing} but praise for women. They cry "EQUALITY FOR ALL!!!" while shaming men and critiquing their every move that isn't 100 ALL for women.....Salma does however make a good point about how more movies with female leads will be made if hollywood sees that there is a monetary gain to it....It's true that women are objectified in Hollywood more so than men, but it does irk me when actresses who are known to let themselves be 'objectified' then complain about it after making millions and getting a career out of it...a more appropriate speaker on the topic would be Meryl Streep\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nothing, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/157 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.274 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Ere Lent yeah, exactly. I agree with you. Feminazis are stupid hypocrites. I am for feminism and equality but let's be honest here: The women in Hollywood like Salma are getting paid to objectify themselves as a \textbf{sexual} object. That's what the horny guys want to see from her. By defending her you look like a \textbf{dumb} and \textbf{blind} tool. Meryl Streep is a million times more talented than Salma. She doesn't need to get naked in every movie she makes... this \textbf{woman} has class! I would rather listen to her speaking about this topic than to a well known slut in the industry, only famous for taking off the clothes by any given chance. Just look how she dresses on \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} carpet events... she needs \textbf{sex} to sell and that's cheap and pathetic. I want more women using their brain instead of their body. That's what this world needs, brilliant scientists like Marie Curie for example.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Dear Salma Hayek, I listened to all of your remarks and your observations are surely true and relevant but let's remember the many actresses who made a name on their own no matter how briljant their male counterparts were, they are remembered and not just as a sex-symbol. I'll start the list in the '50: Anna Magnani, Sophia Loren, Gina Lolobridgida,Claudia Cardinale, Giulietta Massini ...( the Italian ones)...Simonne Signoret, Jeanne Moreau, Brigitte Bardot, Danielle Darieux, Catherine Deneuve, Juliette Binoche ...(French)...Romy Schneider...and many others that NO male actor ever had any problem to act with. If I would list the American or British actresses the list would be very large. I think that a lot of male actors - in an eventual leading role or even second role- just always like to work with actresses that meet-up with their notion of what their role in a film asks for. It is not about who they want to kiss or not. If the talent is there they'll jump. Of course I am aware that a lot of talent remains underestimated...that is the same traject for male and female actresses. A real Light can never be kept under the carpet. The female directors are only a few, I agree. But women are not inclined as much as men to go all the way through the difficulties that every moviemaker encounters when presenting their project to (eventual) producers. There are women willing to go all the way. You are one of them. There are briljant female script writers...but are you aware of the amount of briljant male writers who are dismissed just the same way? Male directors that are sent home just the same way female directors are sent home? And yes Matthias Schoenaerts, as a person with \textbf{common} sense and sensitivity, is not making a difference between men or women when reading a script, not making any difference between men and women when the director is pointed out, not making any question about who is gonna be his female costar, because IT IS ALL ABOUT: WHAT IS THE STORY WE wanna tell, HOW WE GONNA tell that story, WILL WE BE ABLE to tell that story HOW IT NEEDS TO BE TOLD.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Common & \cellcolor{green!5}Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}1/369 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.271 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Silent Mama I completely agree with you, not as many women are interested in the rigorous work that is FILMMAKING, just as there are less than 5 of women working as garbage collectors. Different professions attract different people, and men face the same problems that women face when trying to become a filmmaker. While there is some discrimination against women in film, it doesn't mean that we should forcefully give women more jobs in filmmaking just for the sake of diversity, because that wouldn't be fair to the countless more men who may be more qualified for the job. I think the job of director, producer, writer, etc. should go to the person who can do the job the best, regardless of whether it's a \textbf{woman} or a man. Since more men are interested in fimmaking in general, it makes sense that in turn, more men are working as filmmakers. The low number of women may in part be because of \textbf{sexism}, but I don't think it's as big of a setback as people claim it to be; there are simply less women interested in the profession.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Sexism, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/187 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.07 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I agree with both of you, we should stop talking about numbers and genders, we should go over it as Matthias does, sensivity is the key, give the job to the people are the best in doing it, and don-t care if they are more man then women or the opposite. The success will come when we will look at each other recognizing our talents and in what we are the best, not the \textbf{gender}. Really embrace diversity, and not because it's a trend.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/84 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.19 \\  \hline

Salma has taken her clothes off,true but most of that was done when she was young and not as cultivated as she is now.
