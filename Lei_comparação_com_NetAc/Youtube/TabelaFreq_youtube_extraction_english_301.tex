\hline\cellcolor{green!27}\small Umzantsi need the a Spiritual, Intellectual, Moral and Material Revolution more urgently than the rest of the Alkebulan continent because of the WORSE ALIENATION in their actually dramatic conditions (despite the systemic illusions and delusions that entrap them simply more than the rest of the mentally, intellectually, materially and spiritually colonized Alkebulan people). Of All the Alkebulans they are the the most alienated and ones who know less who they are, what is expected from them from our noble Ancestors since Âtum, Sét, Idrîs Ahnûh 'Jëhûti', Nûh, where they are from where they are going. Understanding the Quadratics of Real Development is understanding the problem on Umzantsi (so-called 'South Africa') as an abnormal Peripheral Colony in Delusions of Power inside a much larger \textbf{alien} system that dispossessed them of the most important elements of Alkebulan Wun'iyah (Civilization of Being) and even Hëpër'iyah (Culttures of Becoming) while giving them the illusion of being priviledged 'political' superheros and beggars everywhere else. Nigeria is suffering a somehow similar situation with the Petrodollar Club and the illusions of 'power' while commuting basic crimes that are absolutely contrary and horrific with regard to the Noble Wun'iyah and Hëpër'iyah of instructed  by the Nobles among our Ancestors, even though in an other format of delusion and alienation. The illusions created by Empty 'Political' 'Power' and the brainwashing and Systemic Grooming of  'Material Prosperity' have created an ALIENATED crowd of ignorants and zombies. 'The-White-Financial-and-'Spiritual'-Jesus' deep brainwashing is certainly not helping them either. Notice that the more this Alienation, Real Economic, Political and Spiritual Dis-possession Factor is présent in an colonized or neocolonized Alkebulan population the likelier these types of events to happen.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Alien & \cellcolor{green!27}Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/275 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.364 \\  \hline

Because I have called, and ye have refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man hath regarded;  But ye have set at nought all my counsel, And would none of my reproof:  I also will laugh in the day of your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;  When your fear cometh as a storm, And your calamity cometh on as a whirlwind; When distress and anguish come upon you.  Then will they call upon me, but I will not answer; They will seek me diligently, but they shall not find me:  For that they hated knowledge, And did not choose the fear of Jehovah,  They would none of my counsel, They despised all my reproof.  Therefore shall they eat of the \textbf{fruit} of their own way, And be filled with their own devices.  For the backsliding of the simple shall slay them, And the careless ease of fools shall destroy them.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small A lot, if not most, Foreign Nationals only work in their own solid clusters, and not in conjunction with South Africans and have a condescending attitude towards South Africans, different people from different countries possess different skills and so this requires cooperation rather than national identity capitalisation. They circulate money among themselves and really only hire their cousins whom they have shipped in illegally unless desperate. This is working to destabilise social order and peace and the economy. The government must crack down on illegal immigration before it leads to chaos and violence in the near future! There must be real consequences for it otherwise it will never stop! people will keep flocking and we will keep integrating and integrating without discretion, that can only be foolishness! we don't even have asylum camps, we just integrate and pour immigrants into our society without clear objectives and provisions for them, Our government are slack, lazy and reactionary. they do not want to take action and authority for fear of being labelled as Xenophobic! at the cost of South Africans and their generations who should have South Africa as an inheritance, but at this pace it will be in the hands of foreign nationals and they will look back and say we were the ones who were foolish enough to allow it. We love our \textbf{African} brothers and sisters and the whole diaspora but this bullying by illegal immigrants and sympathetic foreign nationals using emotional blackmail is not whats going to build and secure this country and its future! Soon enough South Africans will struggle to identify what is to call their own country. That is the basis of \textbf{xenophobia} and it is a legitimate concern! (not that attacking is justified). Hundreds of thousands of foreign nationals are \textbf{doctors} and \textbf{engineers} and nurses and teachers and lecturers in South Africa.
