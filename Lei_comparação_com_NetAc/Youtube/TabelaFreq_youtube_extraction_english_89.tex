  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I bet that it's a joke and those guys filming are in on it, she looks directly at them at 19 seconds in.

But I imagine if she's dating a Tesla driver that she's seen him charge that car before (I have an EV and I charge often).  It could be staged.  Her eyebrows are \textbf{black}.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The only explanation for this that makes sense to me is that she's borrowing a friend's car, and she never really paid any attention to any news articles about Tesla, and so knows \textbf{nothing} about it whatsoever, being a person aggressively uninterested in technology and automobiles.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Omg...as a \textbf{woman}, I can tell that is a man.  First, the actor is very tall.  Most women that height are either naturally slim, or very curvy (with wide hips).  They are also rare.The actor has slender hips relative to the rest of his body.The calves are thick and muscular.The actor's gait and posture are very masculine.  \textbf{Woman} have different anatomy and skeletal structure than men, so the way the "\textbf{woman}" was walking and standing would be very unnatural for a \textbf{woman}.The physique of the actor is stocky and thick, but not in a curvy way.  This is partly hidden with the loose bulky jacket.  That's probably the reason the guy selected the jacket.Even if you don't believe me with any of that...the hair!!I do not know a single \textbf{woman} beyond the \textbf{age} of 2 who would even contemplate styling her hair like that.And I don't know a single \textbf{woman} who would ever dare leave the house with her hair a tangled mess like that.

Also  before getting in car to drive off WHY did she unlock the central locking??.   Its all staged.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small This is staged because:- How did she know how to open the charge port. There's no button, its in a submenu and you have to know where to look. It doesn't say "fuel door"- How did she know she needed gas? The car has no fuel gauge or a low fuel light, the only thing is a battery indicator that looks like the one on your phone. The car tells you to "charge" it when it gets low, not to "fuel" it and it will suggest directions to a supercharger, not a gas station.- She never completed all the steps to actually pump gas. She didn't put her \textbf{zip} or pin (required in California) and she never selected the fuel grade. Sure, you can select all that after you put the nozzle in but who swipes their card and then doesn't follow the prompts right away if you're serious about getting gas.- The car immediately locks itself after she shuts the driver's door, indicating that the key had to be far enough away (not with her and not in the car) for it to trigger auto-lock. Most likely the key is with the guys in the Prius (who are filming and giggling). This is also evident in the fact that the trunk opens again right after she closes it. The car wouldn't do that, they pushed the button for extra comedic effect.- Why would all this happened while she's conveniently dressed in the most stereotypical way of a "\textbf{dumb} rich blond ... \textbf{woman}" and someone is filming it perfectly in landscape format? Please...This video has been picked up by news outlets across the world. Just goes to show that 1. there is very little critical thinking going on and 2. we must not have better things to talk about.
