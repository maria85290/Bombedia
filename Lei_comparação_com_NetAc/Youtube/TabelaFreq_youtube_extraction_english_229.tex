  \cellcolor{green!5}\small What's going on ?! Some of the people talking here don't look like any particular \textbf{race}, they can be classed as white or \textbf{Indian} or Mexican of Middle Eastern or southeast Asian , I'm very confused with the fact that some \textbf{black} Australian Aboriginal people have silky blonde hair  ! I guess it makes perfect sense to have a fair hair in a sunny place as it would reflect the sun's harsh rays So why is it that the \textbf{black} people of the \textbf{African} continent don't have this genetically beneficial blond hair ?! And the fact that the Australian Aboriginal people can look so much like other races is something that is not being investigated, I think they have the most amazing genes on the planet , my personal opinion is that the  Australian Aboriginal people are probably the progenitors of all other races on earth , and I think one day this idea of mine will be established as a possibility?!

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small A lot of them are mixed with white people. They is only one that might be mostly Aboriginal. So if you are a descendant of whites, they will offer more support to you, which free you from some of the stereotypes.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small So many people commenting that these people are: 'not really Aboriginal' or: 'not dark enough' or: 'mixed not Aboriginal' or: 'only a bit Aboriginal'. Would you tell an African-American person (for example) that they aren't allowed an opinion on being \textbf{black} because they're not dark-skinned enough? Would you tell them they don't qualify as \textbf{black} because they're mixed? Horrible parade of hatred in these comments, under the guise of being woke. Who are you to argue with anyone's factual genetic heritage? Who made you the god of what's 'Aboriginal enough'? Smacks too much of the 'one-drop rule' kind of thinking to me. Yes, all the people in this video happen to be light-skinned, did it ever occur to you that perhaps BuzzFeedYellow chose them specifically because they don't look like the stereotype of Aboriginal people that the video was made in order to debunk? It certainly got all of your attention and got you discussing the issue.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small These people are Australians with aboriginal ancestors...that can legally "identify" as Aboriginal.Regardless of being prominently of European decent in alot of cases.Fact of the matter is none of them are Aboriginal without being mixed \textbf{ethnicity}. They can legally identify as aboriginal because their great+ grand parent may or may not have been part native.The last Tasmanian aboriginal died in the 1800s. There are possibly only 30,000 direct descendants left, if that. The discrepancy between this and the 600,000+ listed in the statistics are those that identify as one.Middle Eastern and Europeans dominantly contributed to the mixing of natives over the 1700-1800s.They were almost driven to extinction with only an estimated 60,000 left.Personally I just see Australian's of aboriginal decent.Just as I'm not an indigenous German or indigenous Englishman. I'm Australian with great grandparents that originated from those 2 countries.How are modern day Australians with aboriginal ancestors any different?But then I say the same for anyone born here with forign parents.

Another thing I want to add, Indigenous Australians are generally \textbf{BLACK} because we have dark skin too in our DNA, like many others across the world. Some indigenous people are light skinned because they could be from urban places like Sydney, Melbourne and Perth etc. whereas darker skinned people and others with Indigenous features would come from the rural regions.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small What people don't understand is that 'Aboriginal' isn't about how you look and what skin colour you are. People who identify themselves as aboriginal can range from dark-skinned, broad-nosed to blonde haired and blue- eyed people. Aboriginality isn't defined by skin colour but by their family/ancestors. Aboriginality runs through your blood, through your ancestors, it's about your culture and heritage. Aboriginality isn't something u can chose. These guys may be light skinned and have a little bit of white in them but that doesn't mean they're not aboriginal. They maybe be even 2 white and 98 aboriginal, but they happen to have light skin because of that 2. It's seems as though people have an image in their minds of what an aboriginal looks like, which is often \textbf{black} with dark curly hair.

Every people group in human history has its fair share of stupid people/customs, some more recently than others. I just didn't know that stereotypes like this existed at all for this particular group. Keep in mind, growing up in the Midwest, most of my knowledge of Aboriginals comes from Crocodile Dundee, (you know, dancing around a fire and playing didgeridoos), and an \textbf{old} Western movie I don't even remember the name of, though I do remember the Aboriginals being portrayed as the good guys/victims.I know that just like anyone, some Aboriginals were good, and some were bad, and these perceptions are mostly a result of the bad ones.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Uepohatu Te Kira  No, I don't believe in vengeance. I don't believe in it because it only leads to more and more bloodshed through creating cycles of violence. This is what the Aboriginals ultimately caused when they started killing the first Europeans. For every European killed, the Europeans then killed many more Aboriginals as reprisals only to have the Aboriginals kill more Europeans as part of their reprisals. The Aboriginals really only have themselves to blame for starting the killings, and the Europeans were the ones who finally ended them. "AND! oooOoh, did you realise that maybe, just maybe the Aboriginals did own Australia?"They may have thought they did, by virtue of having no competitors for ownership for thousands of years. That doesn't mean they automatically get to actually own it for all time when someone else shows up who has the ability to enforce what they think of as being their own ownership. The aboriginals were just lucky to of had no one else around who wanted ownership for as long as they did. In the end they were just keeping the seat warm. Who owns Australia now can also have their ownership challenged at any time, it's just today, with geopolitics as it is, trying to change ownership now would likely result in a world war. If they won the war, though, Australia would naturally be theirs as they would have eliminated their competition. If you think about it, some \textbf{alien} \textbf{race} could probably claim the entire planet as their own if they existed and wanted to. They may even own it now and we don't even know it.

Many live in poor communities funded mostly by the government (Australian tax payers) which the people generally don't maintain to a decent standard then the government has to pay to repair/replace whatever is wrong. Per capita aboriginals get \$11,500 per person from the government, compared to \$3000 to than any other Australian. Now this isn't one main reason for this there are many but it mainly comes down to poor mindsets from the adult aboriginals so they don't send there kids to school which is never good. Another is poor design plans by the government after the stolen generation. It will take many years for there to be no 'gap' between Aboriginals and non-aboriginals.

This device is put into the vagina and then removed, pulling away a large part of the womb. The rest of the womb is then cut horizontally and vertically with a stone knife. When this wound is healed, the girl is then circumcised and made to have intercourse with many young men. The mix of blood and semen is collected and given to frail tribesmen as a fortifying elixir.'Do you need more? How about the literal \textbf{witch} hunts in Papua New \textbf{Guinea}?

They did a lot of other horrible things like stealing their children to make them learn in instatutions  to teach them how to be more "white".

However at the same time, the Aboriginals in the second half of the 1900's were getting their children forcibly taken from them and raised in orphanages where they were taught to feel shame for what they were, and were subject to constant physical, psychological, and \textbf{sexual} abuse. Not only in orphanages or foster homes, but also in the aboriginal communities, women and children to this day are at constant risk of victimization for physical and \textbf{sexual} abuse by both aboriginal and white men, both within their family and outside their family. People ignore the issue and those accused can get out of being charged by simply not showing up to court. If people try to get help within the community they are often ignored, ridiculed, or even punished, even by their own family. Children are often forced or coerced into addiction to substances such as \textbf{alcohol} and petrol sniffing to facilitate the perpetration of \textbf{sexual} abuse.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Aboriginal is a term for indigenous people (as in a people native to a certain land), but it also applies to the population of people living specifically in Australia prior to white settlement. Throughout Australian history, Aboriginals have been discriminated against, given fewer rights, and many of those with lighter skin were taken away from their families and forced to become maids and servants to rich white families.  Even now, Aboriginals tend to be poorer and much more disadvantaged that many other \textbf{ethnic} groups in Australia due to continuing \textbf{racism} and and a legacy of poverty. However, their culture is extremely rich and colorful, with some of the most beautiful nature artwork of any culture in the world.

Noone is saying that those \textbf{ethnic} Jews do not have customs, food, languages or music. What I am saying is that being Jewish is in itself not an \textbf{ethnicity}.

A-grade meant you were light enough in skin colour and your features 'European' enough to pass as a white child (then give to families who never know of your aboriginal heritage.) B-grade was when you could still be spotted for being Aboriginal if you knew what to look for, but was passable enough to be mistaken for white.
