  \cellcolor{green!27}\small India is the most ancient society and it practices and customs have been varied across different regions and has evolved to changing societal needs. That is why they have survived and are thriving till today. They don't blindly follow one book and follow it as a death cult.They have the Shrutis  ( the ultimate human values or dharma like  honesty, truthfulness, respect etc ) and Smritis that are customs and practices that could be adapted, changed as the society changes. It is the most liberating philosophy. Not to be stuck in a rut called Book.These communities are in a very negligible number and their practices are slowly changing BUT we in the west have to nit pick and show only that when we are infested with th so many evils in our own society.On a lighter note , I found the \textbf{woman} much more happier than many around me.
