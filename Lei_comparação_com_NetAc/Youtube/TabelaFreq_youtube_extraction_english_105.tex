  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Life Noggin: there his another reason why it his a bad idea to do that, that you did not mention, specificly for that purpose. Even if you \textbf{old} person your bone naturally produce the new blood and remove the \textbf{old} one. getting a blood donation to speed that process up, and if you do it to often this will prevent your bone from producing new blood since your bone will percieve as the new source always come from outside, then if something happen that the doctor run out of blood donation, and your schecdule to receive some when they are out, and it take month for the new one to come, but the \textbf{old} person bone still excpect to receive the new blood from outside, and will never produce its own blood untill it his too late and that \textbf{old} person as die from having \textbf{old} blood for too long.  That does not mean you should never get a blood transfusion,  Blood transfution are for after an accident when you lose to much blood, that the bones can produce it fast enought before the person die from lack of oxygen to the brain, and heart, they are other medical reason as well, but you never stay constitly on it because it his just a one time thing. Unlike the young blood make \textbf{old} people better reason.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}6/226 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.655 \\  \hline
