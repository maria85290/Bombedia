The barber shop reaction was much better but again that coulda been to do with not wanting to harm the business, but the best comments came from the customers there anyway so yeah I'd say much better reaction. I think for the most part people were probably more confused that someone was voicing prejudices out loud in a place where it's normally just joked or spoken about casually between friends than offended and also both geezers were kicking off it could've been totally unrelated to \textbf{race} and people would've got up and split it up the same. quite funny way to end it though\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Race, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/221 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.357 \\  \hline

Like those that try to enact sharia law in christian nations outside of the nations laws and the elites that try to allow it against the wishes of their own people. Bloodshed is coming. And these ARROGANT elites know it and do not care and in fact actively work to encite a violent clash among the different peoples. They are traitors and will eventually, although they think themselves insulated from reproach, will pay the ultimate price for all eternity and suffer the ultimate punishment for all time .....EXTINCTION. The very thing they tried to bring upon so many others. And their irradication will be celebrated by all mankind for as long as humanity exists. A fitting punishment for such an evil dark despicable group among the human \textbf{race}. But they are and will be the architects of their own demise for all eternity. And ANYONE that even remotely attempts to immitate their attitides beliefs or actions will immediately be put to death and irradicated and condemned with those that attempted such things in the past. This is what is  meant in the bible by the meek inhereting the earth. When the people FINALLY take direct control over their lives their government their economy and their own destiny. Rather than what we have now with an arrogant group of elites that think they "know better" than the peasants. But what the peasants havent learned is the same thing the arrogant elites havent learned or know and fear.....THEY DONT KNOW BETTER. As history proves time and time and time again. And until the peasants learn this truth they are doomed to be the pawns of those that deem themselves to "know better" than everyone else and shape the world to reflect this attitude and perspective which is always destructive.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Blind, Race, Racism & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}10/740 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.351 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small You no the thing to me about \textbf{black} people and the reparations and the mind set to have color shame. I grew up in a \textbf{black} neighborhood and around them. My take on the whole thing is blacks have been punishing whites in america for nearly a century. They live on the system, create violence, and just make America worse. The United States bringing blacks over in slavery was the worst thing ever. Now we have violence, unemployment, and have to listen to ignorance. I am not speaking about \textbf{racism} I'm speaking facts. Look at the Africa nations where the country is ran by blacks they kill each other in genocides, and there country is a fourth world country. You look at prodominetly \textbf{black} neighborhoods in America and you kill violence \textbf{black} on \textbf{black} violence poverty and a horrible community. Anytime there is a white community the violence is next to none, the education  level is high and the property values are high. Then \textbf{black} people move into the neighborhood and the price of real estate plummet. Its no a coincidence. Its sad \textbf{black} people one day need to stop  think every \textbf{race} white,Latino,Asian,       and so on want to avoid living in a \textbf{black} neighborhood they continue to move away from the city and branch out into white communities. The schools are another example white schools education level very high,violence very low,and a group togetherness very high. \textbf{Black} schools education low,violence high, and violence against one another very high. I personally don't no why its like this but I would love to see a change one way or another. And for the \textbf{black} activists spewing stuff saying they are still owed for there great great great grandparents. Do some research you will find slaves owners were obviously deep south and there were less than 00.1percent of the south. Many white families come from immigrants who at the time of slavery were not in this country. Me for example both grandparents came from Germany so I do not have any family that were in the United States during slavery. And that's goes for the majority of Americans. You also have northern people who died in the civil war to help free the slaves. But the only thing \textbf{black} people say is they want reperations. I have one thing the United States can offer. If a \textbf{black} person traces there family tree and there family were slaves they should be offered a, plane ticket to Africa and the US can work out where they would get instant citizenship . they would get a plane ticket,citizenship, and a small amount of money as a start up.once that person leaves there citizenship to the United States becomes null in void.

Every \textbf{race} has suffered slavery. 3rd class people in the colonies and early US were slaves including white people. This consisted of the Irish, Dutch, Germans, Greeks, Italians, ect. The only difference is, we later called them indentured servants because the government feeds off of civil unrest. It's like a smoke grenade to hide what they want to do next.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Nikita You know what? You are totally entitled to your opinion. But I find just as much \textbf{racism} in other ethnicities as I do whites. IT'S A HATE PROBLEM, NOT A COLOR PROBLEM. People hate that which they fear, they fear that which they don't understand, and they don't understand that which is different from them. And blacks, Asians, Koreans, Saudi Arabians, Indians, Pakistani, Africans, Europeans, Italians, Southern Americans, Eskimos, EVERYBODY - is guilty of this. Do NOT go trying to point blame. Remember that when you do, just how many fingers are pointed back at you. You don't want to SOLVE the problem, you are PROPAGATING it. YOU behave with a divisive mindset, an "us" vs. "them" mindset, and you'll have this division in people. I personally can't stand people being \textbf{racist} and being unable to see past color - ALL color. "Multiculturalism" is a politically correct term for people who are too afraid to call the problem what it is: HATE. FEAR. DIVISION. Don't even GO there.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small It is truly shameful so many people tag so called \textbf{racism} to individual bias and pronounce universal discrimination. It is through scientific evidence and studies such claims are generally due to insecurities of the individual or group claiming such inequalities. Today's technology has no room for \textbf{racism} nor claims of the same. It is a waste of resources to entertain alleged entitlements. Grow up, get a job, and live in the present. "He who dwells in the past lives an eternal unbliss." Quoted by me 33 years ago as a high school student and from a bi-racial family in a multi-racial environment. Claims of \textbf{racism} is a crutch used by those who fail in the process of contributing to society and choose to live off of society. They choose to wear a cloak of deception and lies tailored by ancestral antiquity they just can't let go of.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Y0utubeIsFuckingHomo There is a huge difference between ''true  stereotypes'' and ''\textbf{racist} stereotypes''.

On the other hand, I can understand where the \textbf{racist} one comes from, looking at our not so far away history. The thing is, that you can't can't really put sterotypes on whites, like you put them and Afro-Americans or Mexicans... I mean a Afro-American from Washington, and a AA from Los Angeles or Texas is pretty much the same thing, they are similar... while when it comes too white peoples Americans and Europeans are quite different from each other... And in Europe, there is variety too. So the steretypes unsually need to have a direct target: the way in which the American and Frech see the world is different, even trough they are both white. A good white sterotype? Well, regarding White Americans: Shitty Tourist's. While there are decent american tourists, there are some relly bad ones that made americans notorious in Europe. Another one can be regarding the rampant obesity. Other example: Germans - hard working; obviously there are lazy peoples in Germany too, but is comonly accepted, that Germans are extremly hard working peoples... is true, but is a stereotype. On the other hand we have Greeks, which are well know as: extremly lazy peoples. Again, is a stereotype, and there are hard working Greeks, but is also true that many of them are extremly lazy and ignorant, that why they are in their actual situation.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/298 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.671 \\  \hline

Because they seemed Aryans beautiful. So Mongolians have hunt Aryans for making their wives after meeting Aryans for thousands years.This pattern had been repeating since Yin dynasty of China in ancient history books. I read the same pattern contents repeatedly so boared many times. Because this pattern appeared many times in east history.Scythians had been the strongest fighters in the west. But they became weak people and nations in the east which had dedicated women and gold, silver to Mongolians after losing the many wars with Mongolia and China. Northern east asians called Scythians as Sogdians and had been often taken their women and havings.After them Persian then Horasm then Aryan islam nations had dedicated instead of Scythians to Northern east asian nomads.Especially when Russia was reigned under Mongolia for hundreds. Including TaTar, many Mongol tribes have changed into European's appearance different from the ancient historic writings of Greek and Rome, China. They originally were rounded faces and have very low and wide noses and very sharp and small eyes, short limbs according to Rome and China writings. You can confirm above history from Russia history.If you see the stone cave murals and Orhon stone writings bar in the middle east which Turkeys are worshiping, You will know that Turkeys originally were not Europeans blooded but pure Asians. They are the result of blood mixing above.As a result, even Hittler of German worshiped Northern east asian nomad knights.Do not boast your bodies.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I'd say this is all fairly predictable. These days, unless the establishment is owned and populated by the NF, any random group of white people would react as they did in the pub. The simple truth is that there are some white people who have an issue with skin colour, and the same goes for some \textbf{black} people.Years ago, we moved into an area of east London. I was warned by an \textbf{elderly} white resident that, for whites, it wasn't safe to go outside in the evening. The first evening I went to the corner shop a gang of \textbf{black} guys followed us in and threatened us for being in their area. On another occasion, I was beaten almost to death by a mixed asian-\textbf{black} gang for being white in the wrong place. Some time ago, a \textbf{black} guy actually suggested I deserved it because they must have sensed my inherent \textbf{racism}! No, I was jumped as I quietly made my way home from work. They didn't know anything about me, other than I was white. "\textbf{Racism}" cuts both ways. I had several more enlightened \textbf{black} friends when I lived there but there are still some blacks and some whites stupid enough to focus on skin colour.The word "\textbf{racist}" is often misused though. These days, it is persistently used against people who dare question our insane immigration policy and the consequent burden on UK services.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Elderly, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}8/237 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.376 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small +joey clay It's about viewing \textbf{racism} as an institution instead of an action. What you described is racial discrimination. Any time a person treats someone badly or unfairly solely because of skin color, that is racial discrimination. "\textbf{Racism}" is the encompassment of the idea of all these discriminative acts causing a group with significantly less power or control, oppression. Anybody, anywhere can be racially discriminative to anyone. But in order to say a person is encompassing "\textbf{racism}" or being "\textbf{racist}", they would have to have the ability to oppress someone with their actions and to essentially add to the overall problem/growing problem of oppression against the group that person falls under.In short, calling a shop owner a "\textbf{racist}" for not allowing Asians in his shop means you are saying that shop owner is fueling the pool of oppression against Asains that already exists. However, if for example an Asian shop owner living in America doesn't allow whites in his shop, that act may be racially discriminative but it isn't "\textbf{racist}" because that man will never have the ability to add to an oppression pool against whites in America. Because white people in America have privilege. All presidents until recent have been white, whites are still the most featured in TV ads, and there hasn't even been racial equality in the country for more even 60 years yet. White people still hold privilege in the country so there is no pool of oppression for them. And that's why society doesn't treat white discrimination as an "active problem" in America. There are thousands of cultural studies courses that will teach you the same thing.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Here is smthng to ponder: Frankly, skin color is not significant, skin color gives no meaning at all to a person's character. What gives a person meaning is his belief, culture, upbringing and his society.A human is a tool that things can be downloaded into, like a sponge. For instance you have the \textbf{Black} American and the Africans who have totally different cultures, \textbf{black} americans listen to rap and have that thug mentality, while Africans have a culture that is totally different with no thug metality, no rap music. You have white Amercans, who believe that anything with skin color is inferior, and they oppress anyone with skin color. This is their belief, a while ago they believed that slavery was right and later segregation was the trend and all that belief changed overtime, and you have white people now believing in human rights, that all men are created equal with a few still adhering to the past believe that nullifies the present belief. You have the justice system condoning terrorism of \textbf{black} men, shooting unarmed \textbf{black} men who pose no threat who may still be uprehended in another way. These are what form a person, it could be wrong belief, but eventually the whole society adopts this belief and it becomes the norm. But if you look under the skin of any human, there is no difference. Thus the skin does not have a value in making a persons nature, what has value is what goes into your brain and heart. The Bible said, guard your heart with all diligence for from it flows the very life.But back to the meaning of this writing, if God created all human in his own image, and gave them different skin color, then skin color is not the value of being human. We know that God became human to redeem us from sin, he became Jesus Christ.So why did he not choose to become white, or \textbf{black} because there is no importance in skin color. It is not about skin color people. Beneath our shell is a spirit, meaning the real you is a colorless being, a spirit. It is this world that made everything become confusing.Again it is not skin color that determins your final resting place heaven or hell, but it all boils down to your belief and behavior. The Bible said that he had feet like bronze, yet while we know that God is a spirit, and he became Jesus, and even when the Holy Spirit showed up in the form of a Dove, when Jesus was being baptized. Then you can deduce that it is not about appearance that God cares about, since his Spirit can take a form of a Dove, then that means that a body is just a place where the spirit lives, it is the car or vehicle we get by.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!27}5/481 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.04 \\  \hline

I forgot  another delicious part aNd because of this you brits got your first 21 century nick name wells there's two actually. but getting to the point Because of britians failure economically they had to bend over to the rich they had to cater over to the millionaires and billionaires and also depend on them to survive. and Guess WHAT!! it actually worked for a while .  But the down side was now they were the bitch of not just america now but the wealthy .

The War was first fought by the Union in order to preserve the alliance of states and turn them into a single \textbf{nation}. Then, when the South was doing too well, Lincoln proclaimed the slaves free. The purpose of this was twofold: extra soldiers, which the Union sorely needed; and the moral high ground, which the Union needed more than anything else.Meanwhile, the Confederacy (and even the blacks of the Confederacy who volunteered against the Union) maintained the same position: Freedom. Which means that the "bloodiest war in American history" was a farce, and that, given the social clime of the times, slavery would have been abolished without bloodshed as it was everywhere else in a matter of a decade.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nation & \cellcolor{green!27}Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/136 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.735 \\  \hline

Then it's got \textbf{nothing} to do with religion, values, or numbers of people for you, just how much melanin or lack of melanin there is in the skin? That's up you but it's a fairly superficial reason to like or dislike someone.This country has benefited enormously from immigration, but you are entitled to your opinion and don't have to like other people, that's your right.The United Kingdom is part of  a commonwealth of countries based on the \textbf{old} British Empire. If you want, maybe stand for parliament and make your platform that you want the UK to pull out of the commonwealth.And of course when you do,  petition the monarchy to return all those jewels to the countries they were taken from. And be sure to get the British museum to return all the dead bodies stolen from Egyptian tombs which are now on display for public viewing.You've got to give respect to get respect, but when people act superior to others they are only living out a fantasy of their own making.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nothing, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}2/191 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.047 \\  \hline

Have your stupid jewels or mummies or whatever else. I don't value that stuff.."Stupid mummies? They are human remains that are on display in the nations premier museum, they were buried and dug up by grave robbers and still in 2015 they are on display.

It's got \textbf{nothing} to do with your colour, it's how you act and the image you project. When I used to hang around the streets I was stopped by police almost constantly, sometimes more than once in a day. Since I grew up and started dressing differently I've had virtually no encounters with them.They seem to socially profile certain people that dress a certain way, especially if your wearing a hoody or hat. As far as the everyday person is concerned I think they're just hesitant of young people in general from all the propaganda about 'hoody culture' in the news. Doesn't mean they're \textbf{racist}.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Laila Jean YuLol at the only people who arn't \textbf{racist} are \textbf{black} people!!! Have you heard of afro-centrics??? They rain on every countries history making it must be \textbf{black}! They are \textbf{racist} as fuck. I am Eritrean, north-east \textbf{african} from the \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} sea. We look, feel and act different from \textbf{black} africa. And they feel the same towards us.....But they are \textbf{racist} towards us, and we are not. There is no color or \textbf{ethnic} based \textbf{racism} in Eritrea, since it's in the \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} sea......the ultimate crossroad....we are used to asians, indians, egyptians, sudanese, arabs, hebrews, greeks, romans and turks for millenias doing shopping. But we knew little of west, central, south and east africa. So there is a huge cultural barrier because of that. But we don't hate based on \textbf{ethnicity}, but they think we hate them or that we are \textbf{racist}. And they hate arabs, and whites..... They just assume that everyone is against them, so they become defensive and even attack! Only time we for sure show \textbf{racism} against them is when marriage comes to question......but we are \textbf{racist} towards europeans and others too when that comes to question. So there is a very very long way from meeting a \textbf{black} guy on the road to marriage purposal. They just need to respect themselves more and stop being critical. Luckily, not everyone is like that...and there is a huge difference between north american and south american blacks, and the "negroid" blacks of Africa. The jews that lived millenias in europe are surely not the same psycologically as those who lived in more or less in peace in Isreal all along! It's luckly hard to generalize!
