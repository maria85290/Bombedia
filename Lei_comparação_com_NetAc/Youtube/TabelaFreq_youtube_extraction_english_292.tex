I did that very same act in kindergarten when we were learning about the Native Americans, my guess is in that moment she couldn't think of another way to differentiate the Asian \textbf{Indian} and American \textbf{Indian} cultures and just goofed, and it is very obvious that she immediately regretted it.

That's where the problem is, not what her color is, but her disposition towards a group of people based on what little knowledge she gathered from \textbf{old} western movies(perhaps). It's like the idea that people from Texas are gun wielding \textbf{hillbilly}, or \textbf{black} people are thugs playing loud hip hop in their cars. She is running for a major position, she has to know and understand the diversity of the people and the value of their \textbf{ethnicity}.
