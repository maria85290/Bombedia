That's where the problem is, not what her color is, but her disposition towards a group of people based on what little knowledge she gathered from \textbf{old} western movies(perhaps). It's like the idea that people from Texas are gun wielding \textbf{hillbilly}, or \textbf{black} people are thugs playing loud hip hop in their cars. She is running for a major position, she has to know and understand the diversity of the people and the value of their \textbf{ethnicity}.

\item The percentage of hate speech related words is 2.1589.

\item Considering that the variable \textbf{Ethnicity - General} has the most occurences in the post, we can interpret that this is the predominant hate speech.

\item Overall there were 73/167 occurences of hate speech related comments.\end{itemize}\end{document}
