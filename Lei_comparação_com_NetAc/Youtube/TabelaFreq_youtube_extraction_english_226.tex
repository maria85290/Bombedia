I think this 'survey' (sarcasm drips here!) really is a divisive attempt at pushing a 'we and they' attitude, whereas most Australians understand the terrible past but think we are better off moving on to an inclusive future without divisively teaching the progeny of our forefathers a debilitating outlook of what a past, they have no physical connection with, could have on our united future if we were all one in a mature \textbf{nation}!

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Firstly, Australia belongs to every Australian, irrespective of \textbf{ethnicity}.  I refuse to be a 2nd class citizen with LESS rights than an Aboriginal based on my \textbf{ethnicity}/race/culture/skin colour.  Secondly, every Australian irrespective of \textbf{ethnicity}, should have access to any benefits paid for by Australian tax payers and that should be based on need, not on \textbf{ethnic} or racial grouping.  Aboriginals get MORE based on their race/\textbf{ethnicity}.   Thirdly, life choices are made by individuals.  We are constantly told that we are individuals and that we can do anything if we set our minds and hearts to achieving those goals.  When I compete against an Aboriginal, I struggle with one hand tied behind my back.  What I do is not good enough because an Aboriginal gets "help" even if they do not work as hard, are not as smart or don't put in the same hard yards I do.  I get put down and \textbf{nothing} I do can change that because of my \textbf{ethnicity}/skin colour.  That also makes Aboriginals racists.  I am not a superman but just a man struggling and I truly resent Aboriginals when they get MORE simply because of their \textbf{ethnicity}/skin colour.  Every Australian deserves to be treated EQUALLY and what we then go on to achieve is based on the effort we put into our lives.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnic, Ethnicity, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}4/218 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.835 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Aboriginals today have more rights and benefits than every other \textbf{race} in Australia.  I tell my children to work hard to achieve what they want in life, to sometimes sacrifice fun today in order to improve their lives tomorrow.  Now I have to tell them that no matter how much they accomplish, someone else, an Aboriginal will get into the course on lower marks, get the job just because of their \textbf{race}/ethnicity/skin colour (eg ticking the Are you Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander is not simply for statistical purposes) and even have a job created specifically for them eg Aboriginal Liaison Officer etc simply because of \textbf{race}.  My children will lose out to someone with lower marks, less/lower/perhaps no qualifications, less dedication, less individual intelligence.  That is not a good thing both for the individual and for society as a whole.  I will always fight for my children and in the future for my grandchildren.  If they miss out because someone better pipped them, fair enough.  Try again, work harder.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Sorry, that's not all correct. Yes, Indigenous people were exposed to new diseases after colonisation but that was not the main reason people died. People in charge of settlement decided that the people of the land were a dying \textbf{race}, and they could speed up the process by placing them concentration camps. There were massacres. Some involving people being tied up and sent to jump off cliffs to there death. There was the stolen generation where Aboriginal people were deemed unfit to take care of there own children.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Chandler Eade, you're a bit short on facts to be so dismissive. 1. There was no invasion. In January 1788 the First Fleet landed and there was no conflict until several months later - if the majority of Aboriginals did not want them to settle, they could have easily wiped out the entire British settlement. 2. It is not \textbf{racist} to talk about racial heritage and bloodlines, Aboriginals do it themselves all the time. 3. Both \textbf{black} and white people were killed - in fact it is estimated that between mid 1788 and 1934 around 20,000 Aboriginals and 2,500 whites died. 4. Hundreds of thousands of Aboriginals died from the unintentional introduction of diseases like smallpox, and not from any war. 5. Less than 30,000 Aboriginal children comprised the "stolen generation", but over the same period 250,000 white children were also "stolen" by government agencies. But we don't hear about that....because the \textbf{racist} Aboriginal biased narrative in this country only allows for Aboriginals to have suffered. No not the end - not by a long chalk, because it won't matter what day we celebrate as Australia day, there will always be 'Aboriginals' named Sven, choosing to ignore their 93.75 Swedish heritage, just so they can whine about "surviving the invasion".\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/210 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.429 \\  \hline

This concept became offical in 1951 called the assimilation policy, where all aboriginal families were forced to give up there children and assimilate them into 'white society,' this was discontinued in 1969 but there were already many biracial children and they were much lighter than their parents or grandparents.

I`m sure thats being discussed on other youtube threads too.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Ocean Runner, 1. Yes I've read Bryce's articles before and he wants a bet both ways. Bryce himself concedes this subject remains a "debate" because he accepts that history is susceptible to error and exaggeration (as I assert is the case), but he also concludes that oral accounts from centuries past are reliable - when it suits his stance. I question his impartiality because of his obviously duplicity in this regard.2. Is just the original article that was reprinted as 1 on your list, - but look at the language used "unequivocally support the idea" - That's just an unequivocal collection of non-committal terms designed to create the illusion of evidence and truth, but in actual fact it is just weasel words for "this is what we want you to think, but we have no real evidence to support it". 3. I'm not going to dignify that \textbf{communist} rag with any comment other than - "Are you seriously citing this \textbf{commie} buIIshite?" Come on Ocean Runner, I thought we were having an adult conversation.4. ARRRRGH - The Guardian. Oh dear, so you are quoting a renowned buIIshit rag that quotes another article by itself, which concludes that there were some 6000 attacks (massacres) killing some 65,000 aboriginals JUST IN QLD, of which 57 were at the hands of "Native Police" i.e. Aboriginals in police uniform. So they were slaughtered by other Aboriginals! Hmmmm....The numbers don't add up either! Even if there were 750,000 aboriginal people in 1788, it's estimated that at least 70 or 525,000 were decimated by diseases like smallpox, TB, measles etc, which leaves only 225,000. A toll of 65,000 just in QLD alone would have represented total annihilation nationally - which we KNOW is not true. This is my point - any logical analysis of these myths and numbers proves them to be exaggerated drivel and lies.5. You can't be serious Ocean Runner? According to this cretinous drivel, the settlers polluted the water, and killed off the kangaroo population within months of arrival, resulting in aboriginal people being close to starvation. Hahahaha - I've read some biased idiotic self-serving buIIshite in my time, but this takes the cake. If you believe the crap on this website to be true then there is no hope for you.Ocean Runner, I'm glad you are looking around for information, but if you can't tell the difference between chocolate cake and a prairie cake, then you're destined to swallow a whole lot of buIIshite in life.I'm fortunate to have lived long enough to have visited the Aboriginal Tent Embassy on the lawns at (\textbf{old}) Parliament House, when it was our Parliament House in the 1970's. The change in stories, vernacular, demands and expectations between then and now is dramatic. "Sven" is now a machine - a very well educated and highly funded machine. They're not just about representing Aboriginal interests anymore, they are manipulating any opportunity for political and financial advantage. It is now a business...an industry in fact. "Sven" have manipulated legions of white self-flagellating "useful idiot" naive uni students to do their bidding for them. Read between the lines and do the simple math to expose "Sven's" buIIshite.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Ocean Runner, You can't have it both ways mate - you're just like Bryce. YOU held up "our history books" to be a source of proof of invasion and I quote you "This invasion is quite evident and obvious and written in so many of our history books." But now you write that a lot of our "white" history books deliberately left out information - so the inference is that they are untruthful! Hmmm - proof when it suits, but untruthful when it doesn't. Stinks of double-standards to me. I'm very well aware of your perspective, but in many respects it's based on "Sven's" exaggeration and lies. You don't seem to understand my issue with that? If you take away the undue inflammatory exaggeration and lies, perhaps you might have formed a more balanced view. Balance and careful planning can resolve all of Australia's issues, but Sven doesn't want to resolve anything.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Ocean Runner, I think it is patently obvious that I have thought about it. Your argument is illogical. If our history books are just white man's fiction, and the generationally passed on oral accounts of Aboriginal people are just their 'Chinese whisper version of history', complete with the KNOWN compounding cumulative errors that that process entails, then on what basis can anyone base anything as truth? The only truth is that we need to address the terrible issues faced by Aboriginal people in Australia TODAY. For example - are you aware that an Aboriginal \textbf{woman} is about 35 times as likely to be hospitalised for domestic violence injuries, than other Australian women?  As long as "Sven" and his legions of "useful idiots" keep our country mired in self-serving historical blame game debates, the real problems aren't being addressed. Aboriginal people are dying today, because we are still debating UNKNOWNABLE history in buIIshit blame games created for "Sven's" advantage.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Peter Hobbs Mate. I said many of the documents written by white settlers refused to admit they invaded Australia but not all. Original journals have been investigated. One in particular was the journal of Governor Lachlan Macquarie. In his own words openly talks about the massacres of aboriginal people in one particular area. It's in the third link I provided you. Read the following extract - "On 9 April 1816, Macquarie secretly instructed crown troops to hunt down and massacre Aboriginal people. Writing in his journal the following day, Macquarie noted that he had 'ordered three Separate Military Detachments to march into the Interior and remote parts of the Colony, for the purpose of Punishing the Hostile Natives, by clearing the Country of them entirely …'He further recorded that he had 'directed as many Natives as possible be made Prisoners' and that any resisters were to be killed and their bodies hung from trees 'in order to strike the greatest terror in the Survivors'.During Macquarie's war, which continued until November, the bodies of slain warriors were decapitated and their heads sent to museums in Europe. Aboriginal 'prisoners of war' were transported to penal colonies in Tasmania. Aboriginal children were removed from their families for 're-education'. And British settlers were granted permission to shoot and kill Aboriginal people who were deemed to have violated the various proclamations issued by the colonial government. These are all results of an undeniable invasion. it's written in \textbf{black} and white from a white man in a position of power. To deny an invasion is just ridiculous. There are many other instances where similar massacres occurred where white settlers forced aboriginal people off their lands.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!5}1/281 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.356 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Peter Hobbs January 1788 was the day the invasion started. You seem to think that if it wasn't an all out war in the first year then it doesn't seem to count.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Peter Hobbs Nice try pal but you've already lost the argument. You certainly talk yourself up which is amusing. \textbf{Nothing} funnier than watching a self appointed expert crown himself haha!            Anyway, now to correct you on a few points. For starters the Native Police you mention as part of your argument weren't formed until the mid 1800`s, some 50 to 60 years after the settlement date. So going by your own argument, (which I personally disagree with) you cannot include this as it was too far after the settlement date. By your own words (not mine) "You can't have it both ways"      Another point you fail to admit, is that the formation of the native police was also forced upon the aboriginal people. It was really a case of become the attackers or the defenders and be driven off your lands and quite possibly slaughtered (see Governor Lachlan Macquarie journal).                To this day there is real evidence of over 120 massacres dating back to 1788. Governor Arthur Phillip wrote in his own journal in 1791 that he granted ex-convicts allotments of land at Prospect Hill and The Ponds. He made entries in his journal that he also gave them authorisation to shoot Aboriginal Australians in the area to drive them away from their lands. The very definition of an invasion there. Hello???             Another point I`d like to raise to you is the various definition of the word invasion. Most describe it as the taking over of land by force. No where in any definition is there a time limit. You seem so confused here thinking that if it wasn't quick and immediate it wasn't an invasion. Showing a lack of experience here Hobbsy. Once again, just a little naive on your behalf. Happy to educate you on more when you're ready pal.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I'm a fully white Australian, I respect the Aboriginal culture and I see where these people are coming from. I celebrate ANZAC Day just like every other Australian, despite my great-grandad being killed in Gallipoli. Do I sit here and say why are we celebrating tragedy? We lost many lives that day why do we call ANZAC Day a celebration? I look at the positives of history, yes people died including my own blood but in the long run the Battle of Gallipoli formed Australia for what it is today. We take pride in our sacrifices in war and we celebrate them. I understand what happened to the Aboriginal people on the 26th and onward but I believe as a country we need to look at the positives. Yes what happened was terrible, yes \textbf{racist} white people came over and did \textbf{racist} things, but in the long run that formed a country and that country Australia is the greatest country in the world. No matter what date Australia Day is celebrated on, people will always complain, if you want equality than every persons voice is meant to be heard at the same level, no matter \textbf{race}, religion, social position etc. so in reality the minority of people who want the date of Australia Day to be changed should not justify the whole decision for simply being the Indigenous people of this land. We mourn over the sad history of this country and celebrate the future of this beautiful country and the generations to come. This day has always been controversial and unfortunately it always will be as over this subject there is no date that all 24 million people will agree on.

Here in the Territory, easily the largest percentage of ATSI people in Australia, they dont even include First Australians in the official unemployment figures because it would make our beloved Top End look like the welfare state it is. Highest rates of infant mortality, incarceration, domestic violence, \textbf{alcohol} and drug abuse and the list goes on - again, said statistics are only trotted out when the 'blackfella lobby' wants to make a political point and ensure funding. How many billions of white man's guilt money is it going to take to turn this around ? Imagine growing up in a family where no-one (including cousins, uncles and aunts) had an income other than social welfare payments - that's not even remotely sustainable and its at the heart of the problem. If you place no value on schooling your kids, how do you expect them to get jobs ? I cant fix it any more than I can fix the brutality meted out to aboriginal people, particularly here in the Top End of Australia, but the welfare state is doing them no favours whatsoever - when the crunch comes, and it will, aboriginal people will wonder who turned the tap off.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}alcohol & \cellcolor{green!27}Behavioural Addiction - Alcohol & \cellcolor{green!27}1/241 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.415 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Celebrating the First Fleet in 1888, 130 years ago, was always a local Sydney event, until 20 years ago. Australia Day being celebrated on January 26 is about all Australian Citizens. \textbf{Nationality} and Citizenship Act 1948 created the concept of Australian citizenship, and came into force on 26 January 1949. January 26, the birth of being able to be an Australian Citizen. This is why the vast majority on new Australians  choose January 26 to become Australian Citizens, as it is very relevant and important date. January 26 is about celebrating being an Australian Citizen, and all the rights being an Australian Citizen affords you, regardless if your first generation, 6th generation or Indigenous. Celebrating Australia day on January 26 is inclusive, as we are all Australian Citizens, regardless of our skin, hair, \textbf{gender} or where we were born.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small So ungrateful !!!Do some research!Don't settle for political lies and manipulation!You SJWs are thick , ...read bellow and learn.There was not just one group of people called Australian Aborigines that came over to Australia, and they certainly were NOT peaceful.Who knows who, or if there was any people from Africa, or somewhere else, before the first groups of what we call now Aboriginal peoples, came down through India.There is evidence of a recent \textbf{race} of \textbf{black} \textbf{African} Pygmy, that was killed off to extinction, by a tribe of Aborigines in northern Australia.Waves of different peoples where constantly coming into Australia, which formed many different tribes, who mostly didn't like each other. Even though they were on the same land, they spoke hundreds, of different languages, which seems to be evidence of not much peaceful socialising and mixing, like throwing prawns on the aussie barbecue. Tens of thousand of years, and they didn't seem to want to learn each other's language. Which makes sence, as it was safe to stay within the tribe. Like all of the ancient world thousands of years ago, conflict and violent barbarism, was everywhere, ..\textbf{nothing} like the safe havens offered to Aborigines to live in today.Over the thousands of years, there was three big major waves, of ‘colonisers' who came down from the direction of India, that landed on Australia, with no doubt many smaller ones in between.Each time different people came into Australia, they came into conflict where they bumped into people that where already there.The same welcome the British had, from the Aborigines, is what thousands of years ago, the oncoming wave of peoples, would have had when they came across the peoples settled before them.There was a constant state of war between dominant tribes, and the smaller tribes would submit to the Dominant ones.The weaker tribes acquired protection from the stronger tribes, and possibly given areas where they would be allowed to hunt. The dominant tribes enjoyed the privilege of being able to take women from the weaker tribes, as well as water from their wells, and any hunting grounds they chose.Under their own laws, which was the \textbf{common} laws of nature, ....the weaker tribe submits to the more dominant tribes, so they would have willingly submitted to the British, once it was obvious they were stronger!Not a bad deal really!They were brought up to modern civilisation, which took thousands of years to create, by European white men.A unique evolution, through technology, art, inventions, wars and many other struggles to achieve!All the free stuff that's thrown at Aborigines now, is not appreciated, especially not by the ungrateful brainwashed, entitled SJW's, who act like they speak for the majority of Aborigines, in this video.Don't let the lies and half truths, from twisted Marxist, lefty politics, manipulate you.However at anytime, Australian Aborigines can hand in their iPhones, and free accommodation, all the acting roles offered to them on Tv, and movies, give up the priority entitlement they hold In many cases for employment, and all the rest of the free welfare, and go into the bush, and live like they used too.Be happy, ...go hunt, create fun rock paintings, rub two sticks together, blow the didgeridoo, and good riddance.That's probably the best solution for everyone.Oh and the whole 'Stolen generation' is not what you have been lead to believe.DO YOUR RESEARCH, DON'T BELIEVE POLITICIANS !\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}African, Black, Common, Nothing, Race & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}5/583 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.858 \\  \hline

The story of our species is one of brutality and competition, just like how the natural world is.

God  built his kingdom and for many many years he tried he created many forms of animals to make it all work for instance he created fish to clean the seas, he created cows and chickens, he created four legged beats of the fields to work in the fields, but after some time he realized gods kingdom just would not work without gods actual spirit within the kingdom itself. So created Adam and eve and breathed life into them and breathed gods own spirit into onto them. He created his own special people known as the Awdawn. Aka Adam. He gave all of this world to his blessed Awdawn people (white people) and in return asked us to live in his image. So he sent us all around gods kingdom to every part of it to civilize and grow fruitful and manage gods kingdom in his own image. This is what we have done we have invented and constructed beyond belief. Infrastructure, space travel, electricity.. etc. This is because God gave us a soul and a spiritual energy that never ends. You on the other hand were created a long time before us back when all of the animals were made. You were made without soul and without the mind power to do the things we have. God gave you the brains to do your job. Work some fields and basically your here to do a job and part of the animal catergory. Some of you are hybrids dating back to when Cain bred to a female beast of the field after drinking alot of alcahol,  slightly more open minded only still without a soul or any kind of spirituality or connection to God apart from what from you were created for.. you don't realize it but the happiest place for you is to be where God originally placed you! Working for Adam and Eve's descendants in our fields. So you need to understand that we did not steal anything from you! God gave us this kingdom! And you will never know the true happiness that God intended for you also until you return to what God made you for. And I'm sorry but you cant blame us gods chosen special people to be like him for what God has made and how God has made it. The problem lies within you! Your trying to be something your not!

Our aboriginal people don't want to cancel Australia Day. They just want to celebrate it on another date. Thats it. There's no doubt that aboriginal people have gradually been treated better over the past few decades.Yes, its true that "most" of the mistreatment of our aboriginal people occurred before our time. But lets not forget that aboriginal children were still "stolen from their families right up to and through the 1960's, also weren't given the right to vote until the 1960`s as well. Up until this time, they were still only considered natives which for that day and \textbf{age} is quite concerning. On a final point, if you're going to mention "anti-white sentiments without mentioning anti aboriginal sentiments, then you're clearly only highlighting one side of the argument.Once again, this debate is about changing the date of Australia Day because its the date that an invasion started and still involved the mistreatment of aboriginal people up until recent times as stated above.

They're events in world history where (mostly white) people harmed another entire group of people because they saw them as different, there for saw them as a bad or wrong in some way. And if you are from that group of people, you might hold onto that pain, with some caution or even fear that history could repeat itself. In today's \textbf{age}, with people being more conscious of \textbf{racism}, maybe things are better.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small +Tommy Orr Jr  Even today domestic violence, incest and alcoholism is high among aborigines.  During extensive interviews with aboriginal women, their response, when asked if they would turn back time if they could, was that European men taught aboriginals equality between sexes, and their lives improved since 'invasion day'.Several years ago I became aware that aborigines were given homes and cars by the government - things Europeans worked all their lives for.  The result was an Outback littered with the rusty carcasses of their abandoned vehicles, because they couldn't be bothered servicing or fixing them.  They'd simply apply to the government for new ones.  Their homes became bonfires through floorboards being set alight during corroborrees.  Our country is an entire continent, a 4-hour plane ride from east to west; aborigines bemoan that their country was taken over yet most of us have never met face to face due to the distance between us.  If aborigines want to live by their \textbf{old} nomadic traditions, why do they simultaneously  accept homes, cars and welfare money?  I don't mean to denigrate dark skinned races but one thing they have in \textbf{common} is their willingness to be paid for doing \textbf{nothing}, then bemoan the government's existence and make it and all white inhabitants out to be \textbf{racist}.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small These people are all clearly mixed \textbf{race}.

As far as I see it your messed up family history is not my business. Dont get me wrong, I'm not saying that the european settlers didn't commit a huge crime or that modern \textbf{racism} doesn't need to be addressed and stamped out. But clearly if you're mixed \textbf{race} then your ancestors were both the oppressed and the oppressor. You cant just ignore that.Almost all of us can look back and find a point where someone once committed an injustice against one of our ancestors, Robbing them of the future they deserved, (but at least creating the conditions necessary for us to have been born.)I myself was abandoned as a baby, boo hoo. (ok so its possible my ancestors were australian) So you could argue that I was robbed of a certain future, and of a history or culture I'll never know. But that makes no difference to me now, There is \textbf{nothing} I can do about that so why wallow in it.The best we can do is learn from the past moving forward and find ways to make the world better for future generations.Current injustices committed against aborigines (and anyone else) are the issues that really need to be addressed because they're the only ones we can do anything about.Anyway there is a simple solution to this, Australians you should just move Australia day a bit.

In 1788 a bunch of european convicts were dumped on a land that was already inhabited by another \textbf{race}.

This would be the birth of a \textbf{nation} and sadly a death of a culture and the survival of a \textbf{race}.  Years and years of oppression these people would face under the hands of the European settlers and their offspring. The europeans tried a strategy to bred out the pure bloods so they couldn't seek claims in the future by tying up the aboriginal women to a bed and raping them. The aboriginal people were shifted off into less fertile lands. These actions left a rippling effect on generations of aboriginal people that would lead them into a deep depression. Through their vulnerababitly they would undergo psychological and environmental problems making them more prone to bad decision making addiction and crime.

I saw one in in my local Centrelink a couple of years ago and was stunned by what it really said. You could almost hear the background chant "One of us, one of us".Reconciliation seems to be "Sorry we took your land and your home and killed any of your people who got in the way and kidnapped your children, but come live like us, it's the best thing ever!! You'll find us very accepting people if you're happy to adopt our culture. We need to become one, modern country. And look, we'll make movies and write books about all your \textbf{old} stuff, so it won't be forgotten. Come to the city and get a degree and a job and a mortgage and an iPhone...

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I was brought up never to celebrate Australia Day and now I am older I am glad I have no part of it.  Please read to the end of this post.What I see is a \textbf{racist} white Australia still after all these years..I am NOT actually Australian Aboriginal bloodline but I never ever looked at aboriginal people as different to me growing up because some of my best friends were native aboriginals and to me they were beautiful people \& now I am researching True History I am learning Australian Aboriginals are The Real Royalty of Australia Kings Queens Princes and Princesses who never receive the true respect and honour they deserve.  It is a shame that people listened to a \textbf{crazy} deluded man Charles Darwin who was way off in his teachings of Evolution.  And those sheep that followed him and believed native people had \textbf{nothing} to offer and were just flora and fauna.  What absolute rubbish was that mindset!!!!  That psychological warfare on Aboriginals was designed to cheat them out of landrights and to dissolve their natural laws and beliefs which they had developed over more than 60,000 years.Many people have been brainwashed by a failed schooling system that didn't teach Truth.  People are waking up to the horrendous lie that is called Australia Day - the worst thing is to wake up to all the lies your school and community told you as a child -  But the people that have been in control of Australia for so long are good at lying they aren't even the real Royals of Britain - Of course Murdoch who owns about 70 of Australia's media won't put that on the news.What is important is that you who are Aboriginals never ever ever give up seeking the truth - keep going keep living your lives how you imagined them to be - keep striving - keep having a voice - keep following your path - you have every right because of course it really is your country your homelandHow can anyone say Happy Australia Day on a day of mourning that's like saying Happy ANZAC DAY or Happy Remembrance Day (for World War I and II)Seriously why raise your kids to think it's okay to celebrate on Australia Day.  Killing \& separating people \& enslaving them for land and gold is not okay.  Killing isn't  wasn't what "Jesus" taught whose real name was actually Yahusha(yes they change that history too) who followed God YHVH also known as Yahweh.  That wasn't Christian that wasn't Holy that wasn't fair what the Holy Roman Catholic British Royals did to the \textbf{Black} Natives of Australia we call Aborigines.

BUT in saying that, it happened over a hundred years ago, while its still very very sad, you have to move on at one point, don't forget obviously. But without the British all of these people would still be hunting for food, not having clothes or houses or technology, and many may not of even been born seeing as some of these people aren't "fully" aboriginal as some people would say. I understand this must sound very harsh but this generation as well as our parents generation didn't do those things to the Aboriginals, it was a select few of our ancestors (seeing as Australia is a VERY multicultural country now) I'm not saying they don't have the right to be upset because they very much do, it was a terrible thing that was done, but Australia Day is a day that will always be in Australian history and you can't change it.

The White Australian Policy (A policy which attempted to literally breed the \textbf{black} out of Indigenous Australians) was created in 1901 and wasn't COMPLETELY dismantled until 1973 - thats only 43 years ago. Majority of these people don't know their grandparents and some wouldn't know their parents. To this day, their are Indigenous Australian's who don't know their culture, who don't know where they came from and are unable to find out because their was no documentation. They are known as the Stolen Generation. They were treated horribly. Imagine yourself in that situation, can you blame them for not liking Australia Day? Can you blame them for the way they feel?

It could have been ours together.  You started to go 'Mine'."  He said that the Indigenous people were willing to show their way of life and share the land, but they weren't treated like humans.

Firstly, should one's ties to the land be determined by how long that land has been occupied, and can you only say you are of that land after a certain amount of time?

Take China as an example, some of the earliest "Chinese" inhabitants were \textbf{black}, very different from the norm of today, but I wouldn't question the legitimacy of anyone's sense of belonging despite the fact that they are technically immigrantsNow I'm not saying that immigration to South Africa or Australia was handled ideally, and a lot of what happened was atrocious in its undertaking, but regardless of past sins one should be able to feel as sense of belonging to the country that one lives in, and should not be treated like a fraud because your ancestors haven't been there as long.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!5}1/168 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.595 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small +chaiTV I'm a direct descendent of Tasmanian Aboriginals. I've just spent the past year of my life doing aboriginal studies and my family has published about three books on the matter. Trust me, I'm plenty educated on the matter. It is quite literally my family history. Having advanced technology and medicine means \textbf{nothing}. It's great for us because it's what we were raised with, we adapted to living in a life filled with technological and medicinal advancements. However, the Aboriginal people adapted to life without those advancements and lived just fine without them. For 40, 000 years to be exact. They were more aware and cautious of the dangers of their environments because they knew that they couldn't combat poisons. They had their own methods of surviving off the land and it worked extremely well for them. And you think they didn't work out how to set a bone? You think they didn't have their own medicines? Not all medicine needs to come from artificial chemicals, you know that right? Sure, they probably had their tough times, just like people today do, but just because you couldn't possibly imagine surviving without technology and advanced medicine, it doesn't mean that they had a tough time managing it (again with the arrogance of thinking you're somehow better or your life is somehow more fulfilled because you had things they didn't). They suffered far more hardship when the ships came in then they ever did before the Europeans came. And all these advancements, whilst they did make improvements and bring to life marvellous things, they also came with their own set of problems. Some of them far more complex and damaging than anything that ever existed before. You're holding onto the belief that the European lifestyle was somehow better or more fulfilling because of their advancements, when really the Aboriginal people led very fulfilling lives. They lived their own way but Europeans were so arrogant to believe that their way was the right way. There is no right way to live. You can live in technological luxury or live off of the land. The only thing that determines which is better than the other is perception. There is more to life than advancing nations. Whilst advanced technology and medicine is fantastic, it isn't required to lived, and it certainly isn't some stamp of superiority.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!27}1/391 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.256 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Iron KhaleesiSounds to me like you want it both ways. Well, you can't. When Aboriginal people wandered down to Tas, they couldn't get back once the sea level rose. Stranded in Tasmania during the ice \textbf{age}, and here you are  thinking they lived "just fine". Just because they survived the ice \textbf{age} in Tas, doesn't mean they were "just fine". Not having sailing boat technology meant they were stuck. Isolated from their mainland families for thousands of years meant they missed out on the few things that mainlanders did invent such as boomerang and other tools.  Look, I respect the lengthy survival time of these people, and their general connection with the land and nature. But their small numbers suggests high mortality and limited life.  Their "land management" is way overhyped in my opinion. They would burn huge areas of bush just to attract roos who would come to feed on the seeds left over etc. It was clunky inefficient and only sustainable because of their low numbers in this huge land. They had no scalable system, not even close. What they did have was a huge piece of Earth all to themselves. Lucky. Okay, so you may put all the good things about their culture  into a bottle, but don't hold that up as the complete story. Yes of course there was admirable harmonic qualities, but don't underestimate the fight for survival that took up most of their day. Only a few thousand people in Tas... no wonder their impact on the environment was low. Scale the population up and there's no way on Earth that Indigenous methods would work in terms of feeding and sustaining large numbers. Let's enjoy the stories of pre-technology times, and acknowledge the wrongs and crimes of some settlers such as child abduction and mishandling of land. But you'll never convince me that 40,000 years means they had 40,000 years of peace, harmony and happiness. Aborigines were keen to trade for flour and tobacco and many other things. If they were "just fine" they would have said "no thanks" when given those new things.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/351 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.57 \\  \hline

They hardly had any contagious diseases because they were so healthy and they were never introduced to them. This is why when the Europeans came over heaps of them became really sick and died the Europeans they gave them all of the western diseases they had no immunity to.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small +AnotherFastnet70 Firstly I'm a \textbf{woman}. Not sure how you missed that. And secondly, had you actually read any of my responses properly, you would have known that I already discussed this topic. I distinctly noted that I am grateful for what I have now, and that most of todays generations would not be able to successfully live without our advancements as we have adapted to living with them. But that is not at all relevant to this discussion. My argument is about how Aboriginal people lived very successful and very fulfilled lives before the Europeans invaded, and that they deserve far more respect and rememberance than was given to them. I am trying to dispute the very \textbf{common} assumption that they were no better than savages that were better off when the Europeans arrived. And of course Aboriginal people fought back. They were being invaded and their people were dying of diseases that they'd never encountered before. As I said in one of my previous comments, evidence suggests that long before the Europeans arrived, northern Aboriginal nations had already been trading with fishermen from nearby countries and islands. Not to mention, every community spoke a different language, so don't blame this all on misunderstandings and language barriers. I don't care about what the apparent orders from Europe were, I care about what happened. Sure, language barriers and misunderstandings probably caused some conflict here and there. But entire communities were slaughtered. Diseases were intentionally introduced. Concentration camps were created (some of them so bad that they were inspiration for Hitler). Children were stolen from their homes. None of that happens just because of language barriers and misunderstanding.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Common, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}2/276 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.725 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small So you are a \textbf{woman}. I didn't care to look at your tiny thumbnail picture so my apologies on this minute oversight. You speak of diseases being intentionally introduced. Care to elaborate ? It is very likely the smallpox disease came from the fishermen who visited from the Indonesia archipelago, where it was endemic. No First Fleet members were found to have suffered from it. Draw your own conclusion there. Not too sure how you can possibly say I'm blaming "all this on misunderstandings and language barriers" when I clearly said "The colonists did not understand Aboriginal society and its relationship with the land and the Aboriginal people did not understand the British practices of farming and land ownership. The colonists did not sign treaties with the original inhabitants of the land. which was possibly a mistake. No doubt language was a barrier". You seem to cherry pick very well. The facts are that human conflict has been an inevitable part of living on this Earth for thousands of years so stop playing the victim card all the time. I don't condone what happened with regards to children getting taken from their parents but what can I do to change it ? What can you do ? A "sorry" was demanded then when it was delivered by Kevin Rudd it was quickly forgotten and the same \textbf{old} arguments resurfaced.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small +AnotherFastnet70 The diseases were not introduced by the Indonesian fishermen. When the Europeans established trading with thw Aboriginals, they exploited that by trading materials and blankets that were riddled with diseases. It wiped out approximately 90 on an entire community in one night. A community that had just so happened to be having dealings with the Eurpeans and not the Indonesians. I haven't cherry picked anything. Language barriers and misunderstandings. 'Misunderstandings' incorporates the rest of what you said pretty well, and it was easier than listing every single thing you said, if you haven't noticed, my comments are quite long. And I'm well aware there has always been human conflict, I wasn't born yesterday. But this wasn't a conflict. This was a purposeful slaugher and destruction of nearly an entire culture ans \textbf{race}. They tried to breed Aboriginal characteristics and attributes out of them for christ sake. And again, if you jad read my previous comments properly you would know that I jave already said I know \textbf{nothing} can be changed, but all I want  to get through peoples heads is that what happened deserve to be acknowledged. And the Aboroginal people that lost their lives because of the invasion deserve to be commemorated. And you really think an apology was going to satiate the anger and sadness that people felt? If I came around and killed your parents for no good reason, then issued an formal apology once would you be happy with that? I didn't think so. When the apology was issued, Aboroginal people, including myself had hoped that it was just the first step towards a proper acknowledgement and commemoration of what happened. But then \textbf{nothing} else happened. So of course people got pissed again.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nothing, Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/288 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.042 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small +AnotherFastnet70 I haven't asked for an apology at all. I asked for commemoration every year, that's the only thing that will make Aboriginal people believe that we are truly sorry for what happened. Yes, they have benefits, and that's great. But throwing money at a problem and apologising once just to shut people up isn't going to appease anyone. The problem is that everyone seems to forget what happened. And they don't want that. They want to know that people understand the sacrifice our families had to suffer in order for Australian society to be the way it is today. And it'd be great if the last remaining Aboriginal communities were just left alone to live on their land rather than be moved around every couple years for mining. How is that too much to ask? And it's \textbf{nothing} but pessimism that makes you believe we would want more than that, and there's \textbf{nothing} I can do to fix that.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!27}2/160 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.25 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small +chaiTV  I feel like I'm beating my head against the brick wall now. The first half of your comment I've already discussed with you, and I'm about to retype everything just for you. I never said there was frequent communication between communities. But when they did communicate with each other it was through dance and paintings. Which were and still are beautiful forms of communication if you ever get to watch it happen. Different dialects doesn't suggest conflict nor isolation. Each community had several different languages. You keep thinking that they thought of communication the same way Europeans did. If an \textbf{Elder} of the community died than quite often they ceased to use the dialect that the \textbf{Elder} most commonly used as a sign of respect. Yes the communities lived apart. But that doesn't mean they were isolated. Each community had their own rules and were led by their own Elders. They lived and talked differently. That doesn't mean they never saw each other or that they hated each other. Yes, of course there would be conflict sometimes. Misunderstandings happen. People get angry. But there certainly wasn't conflict to the extent that there is today amongst people. They didn't just go around fighting each other whenever they crossed paths. And of course they had exceptional land management skills! Did you not read anything that I wrote about how they managed the land?? And so what if not all communities managed the land the same way?? There wasn't one right way to do it!! Many of them lived on different types of land. And who cares if they didn't all unite together to create one big \textbf{nation}?! Why does that matter?! They didn't care about creating technology or capitalism. They didn't care about making money. They just cared about their community. They were happy living the way they did. You're so arrogant to believe that living the Europeans way is the only way to be happy. Sure they were evolving a little slower, but so what? Was it hurting anyone? No. And everything in life is trial and error!!!

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@manzilla48  European technology was more advanced thanks to OTHER cultures , Algebra is Arabic , the number 0 is Arabic and gunpowder and paper and the first printing system was Chinese. Gunpowder is Chinese and so much more is thanks to other places outside of Europe.I'm not trying to hate on Europe here but Technology and Culture aren't the same but they often affect each other. For example the internet was created as a way to transfer data , look how much that simple invention has changed culture throughout the world. Also saying ALL of European culture was advanced is a serious mistake , Russia still had slavery like systems ( serfdoms) in place as late as the \textbf{Communist} revolution.. Portugal and Spain wiped out millions of native Americans and forcibly converted them to Christianity.Now what i'm saying may be a bit confusing but let me clear it up : No culture is superior over another , they're unique but not superior (it's like food , theres' no real better food , it's all opinion.  ") but when you have communication between cultures ( like the silk road , the ancient one) it brings idea from other cultures back and forth and these idea inspire some to do more research leading to more discoveries and inventions this is how cultures affect Technology . Genghis Khan arguably bought gunpowder from china when he used gunpowder bombs to invade modern day Persia and was witnessed by a European diplomat to the Khan.This is why Native Americans and Aboriginals were in the "stone \textbf{age}" because they didn't have much interaction with outsiders and since all of their enemies were animals or people with the exact same weapons as them , they never had to "upgrade" their weapons to be superior so technological advancement was slow. Also there was a lack of domesticated animals there so they 1) weren;t immune to \textbf{common} diseases from animals and 2) couldn't do mass farming like the Europeans and Asians and Africans did which lead to 3) a small population and more isolated groups. Because all farming had to be done by hand. ( have you ever tried using a llama or a kangaroo for farming before!??!)Now back to cultures , waaaaay before the vikings set foot on Vinlan the polynesians colonized thousands of islands in the pacific and even went as far as south America and traded things like Kumara ( Maori word for sweet potato) with the tribes. They were excellent seamen waay advanced for their time , but to you , they seem like savages.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Common, Communist & \cellcolor{green!27} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Age - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}3/434 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.691 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Asante Mpanda Very well said. I find it rather strange and curious that anyone would ever say "Oh well the past is the past" so conveniently when they aren't part of the minority of people that was affected. Seems a bit funny to me, but not in the literal sense of the word. More so in the sens that it's just rather amusing that the same people who lightly brush \textbf{ethnic} and racial issues/history would also be pushed to dirt level within their own \textbf{ethnic} background.As a person of mostly European blood [very mixed in that aspect] born to Mexican parents as a United States citizen, I find it disturbing that no single white person has the guts to acknowledge what their people have done to literally every other group of people around the world. It truly baffles me sometimes how easy some are to remove the guilt feeling simply because it leaves a bitter taste in their mouths. I'm pretty sure minorities have more than just a bitter taste to what's been done to them. Ironically, however, I'd still be classified myself as a minority mostly because of my surname and my heritage [as well as my partial indigenous blood] so it all comes down to labels really. While mostly necessary, there is always going to be stigma attached to every which label being placed on anyone. It's an uphill battle for all minorities and all 1st \textbf{nation} people. As per this thread. I wouldn't worry too much about the opinions some of these youngsters bring to the table mostly because they still are learning and their frontal lobe cortex [like most teens] isn't fully developed so their sense of judgment is truly impaired.

I put far more care on the people than their culture, if they want to retain a culture that is NOT COMPATIBLE with the dominant culture unfortunately that's only going to work somewhere else. Thousands upon thousands of cultures have been utterly destroyed throughout history...and that's the only reason we are here today. If it wasn't the evil white man in the late 18th Century...it would have been the evil FAR MORE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCED CULTURES of a later period which would have found and colonized Australia.I feel it's a massive shame the Aboriginals were isolated for so long that once contact was made they felt the massive disparity in culture and technology that they did....but the aboriginals were not the only people to experience this. I think it's much better the way things happened...than the British as a military force considering the Aboriginals to have been a direct competition that LEGALLY had to be removed before colonization was allowed (as happened with the American military and the native Americans..)...because there'd be absolutely no aboriginals left, the hard truth.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small +brioesque  sorry for taking so long to get back to you, one of your comments appears to be missing. I don't remember ever suggesting there wasn't military confrontation...the aboriginal military started plenty of conflict of it's own. What's more \textbf{racist}, the notion of struggle between two military powers with vastly differing technological capability or that the natives be treated like 'savages who didn't know any better' and should have been physically restrained but not harmed and broken down like wild animals? Both happened, which do you think denotes a greater respect?"indigenous ppl did resist, strongly" < Exactly my point. This was by no means a peaceful meeting, this goes back to my original point, that if the Indigenous peoples were considered true rivals or equals that must have been removed to occupy the land (the British were always going to occupy the land.) it's possible they wouldn't exist today to even talk about."we're taught this idea of "terra nullius" " < I'm starting to wonder where you were educated if you were educated. The 'evils' of the white man and their 'terra nullius' are entrenched in young Australia minds at the start of their secondary education. From my personal experience history was warped to present this idea of 'peaceful' and 'noble savages'....as if the Aboriginals were simpler folk...more comparable to deer than man. Sorry for the strange speech, something about this particular topic seems to draw that out of me.My main point is that Aboriginals are no different than any other uncivilized (by literal definition.) culture that come into contact with a civilized culture. They are human and despite their vastly inferior military power are still a violent and proud bunch who were crushed under the wheel.
