  \cellcolor{green!27}\small There should be a mandatory yearly test for everyone over the \textbf{age} of 65 to make sure they still have the ability to drive.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Yay someone else who had a like minded idea :)I do not believe their licenses should be taken away, I belive there should be an \textbf{age} cap at 65 years \textbf{old} (and every 3-5 years after) where you have to go take your driving test again and whatnot.  Here is why I think so.I live in an area in Arizona that is just surrounded by older drivers (65+) and when the snowbirds (Snowbirds - older people escaping the snow where their main home is) come down I am almost terrified for my life some days, I've watched several wrong way drivers (80 of the time it's the older generation), crashes, and just several other scary incidents because they are not fully aware of some of the road rules, as in round about, yeild signs, and others. And on the other hand I've seen a few older people that are in their 90s it looks like and they drive just as safely and aware of what's going on around them as other drivers in their younger years. Not everyone should have their licenses taken away. If we could start a petition to do this retest of the drivers license, it would be much safer on the road for everyone.I understand that even 30s as you said we're just as likey to crash or cause accidents as an 80 year \textbf{old} but there is only so much anyone can do. And as he said in the video I agree that there should be stricter driving restrictions.Hopefully we can make something happen to have a safer time driving from A to B and so forth.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}3/276 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.087 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I think a very important statistic was missing from those figures, that being: How many \textbf{old} people are on the road vs young people. If you look at this chart  [LINK]  you can see that there are significantly less 75+ drivers than 25-29 drivers. This is from 2008 but you can extrapolate to 2019 and not expect a huge difference in numbers. So, what i'm saying is, older people probably are far more likely to have an accident, relative to the same number of young people. Love the videos!

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I'm not gonna question the numbers but to 80 year \textbf{old} driver safer than a 35 year \textbf{old} seems to not be true. With the way the chart is put out it appears like that, but I'm gonna guess there are alot more 35 yo than 80 yo in the world.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I'm 39 yet l have seen a decline in my driving ability. The decline is far more because l don't drive anywhere near as much as l used to and this is the same issue with a lot of older drivers, most don't drive much so loose their skills. And as pointed out in other comments, the amount of time spent driving by the average 20 year \textbf{old} is very different to the average 80 year \textbf{old}.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}2/77 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.597 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I work for the largest used car retailer in the \textbf{nation} something that I've experienced with my clients is that the older customers drive less. I recently received a car on trade from an 87 year \textbf{old} it was an 08 Accord with 37k miles. He said he wanted his last car to be a luxury dream car that we had. As we got ready to go on the test drive the car all of the sudden revved up. It felt like it hit 6500 rpm. He was like whoops wrong one. I was so shook we didn't leave the parking lot. Does the charts from AAA consider how much driving the older drivers actually do?  A person in their 30s would be most likely commuting every day to their jobs 10,000 to 15,000 miles a year. A person in their 75+ would most likely be going to their grocery shopping on Sunday morning 5,000 to 8,000 miles a year.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nation, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/160 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.25 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small exceptionally poor journalism. Your statistics dont talk about proportional incidence of harm.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small After a certain \textbf{age} people should renew their license every year. A ban would be complicated. Even Juan Manuel Fangio were banned from driving in Argentina cause he was too \textbf{old} (\textbf{elder} people were not allowed to drive there in the past), but he managed to get a "special license" later and that prohibition is not applied today anymore - I remember that one time I got in a cab in there and the driver was more than 80 years \textbf{old} - on a manual transmission car.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Andrew Gisler, that's the point: driving is not a "privilege", like some people say... Driving is a necessity - especially if you're \textbf{elder}, with a lower income and no closer family. Most of them wouldn't be familiar with Uber, por example. If they're not capable of driving anymore, OK - the only way to make sure other people's lives are protected is by taking their license away. But you cannot presume someone can't drive just based on their \textbf{age} - the time between renewals is what should be reduced, maybe to and year or some months if you're older than a certain \textbf{age}.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Elder & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}3/103 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.913 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@caiovarela Well driving must be a privilege since it's granted to you by the government. Which is why it's okay to set a standard for people to maintain a license. I do agree we should have more testing after a certain \textbf{age}. I also think getting your license should be more difficult.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The possibility of having age-out of driving privileges is largely moot when you consider that the \textbf{elderly} make up a large section of the voting population.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I'd like to know if the data from AAA accounts for total driving events per driver. Perhaps even better would be, relative time behind the wheel per driver. My concern is that \textbf{old} people do not likely drive as frequently, nor as far as younger people with jobs, kids, etc. and a greater need to drive. Average time spent on the road may account for the disparity between young' and \textbf{old}'s proclivity for accidents. In my humble opinion, \textbf{old} people tend to drive way too slow. My gut tells me that this type of behavior causes others to drive more recklessly, or at least evasively to avoid such slow traffic. Hence, \textbf{old} drivers may well be the cause of collisions in which they're not even involved.

She cant see and drives in the middle of the road at night cause "the center line is the only thing she sees". Her little car has 13,000 km on it!! and has been in more minor accidents and in the ditch more times than i can count. Ive had to grab the wheel and steer us out of the ditch, or out of the path of an oncoming big rig, and take over driving in general when she cant park and has a panic attack.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The driving starting \textbf{age} for young is about brain development (maturity) with regards to adequate decision making (i.e. wreckless speeding, jumping out of your moving car because you saw someone do it on youtube, texting while driving at speed in the pouring rain [seen it], etc) and not about fast motor skills. For the \textbf{old} it's about eyesight, brain cognitive health (i.e. dementia) and motor skill health issues (i.e. arthritis, full range limb movement, etc).

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I think that at 60 or 65 people should have to re-take the driving test under much heavier scrutiny, and should they pass, have to re-take the test every 2-3 years under that same scrutiny.

I like the act of driving, even though I have a boring '09 Subaru Forester that's automatic with about 150hp if I remember right. But holy shit I hate actually driving because of just how stupid people are on the road. 3/4 of the people I see on the road are on their fucking phones. 1/8th are people who are too \textbf{old} to see 50ft in front of them, and the remaining 1/8th are ok drivers.Really, we need to ban stupid drivers, and, I don't know... maybe have a test that a retarded sloth couldn't pass, instead of how it is now.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small another factor in all of this is how easy it is in america to get a license. my driving test was literally just going around the block in a circle and parking back at the dmv in a very easy straight line park job. I didn't have to do a 3 way turn or parallel park or anything that really should be tested before you get your license. Not too sure how it goes in other states but i can say that in Oregon we got the biggest idiots on the road and the older folks are always turning without a turn signal, braking super hard when they have 2 car lengths to the car in front while were going 30 mph. Not all \textbf{old} people are like this but he majority i see do these things (and believe me i see a lot of drivers on a daily basis since i'm a delivery driver) so i would say we definitely need annual testing per year after people hit 70. I also realize i will hit that \textbf{age} some day and I 100 would still agree that we need annual testing when i hit that \textbf{age}, not because i think ill be one of those idiots on the roads but because i know plenty of people right now that are my \textbf{age} that shouldn't be driving and as they get older its just gonna get worse.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}4/236 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.695 \\  \hline

Drive a ton? You better drive slow a ton, because your probability of getting flashed goes up the more miles you drive. This is why taxi drivers only ever drive fast in cities. They don't put speed traps up in cities, only stationary cameras, which they know all the locations of. on the motorway they drive like an angel because they will rack up those points 3-6x faster than a typical person by virtue of being on the road more. With regards to the kill-death ratio of the oldies-but-rollies, they only ever drive to the shops, where they're killing as many people as 30yo who drive all over. Thats the issue Roland.

If you wait for people to realize that they are a danger ... most of the time it will be too late.Test people every other year from 65 to 75 and every year after that. It can be a simple test going around the city for 15 min, it doesn't have to be a complex test.

But most cops just blame speed to call it a day, or drivers who were at fault, just to save face. Being the 31 year \textbf{old} I am, I have never crashed because I train myself, even though I live in a place that has snow 8 months of the year, and that's because I do donuts in the snow and train myself, and I've gotten myself out of what could've been bad crashes.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I've actually talked about this at length with many people. I do agree with Nolan that we should just have stricter requirements for getting a license in the first place. It's laughably easy for most competent people. I would advocate for a practical driving exam for everyone every 5-6 years. Let's face it, we all know tons of terrible drivers regardless of \textbf{age}. Forcing people to actually retake the practical exam is important since people don't ever have to take it again after they pass it the first time, except for the written exam if you move to another state. Then you bump that up to every 2 years after a certain \textbf{age}, probably 65 then every year after maybe 70 or 75. The sobering fact of the matter is, human beings just weren't meant to live as long as we do. We extend our lives well past our general expiration point due to medical science but at the cost of our cognitive and physical abilities.I know this is extremely controversial for many reasons. The primary being, driving seems like a general right that everyone should have and \textbf{nobody} would want their right to drive taken away from them when they get \textbf{old}. But many of us forget that driving is NOT a right, it's a privilege. Driving is a dangerous thing that can kill you and others on the road. The other reason that it's so controversial is because many older people view driving is one of the final things that they can do autonomously. Even when their health begins to degrade and they can't walk or run like they used to, they can at least still drive. But their need to feel that freedom puts the lives of everyone else at risk.The problem with data like Nolan used is that it isn't the whole picture. Sure they might not be more fatal than other \textbf{age} groups but they are certainly more detrimental. We don't just label fast and reckless driving as dangerous. Police give tickets for people driving too slowly too. That is because it impedes traffic and creates dangerous situations that may force other people to drive more recklessly in order to avoid them.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Nobody, Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!27}5/369 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.355 \\  \hline

There are more 25 year olds on the road to create a skewed accident margin, more of them on the road means more opportunities for accidents, and the reverse of it being true for the 80 year olds.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The answer is always and definitely YES, WE SHOULD. It's safer to drive surrounded by drunk 20 year olds than by sober 80 year olds.\textbf{Elder} drivers caused less deaths and injuries on the road just because they are fewer than those in their 20s and 30s. We do have regulations for speeding, taking drugs and \textbf{alcohol}, typical young behaviours that cause most accidents, but we need regulations for elders, cuz our population is aging and they are a serious danger on the road, even if they are not drunk or high, just for being \textbf{old}.My wife is a psychologist who gets people tested, but tests are just not strict enough. Many people over 80 or even 90 pass their tests easily even if they are slow to think, can barely move or stand on their feet. She had to deny many \textbf{elder}'s permissions just for observation cuz they passed the test buy they were still a very obvious hazard to anyone out there on the road.Edit: the top \textbf{age} should be 80 btw, it's generous enough, many people die of a heart arrest or a brain stroke much earlier, things that can randomly happen at any time of the day (for example, while driving) and there's no body over 75 agile enough to react to traffich stimuli as an average driver would. If elders are, as you say, "responsible enough", they'll just stop driving.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Elder, Old, alcohol & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Behavioural Addiction - Alcohol & \cellcolor{green!27}4/237 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.688 \\  \hline

The ONLY practical source is from insurance companies - and what they are told on applications. PERIOD.  And that is virtually fiction. Applicants can essentially get away with saying anything they want.But where it REALLY plays in to debunk the AAA study is that elders who keep their same carrier (certainly a heavily significant number) don't revise their app when they renew. Thus, when they retire and their annual driving drops from 20,000 per year down to 2,000, THE INSURERS STILL REPORT 20,000 TO THE STATISTICIANS.The statisticians and media purveyors of their incompetent nonsense don't tell you that, huh?Thus the damages PER MILES DRIVEN is wildly higher for older drivers.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Quite well researched! I agree that what we really need is stricter requirements for getting and keeping a license. Getting a driver's license is stupidly easy - 15 minute drive on quiet side streets that only checks to see that you don't screw up royally. And then only once - I got my license at 16 and have never had any formal training (except for a somewhat disappointing "skid camp") since, and most drivers probably never will have any checks or training the rest of their life except maybe a quick vision test at the DMV. I have a pilot's license, and I think that's much better - much more involved to get it, and to stay legal one must fly with an instructor who signs off that they still have their stuff once every two years. I think that should be done in cars, make someone re-take the test - a more thorough test than we have now - periodically, maybe more frequently at an older \textbf{age}. That's really the only way to do it. Especially as aging varies so much person to person. This is true of kids growing up - I've seen 10 year olds with maturity better than many adults - but even moreso of elders, some shouldn't be driving at 60 while others are fine at 85. As for the perception that elders are bad drivers, I think that comes not from accidents but sharing the road with them. They often drive excessively slow, are oblivious to other drivers, and so on, in general are a nuisance. Crash likelihood alone isn't a good measure of if someone should or shouldn't be out on the road, their ability to decently cooperate with other drivers should also be a factor. The damage they cause in crashes is probably relatively low because - for good reason - they tend to drive slower, this doesn't mean they are a "good" or "competent" driver. One thought I've had is that if an \textbf{elderly} driver is like such, they should have a bumper sticker saying "\textbf{elderly} driver." I'd be much more patient with such an \textbf{elder} - especially if they are conscientious of it - than a car going excessively slow for no apparent reason, and would know to give them a wide berth.

Also, that has to do with more than just capabilities. Factors such as stress, sleep or lack thereof, weather, time of day those miles are being driven, and so on should all be accounted for.

I know plenty of people whose driving skills are terrible and they're in their 50's, while a lot of people in their 70's are excelent drivers.The solution for this could be that whenever your license expires and you're on your way to get a new one you shouldn't be able to just go and grab a new license without any tests. Their physical and \textbf{mental} health should be tested and they should take another driving exam where the examiner determines if they're healthy enough to drive the car safely.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I believe they need to bring back figure 8 tests and the 'drivers test' is more like an hour long drive within the city driving to make sure you understand correct ethics of merging onto highways, stopping at stop signs/lights, the indications of \textbf{y\textbf{e\textbf{llow}}} lights, the dangers of going 'too slow' and 'too fast' in areas, and if the weather is a possibility -- weather simulated regions to confirm you understand how to operate a vehicle in that region. I am pretty sure a drivers course like that would give 16 - 18 year \textbf{old} anxiety, but it would effectively change how safe we are on the road. I'm a firm believer in that a person going 10 over the speed limit is not as dangerous as a person going 10 under the speed limit. I'm also a firm believer in you should 'merge onto an on ramp' at the speed of the traffic you're merging, not at whatever speed you 'feel like' at that time (Ergo -- you shouldn't merge at 30 if traffic is going 60). I also believe teaching drivers how to properly drive in rain and snow (or rather, confirming the driver understands this before they actually are given a license) would effectively decrease the risk of accidents during weather-permitted times.Although the only state that would ever probably try this would be Cali (and I'd praise them for this), I believe that doing this would literally decrease the amount of accidents, next to actually placing a \$400 minimum ticket on distracted driving, as we have in NYS.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Old, Yellow & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - Asian (East- China, Japan, Korea, Philippines, Vietnam), Nationality - Chinese, Nationality - Japanese & \cellcolor{green!5}4/262 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.527 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Drive is a privilege, not a right. Any state should have the power to restrict driver's licensing if the driver cannot pass a test.

You take a test at \textbf{age} 16 and that is all you are supposed to need forever? Driving situations change all the time. Cities add bike lanes and change traffic patterns all the time.

This problem isn't helped by the fact that the driving test that a person took in the 40's or 50's isn't up to the same standard as one in the 21st Century. For some reason people have made this seem like an attack on \textbf{old} \textbf{age}, when to not retest someone for a skill, that they potentially haven't used in 60 years, before they get behind the wheel of a car completely devalues the point of having a test in the first place.

The only down side is he drives a bit too fast but he never had a crash before.  His reflexes are a bit slower but he had awesome reflexes to start with. Now he's a good example of a proper driver. On the other hand, my father, by his late 50s was a danger on the road. My father relaxed too much and was not focused on the road. And he was too stubborn to realize it. I was not a bad driver, physiologically or technically but didn't have the right mindset.  Myself, I've seen sick for over a year with (prescribed) drug induced hepatitis and stop driving because I felt dizzy and my awareness was way off. I still drove for a couple of months but I realize now it was a stupid mistake that luckily didn't hurt anyone.\textbf{Age} should not be a limitation but physical measurable data should do that for you.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Captain FALKEN It's complicated. Everything deteriorates with \textbf{age}, not just aerobic endurance. Speed/power tend to drop off first, followed by aerobic power and endurance, then strength. \textbf{Mental} capacity degrades as well. But all of them can be partially offset by training, and your physiological prime isn't necessarily where you get peak performance. For instance, with strength athletes, even though you start losing some physical capacity for adaptation in your mid-twenties, they typically won't peak in their sport until later, because you can keep building muscle, albeit at a slower rate. Similarly with chess players, peak learning ability passes well before you see a dropoff in performance.  These effects are more pronounced with people who haven't been at peak performance their whole lives, and so you can see major improvements in \textbf{elderly}, previously sedentary people if they start exercising.\textbf{Age} matters. That doesn't mean you're washed up and unable to accomplish anything at all when you hit 60, but by that point you can pretty much abandon the idea of becoming a leader in a field you're not already an expert in, and progress will generally be slower, or you might only be able to slow your decline.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Elderly, Mental & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}4/197 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.03 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@RAIDERZILLA If you don't understand that those stats that produced the graphs are heavily skewed, I can do \textbf{nothing} for you.

Look, I'm all for people doing whatever the fuck they want to do without government interference, but when you become a hazard to people and their property, there is no other option but annual testing.
