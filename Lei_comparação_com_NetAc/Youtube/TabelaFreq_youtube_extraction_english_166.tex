  \cellcolor{green!5}\small If corporate Amerika isn't going to hire seniors, and government refuses to enforce laws protecting \textbf{senior} employees, then the \textbf{age} for collecting social security should be reduced to 40 years of \textbf{age} to counteract the rampant discrimination that is practiced in corporate Amerika today!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Senior & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}3/44 & \cellcolor{green!5}6.818 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small He seems eager to reinforce the lie that a younger worker is higher value across the board.  How many businesses these days will not hire a worker over 40, but have tremendous turnover and cannot keep their young hires even coming to work?  How often do you go to a business where younger workers are discussing their personal problems in front of the clientele?  He ignores the differences between perception and reality and claims a person should be able to be fired based on \textbf{age}.  Ok, but only if they are losing their performance and not because you think they just seem too \textbf{old}.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}2/104 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.923 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Honestly, this is wrong because \textbf{age} is definitely everything everyone would come across. you cant fire someone because they are \textbf{old}. the reason why most of us don't understand this yetÂ is because we are still young and don't know what it feels like to be called \textbf{old} until you get to 50 or 70 and become slower in life.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}3/60 & \cellcolor{green!5}5.0 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I guess people think that there is a way to not \textbf{age}. The only way I know how is to die. All young people out there should realize that they don't want some asshole to fire them just because they got \textbf{old}. Fuck these companies that just want to use you upland throw you away. And fuck you Stossle, I hope this happens to you.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}2/65 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.077 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small True. And all businesses should know that we have a right to examine how they conduct their business in our communities and whether we want to continue to patronize them or take our business elsewhere.No "new" opportunities are created though (as Stossel asserts). Businesses are moving deck chairs on the Titanic to keep costs low and profits high. The Cousin Brucie segment was a laugh. I think he's too \textbf{old} to own and run stations--and perhaps older Americans should stop listening to any stations he owns.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}1/87 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.149 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Its not that they cant do things, its the fact that young people bring an appeal thats different than \textbf{old} people. Thats what people want its a business not a charity. No one has a right to a job.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}1/39 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.564 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Age discrimination isn't only about \textbf{age}, it's making distinctions among people because of how they look too. Some companies will hire a cute 20 year \textbf{old} guys over someone over 40 because of the way they look. Making distinctions among people because of their \textbf{age}, \textbf{sex}, religion, and origin is wrong. That is why many \textbf{black} people were slaves 150 years ago, and women couldn't vote less than 100 years ago. Why Americans can't learn from their past?\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Black, Old, Sex & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - Black, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}6/78 & \cellcolor{green!5}7.692 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Companies do have the right to run their businesses they way they want. But that doesn't make it right. If I had a restuarant, should I have to right to ban people because they're \textbf{black}, \textbf{g\textbf{ay}}, and \textbf{old}?\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Gay, Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - Black, Sexual Identity - General, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality & \cellcolor{green!27}4/38 & \cellcolor{green!27}10.526 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Whether if it's because you're \textbf{old} and young, it's still \textbf{age} discrimination. \textbf{Age} discrimination should be treated as bad as discrimination based on \textbf{race}, and \textbf{sexual} orientation.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Old, Race, Sexual & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}5/27 & \cellcolor{green!5}18.519 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Hooters actually took more preemptive measures to help in their case. All waitressess are actually hired "performers", because actors/performers can be hired based on their \textbf{sex}, \textbf{age}, and skin tone. There's still all \textbf{black} schools where white children aren't welcomed and the government isn't concerned with them (nor should they be). I think if an all-white private school existed today and blacks weren't welcome, it probably wouldn't get much business from non-racist parents.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Black, Sex & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Ethnicity - Black, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/73 & \cellcolor{green!27}4.11 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Age discrimination is unavoidable.  We're all going to get older so we'll all face it.  Plus it's hard to prove so what else can you do?  \textbf{Nothing}.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}2/27 & \cellcolor{green!5}7.407 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Boeing CEOs dont really do a lot except advertise and sign contracts. They have a purpose, but the McDonnell Douglas/Boeing legacy is what brings customers back. They get paid about 2M a year, and live off of the company credit card. The President is just a figure head and he made \$23M last year. They will probably just shut down South Carolina once they clear the back order of the planes. Since they are nonunion, \textbf{nothing} will stop that from happening.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!27}1/81 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.235 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Yeah that's why when it comes contract time, the rich CEOs do \textbf{nothing} but complain about how much we cost them in wages and benefits. I don't know if you heard, but the 787 has been having problems because of uneducated, nonunion work. Boeing broke the law via the contract they agreed to by moving the plant to South Carolina when it was supposed to be built near Seattle. They made  the move to break away from the union. Today Boeing stock dropped \$3 a share as a result of the deal.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}1/92 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.087 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Then Reagan stepped in and changed the laws allowing for golden parachutes to CEO's who fail. So now the average CEO makes 400 times the average worker, the last time that happened was 1929. We have more total unemployed people than ever since then. Now since the job market is wide open unions cant stop the \textbf{race} to the bottom since their involvement is weaker than ever. Then the companies turn the public against unions by brainwashing then through the media.That's why it's a boss's world.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Race & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/86 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.163 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I will get \textbf{old} someday. When that day comes, and I have physical limitations I don't want to be denied my willingness to work for that reason. I have also seen older people walked out the door, because they can't produce over 500 parts a night. People that worked for companies for 40 plus years to lose their jobs like that. If they know about the \textbf{age} discrimination laws, then they can fight back.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}2/74 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.703 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small If your company considers guys like the ones you described non-productive, your company is \textbf{dumb} and they deserve to lose good workers!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Dumb & \cellcolor{green!27}Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}1/22 & \cellcolor{green!27}4.545 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I work for Boeing. In my department we have two guys that are 78 years \textbf{old}. I am 27, and I can do more work than the both of them combined. I make mistakes on the job, and they very rarely do. They can tell me how things were done before computers were integrated into our machines. Since all of my background before Boeing was with computer operated machines, I lack many skills that they have. So with a skilled job, older workers are great for their knowledge by making younger ones grow faster.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}1/94 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.064 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small age is not the issue. cost is the issue. younger workers are more willing to take abuse, willing to work cheaper, and cost less for health insurance.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/27 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.704 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small what does that have to do with my comment? sometimes starting a business is easy, sometimes its hard. so what? that has \textbf{nothing} to do with keeping deadbeat relatives on the payroll. why not give those that helped you grow that business a little bit instead of paying someone because they have the same last name as you?\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}1/58 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.724 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Lol to you, Look how john Stossel is doing, hes giving info to the people so effectively, and by people I mean like you. I want people who can work in my Company and I don't want \textbf{old} people working sooooo slooooowly. And yet \textbf{old} people are expinsive compared to young people, Look you, Its my money and I get to spend it how ever way I want it. If I want you fired cuz your slow, then YOUR FIRED MR..

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@evilillusionist so by that logic, shouldn't it be unfair for someone to leave their job to work somewhere else?  the business should be entitled to keep their employees if the business was treating them well enough.  also, if an \textbf{old} person is productive, then why would they be fired anyway?  what business owner in their right mind would fire someone making them nice profits?  clearly, discrimination would not be the cause of the firing, so the law is unnecessary.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}1/79 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.266 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small 2 GeneralMills777, I agree that there are limits to the governments involvements in our own personal and business decisions, but there are ethical and social responsibilities that we should hold as a \textbf{nation}, it has been those ethics that held us together during the depression and re-building our country.  We need to be doing that now. I am a business owner, and I do hold to social responsibility standards.  My word is my word to an employee.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nation & \cellcolor{green!27}Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/77 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.299 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small If the older man is being productive enough to hold his own, there should be a law protecting against discrimination. Of course he won't be hyper-productive, but if he's making the business enough profit to merit his employment, why in the hell should he be fired? We're all human. We all \textbf{age}.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/52 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.923 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small well let mister stossel get fired and then comment on it. I know he is a libertarian and in a business sens he makes a point, but how would a country be when employers are free to do EVERYTHING THEY WANT. are they gonna throw \textbf{old} people in the dumpster and let them rot?  what happened to ethics and morals? are they being tossed and superseeded by business needs?\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}1/69 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.449 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@studentofsmith Public companies fire and hire indiscriminately routinely. Sometimes they get it right and a lot of times they do not. Many people get fired because of trival reasons. I have seen this at public companies many times. It has \textbf{nothing} to do with the person's work performance. It does not get reflected in their stock prices unless it affects their profit and loss statements. When the top management of the company is bad, it will catch up to them.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}1/80 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.25 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@studentofsmith With the Social Security ages having to be raised, I think \textbf{age} discrimination is going to be a bigger issue. And as a society, you need both \textbf{old} and young in a workplace. The younger workers learn from the older workers. I did. Businesses gain from both \textbf{old} and young. When those younger workers get older, they will want the same protection as they complained about when they were younger.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}3/71 & \cellcolor{green!27}4.225 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@studentofsmith Supposedly, employers should not discriminate against older workers when hiring. It is very difficult to prevail anyhow when suing for \textbf{Age} discrimination. The US Supreme Court ruled by 5-4 that \textbf{age} discrimination plaintiffs must show that the sole reason for their firing or not being hired is because of \textbf{age}. That's hard to prove. In the last Congress, there was a House bill that would have made it easier for workers to sue. That bill would not fly in the current Congress.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/83 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.614 \\  \hline
