  \cellcolor{green!27}\small And that's exactly how she would dress. Her style was very simple but very sleek with a hint of dimensional pieces. Two main accessories that complimented the outfits were her big hoop earrings and trendy glasses. She ALWAYS paired the two with her outfit. Every Thursday, I looked forward to her outfits. I, myself have a  passion for style and mixing pieces. She gives inspiration to not just people of older \textbf{age} but to youth individuals as well.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Stop hating and start growing. Most college professors don't have the bank roll to do what you're imagining. If you live long enough, you will \textbf{age}.
