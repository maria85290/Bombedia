  \cellcolor{green!27}\small And that's exactly how she would dress. Her style was very simple but very sleek with a hint of dimensional pieces. Two main accessories that complimented the outfits were her big hoop earrings and trendy glasses. She ALWAYS paired the two with her outfit. Every Thursday, I looked forward to her outfits.
