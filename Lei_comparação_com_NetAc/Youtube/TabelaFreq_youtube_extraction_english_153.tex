  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Effectively what are the police going to do? Issue an ASBO? On the spot fine? If there's an issue they can already deal with it.If you are the victim of discrimination there is legal redress available to you. For example if you are fired due to your \textbf{gender} or \textbf{age} and you can prove it you will receive appropriate compensation. Discrimination is illegal.The question is do we need additional laws to address what is already dealt with under the law?

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small For some reasons, the government wants to control social behaviour. Freedom vs social control has become something normal. Probably the government just wants to control the people, particularly males. But what if a \textbf{woman} doesn't like another \textbf{woman} or fight  each other?

\textbf{\Large Result analysis:}

\begin{itemize}\item Taking into account the words that were detected, we can reach the conclusion these comments are associated with : : Gender - General;Age - General;Physical Identity - Physical Features;Age - Youngsters;Nationality - General;Ethnicity - General;Age - Over 65s;Ethnicity - Black;Social Class - Working class; Ideological and Political Identity - General;Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality;Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments;Religious Identity - Muslim;Nationality - European or anti-Europeans;%.

\item The percentage of hate speech related words is 1.4132.

\item Considering that the variable \textbf{Gender - General} has the most occurences in the post, we can interpret that this is the predominant hate speech.

\item Overall there were 55/224 occurences of hate speech related comments.\end{itemize}\end{document}
