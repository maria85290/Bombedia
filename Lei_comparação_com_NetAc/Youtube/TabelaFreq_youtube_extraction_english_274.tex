"If America were an 'idea,' every country on earth could be America. Electricity is an idea. The airplane is an idea. Washing with soap is an idea. That's why other countries have been able to adopt those innovations. No other country on earth has been able to approximate America — except our fellow Anglo-Saxon nations..."(Ann Coulter, Adios America, 2015, page 51) "America is not a mere landmass — otherwise, the Indians would have written the Declaration of Independence and put a man on the moon. Far from discovering America, Indians didn't even detect America. There was no America until the British and Dutch arrived. They were not 'immigrants' because there was no established society for them to move to. Without the white settlers, what is known as 'America' would still be an unnamed continent full of migratory tribes.."(Ann Coulter, Adios America,2015, p.51) "Every single president, except Kennedy, was a Protestant. (Recent Democratic presidents were, of course, atheists, but all except JFK professed to be Protestants." (Ann Coulter, Adios America,2015, p.53)"For one hundred years before the signing of the Declaration, and one hundred years after, America was extraordinarily un-diverse in \textbf{ethnicity} (British, Dutch, West \textbf{African}, and Germanic), in religious practice (overwhelmingly Protestant, 98 percent Christian), in language (English), and in cultural mores.......And the country remained overwhelmingly Anglo-Saxon and Protestant right up until Teddy Kennedy decided to change it." (Ann Coulter, Adios America,2015, pp.53,54)"Contrary to PC nonsense about America being a 'diverse' melting pot, America has never been a '\textbf{nation} of immigrants.' Most Americans have always been born here.  Even as late as 1990 — a quarter century into Teddy Kennedy's scheme to remake the \textbf{nation} — half of the American population traced its roots to the \textbf{black} and white populace of 1790.(9)" "Nearly the entire white population of America from 1600 to 1970 came from a geographic area of the world about twice the size of Texas. The entire \textbf{black} population came from an area of West Africa about the size of Florida." "Until Teddy Kennedy struck, America was never less than 99 percent white Western European and West \textbf{African} \textbf{black}.(10)  That's 'bi-racial,' not 'diverse.'" (Ann Coulter, Adios America,2015, p.54)"Two centuries after the first Europeans settled America, the white population was  80 percent British and 98 percent Protestant.(12)  A century after that, the populace was  still overwhelmingly English-speaking, British, and Protestant, but, for an exciting  change, also included Germans and Scandinavians.(13) The colorful immigrants at the turn of the nineteenth century were wildly different from the original settlers in the sense that they were white people from a different part of Western Europe." (Ann Coulter, Adios America,2015, p.55)"The entire time it was processing immigrants from 1892 until 1954, Ellis Island  received only 12 million immigrants.(15)"  (Ann Coulter, Adios America, 2015, Page 56)  Can Anyone Prove  the Above Statements  Wrong from a  book called:  "Adios  America" ?43 'The \textbf{alien} who is among you shall rise higher and higher above you, and you shall come down lower and lower. 44 He shall lend to you, but you shall not lend to him; he shall be the head, and you shall be the tail.45 'Moreover all these curses shall come upon you and pursue and overtake you, until you are destroyed, because you [a]did not obey the voice of the LORD your God, to keep His commandments and His statutes which He commanded you.'(Deuteronomy 28:43-45 New King James Version-NKJV)=-======================================================================================================================================Deuteronomy 28 New King James Version (NKJV)Blessings on ObedienceDeut. 28:1 'Now it shall come to pass, if you diligently obey the voice of the LORD your God, to observe carefully all His commandments which I command you today, that the LORD your God will set you high above all nations of the earth. 2 And all these blessings shall come upon you and overtake you, because you obey the voice of the LORD your God:3 'Blessed shall you be in the city, and blessed shall you be in the country.4 'Blessed shall be the \textbf{fruit} of your body, the produce of your ground and the increase of your herds, the increase of your cattle and the offspring of your flocks.5 'Blessed shall be your basket and your kneading bowl.6 'Blessed shall you be when you come in, and blessed shall you be when you go out.7 'The LORD will cause your enemies who rise against you to be defeated before your face; they shall come out against you one way and flee before you seven ways.8 'The LORD will command the blessing on you in your storehouses and in all to which you set your hand, and He will bless you in the land which the LORD your God is giving you.9 'The LORD will establish you as a holy people to Himself, just as He has sworn to you, if you keep the commandments of the LORD your God and walk in His ways. 10 Then all peoples of the earth shall see that you are called by the name of the LORD, and they shall be afraid of you. 11 And the LORD will grant you plenty of goods, in the \textbf{fruit} of your body, in the increase of your livestock, and in the produce of your ground, in the land of which the LORD swore to your fathers to give you. 12 The LORD will open to you His good treasure, the heavens, to give the rain to your land in its season, and to bless all the work of your hand.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Yes, it inherently is. BDS is an organization that wants to isolate and demonize the only Jewish state in the world on all fronts, and which also applies the modern variant of the "kauft nicht bei juden" strategy. BDS is not concerned about "human rights violations" because if they were, Israel would not be their priority. BDS unilaterally focuses on the only democracy in the Middle East while giving carte blanche to genocidal dictatorships such as Syria, Iran, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia. With this, BDS puts aside the most important principle of human rights violations, namely, deal with the worst first. Israel does not come up with this by any measurement. Indeed, according to the world freedom house, Israel has a democratic system that, based on integrity and functioning, is comparable to that of Belgium and America. Fortunately, there is a term to explain this attitude of BDS, namely anti-Semitism.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@mrmiura story Anti-Semitism operates by discrediting Jews and accusing them of barbaric activities. In the past, this was, among other things, the blood libel, the myth that Jews would bake their sandwiches with the blood of Christian children, and now it is the claim that Israel is allegedly violating human rights. This is because the United Nations has been hijacked by brutal dictatorships that have made it their life's work to demonize and delegitimize Israel its right to exist. The fact that countries such as Iraq, Congo, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia are members of the UN Human Rights Council already harms the integrity of these resolutions. Nonetheless, the purpose of these accusations is to be able to characterize Jews as monsters. The consequence of this is that the Jewish people lose their humanity, therefore, offering a justification to antisemites to either eradicate them or, more notable in the present, to argue the annihilate of their only state. Thus, making anti-zionism inherently antisemitic.History shows that new anti-Semites always claim that they are not anti-Semites, but that what they do differs fundamentally from the ideas of their predecessors.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I think the Left has Identity Politics completely wrong.  I am not just referring to this video about Jews, but to the entire AJ+ series about various identities or groups of people. Identities are groups and therefore are constructs of what I call Groupism, the ideology that people should be classified into different groups for the purpose of differential treatments, which is basically the definition of CONSERVATISM.  This is in contrast to Individualism which is basically LIBERALISM.  Think about it, \textbf{racism} is the classification of people into racial identities, \textbf{sexism} is the classification of people into \textbf{gender} identities, and Conservatives are the ones who like to do these things.  Identity Politics are NOT about supporting or affirming identities, the EXACT OPPOSITE, they are about REJECTING identities.  For example, Feminism is NOT about \textbf{gender} groupings, or about affirming women, or about the distinction of the sexes. Feminism is about \textbf{gender} equality, it is a subset of INDIVIDUALISM, the ideology that people should be judged by their own individual merits and not by their membership to various groups.    I think that the Left is being led by poor leadership, by people who just don't understand.  Instead of making documentaries about various identities that I would argue promote fundamentalism instead of tolerance, the only identity that is of unifying importance is the identity of INDIVIDUALITY.   It is not necessary for outsiders to understand the culture and history of Jews, it is only necessary that they understand that Jews are foremost INDIVIDUALS LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.  We need to break fundamentalism, not promote it.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender, Racism, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}5/259 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.931 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Prophecy 57: America you are as a Trojan Horse, but you shall pay a price for this if you do not repent. Anyone who betrays Israel betrays I, YAHUVEH and betrays MY Son YAHUSHUA. Anyone who is an enemy of Israel has set themselves up to be an enemy of I, YAHUVEH the Creator of Israel, also the Creator of America and I YAHUVEH the Creator of the universe.  Any leader that puffs themselves up and makes themselves as a god and says, "I will destroy Israel" shakes his fist in the face of I, YAHUVEH the Creator. America you shall surely pay. America you have already begun to burn, you burn with MY rage, you burn with MY anger. You cry out for mercy on America yet you even want to strike out the NAME of GOD away from the children's memory. I am angry MY Children, for you cry out for mercy on America but the leader of America puffs himself up like a god, he is not a god. I hear the cries of MY People in Israel, yes even those who do not acknowledge MY Son YAHUSHUA but they cry out to ME MY Children, they honour MY Sabbath Days, they keep MY Jewish Feasts and obey MY Torah. Israel carries the blood of YAHUSHUA and Jerusalem carries the blood of YAHUSHUA, though they receive it not. Beware America you are a Trojan Horse. I, YAHUVEH remind you of what happens to a Trojan Horse. I, YAHUVEH and YAHUSHUA now prophesy through MY Handmaiden, I, YAHUVEH will strike down that Trojan Horse and when I strike it down it shall never rise again. I, YAHUVEH and YAHUSHUA will cut off the horses head. I, YAHUVEH and YAHUSHUA will cut off the horse's hooves. You America will not be able to move anymore and the merchants shall cry from afar off, as they will see America burn from afar off. (Rev. 18) You send fear among the world and say, "Stay out of Israel, it is too dangerous to visit" and yet the Palestine enemies who despise MY NAME, to the world you lift them up as heroes and this you loudly proclaim. Oh America, you make this promise to Palestine's, you falsely say, "I, America will give back Israel especially Jerusalem to the enemies of I, YAHUVEH." Palestine's have set themselves up as YAHUVEH and YAHUSHUA's enemies. Palestine's have killed MY Hebrew Children. Palestine's are trying to steal the \textbf{apple} of MY eye. So America, for helping them you have incurred MY wrath and America even your name, I YAHUVEH and YAHUSHUA now despise. I have had mercy thus far, for the cries of MY True Children who cry out. But MY True Children must know this, the longer I have held back MY wrath the angrier I YAHUVEH and YAHUSHUA became and America you will pay for this. So this is a message to MY Beloved Children, anoint your houses once again, cry out for mercy on your own house and I, YAHUVEH will hear you, MY Children, once again. Repent MY Children for your own house for you cannot repent for the sins of America. For the stench of the sins reach Heaven and all of Heaven holds their nose for no \textbf{nation} has done what America has done and yet no \textbf{nation} was blessed like America was blessed. You want to strike out 'One \textbf{Nation} Under GOD' then you will have 'One \textbf{Nation} Under MY Feet.' I YAHUVEH will stomp you, for you just struck out your mercy; you just struck out MY favour. You want to strike out 'In GOD we Trust' from your currency then all you have is 'In (America) we Trust.' I'll show you what happens to a \textbf{nation} that is not under GOD YAHUVEH and YAHUSHUA's protection, it will not be a pretty sight. You will find out America, just how puny you are in your strength and might. You want to strike out 'In GOD We Trust' then America all you have left is 'In We Trust.' For right there you have stated that I YAHUVEH the GOD that set you apart has just struck out MY mercy, you have just struck out MY protection for you rely only on yourself and so America let the world see what happens when it is only in you that you trust.                 Prophecy 58: Butchers I call you, murderous butchers! Your fate shall be that of a butcherous murderer you \textbf{doctors} and scientists.  What you call the Supreme Court in America, the heathen politicians have brought forth this judgment on America. You have no one to blame but yourselves. You are reaping what you sowed. Why do you think that I do not hear the silent screams of the unborn just because you have deafened your ears and blinded your eyes to this murder? Do you not know I created the souls of the unborn as well as the born? Heathens, Pharisee's, how dare you rewrite what I call murder? Who are your politicians to declare what I call sinful lifestyles. Do you think I am impressed, with your new laws? I have shown you judgment on America and I tell you just wait until you see the signs in the sky, and the effects on the earth as the volcanoes, earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, all join together as if in a chorus, singing the song of the doomed. If you think this is horror you have not even yet seen MY wrath begin to fall. And I speak not just to America for she is just a young baby thumbing her nose at ME. I warned MY Handmaiden to tell the people to watch around the day of Rosh Ha Shanah and especially this month and the month of October. Remember what I YAHUVEH warned, 'America I saved the worst for last.' You must wake up and realize you are a country set apart to glorify YAHUVEH and YAHUSHUA and how much praise and honour has America brought 'I AM'? Woe be unto this country if it does not get back to Holiness, 'I AM' the Lord GOD YAHUVEH this is the saddest day for America, without a shot being fired to defend herself, without any notice then that which I speak from MY Apostles and Prophets and how many listened? America suffers great casualties and deaths. I had to allow satan to sift you for you have wandered far from MY paths of Holiness. You say this is one \textbf{nation} under GOD then obey ME. Obey the Holy Scriptures. Deny and reject all that is unholy, get back to the country I loved and set apart. But despite what I told Jonah, I gave her a chance as I spared Ninevah and I shall spare you America, if you will but once again follow MY Laws and stop passing laws that try and change MY Laws that was written with MY own finger in a tablet of stone. I have sent these out with the warnings of Jonah and how few listen until I allowed the horror that befell America today. MY Children tell ME this, as you sit transfixed to your televisions and radio's and watch in horror and shock. Wondering why this is happening? What is the difference between America suffering the impact of terrorism and Israel suffering from terrorism or Kosovo or Africa, and many other places around the world? You casually read it in your newspapers, hear it on your radio's and televisions, or watch the headlines appear on your computers, and yet no country feels the pain until I allow you to feel it hit your own countries until the death toll is your \textbf{race}, kindred, tongue and your nations. Hypocrites! You weep and wail now only because it is your own \textbf{nation}. Now, will you take seriously when others suffer from wars? America, repent and get back to the country I set apart for MY Praise, Honor and Glory, be an example once again of Godliness. Have you so quickly forgotten the depression and the miracles I did? That is why your economy was blessed. I don't want to take you back there again to learn that lesson. Judgment was delayed far too long. (MORE)              Please Pray For America!

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small AMERICA REPENT or RETURN to Messianic Jewishness of YAHUSHUA( Come out of orthodox Jews \& paganic christianity )Prophecy 59: You must urgently get these messages out. Be not so concerned in the order right now. Instead be concerned with the urgency. For indeed I gave Elisabeth that vision when one who speaks for others with itching ears and makes promises I have not said. I showed her that vision of the American flag and as MY NAME is struck out and as MY NAME is off the currency, although it is only generic for although I am GOD,you know MY NAME and as it is struck out of the currency, so too will the protection of America. And as I showed her the flag, it will burn from the bottom right corner, to the top left corner. Until this flag is consumed with MY anger and MY rage. How dare New York, after I poured forth MY mercy and MY love. I spared untold uncounted souls from Sept. 11, 2001 from many days hence as they unburied those that they thought were dead. As I had MY angels chase them out before the buildings collapsed and now they dare to defy what is Holy, they dare to profane the name 'marriage,' that which I have given as a symbol for the Bride and the Bridegroom. It is not man- man. It is not Adam and Steve, it is Adam and Eve. MY anger and MY rage will burn New York if they continue on. I have warned them and I have warned them that Sept. 11 was only a sample. How dare them and every state including Canada and the Providences that follow who dare to do the same. I remind you what happened to Sodom and Gomorrah. Their fate shall be the same. Dare not say that the hedge of protection is around America for this is a lie straight from satan's prophets' mouths. The hedge of protection is around MY People, those that call out in MY NAME. Those that worship YAHUSHUA and those that honour MY True Sabbaths, those that repent and humble themselves, those that look up and know that redemption draweth nigh. MY Babies, Bride, Chosen Ones and Elect, these are the ones the hedge of protection are around. I have torn down the hedge of protection around America and you shall see that flag burn. Be not angry at MY Apostles and Prophets that I send to warn the doom will come. Instead, thank ME that I care so much to warn. I warned this Handmaiden, again and again, I gave her a word an audible word, I told her to tell the people, "I will do all I promise to do." That not only means the wrath to come that means protecting you. I warned her in 1999, people notice the date, if it had not been for the intercessory prayer warriors that arose and fasted Sept 11, 1999. It would have been the same fate as in 2001, Sept. 11. Because I hold back MY wrath because of the prayers of the righteous that availeth much then the Apostles and Prophets are called false. What would you say if I didn't hold it back anymore? Then will you believe MY Apostles and Prophets? Is this what you really want? I have held it back for the sake of those that shudder in fear and tears. MY Little Ones, MY Babies that I cradle in MY arms. I hold it back thus far, not for the sake of a glorified America who has made themselves a god in their own eyes. But I have held back MY wrath, for MY Little Ones who, like a little child, looks up with trust and love to their Father with their eyes. But America, you shall burn. I know this Prophet that speaks forth, her voice is not going to want to be heard. It goes against The Prophecy Club's messages, those that speak of abundance and prosperity, and those that speak of protection though it's undeserved.  So this is MY message this day, as you see the name 'GOD' struck out of the Pledge of Allegiance. As you see the word 'GOD' struck off your currency. The vision I have given MY Daughter this day, you will see the American flag burn and the merchants shall cry from afar off and the world shall weep and lament but will they learn a lesson from her?Oh, how few listen their ears are full of wax, their eyes are \textbf{blind}, they only want to see from their own eyes and they don't want to see through MINE. America, you will reap what you are sowing. Again I repeat, the hedge of protection is not around America. The hedge of protection is around MY Beloved, MY Babies, Bride, Chosen Ones and Elect. Look up MY Children, deny not your faith, deny not the NAME of YAHUSHUA ha MASHIACH. Deny not the NAME of YAHUVEH. Deny not the anointing of MY RUACH ha KODESH. Deny not MY Commandments and MY Laws and MY Statutes, and the Word that was made flesh.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small ''America'' This is the Voice \& Spirit of your creator \& God Saviour YAHProphecy 58: Butchers I call you, murderous butchers! Your fate shall bethat of a butcherous murderer you \textbf{doctors} and scientists. What you call the Supreme Court in America, the heathen politicians have brought forth this judgment on America. You have no one to blame but yourselves. You are reaping what you sowed. Why do you think that I do not hear the silent screams of the unborn just because you have deafened your ears and blinded your eyes to this murder? Do you not know I created the souls of the unborn as well as the born? Heathens, Pharisee's, how dare you rewrite what I call murder? Who are your politicians to declare what I call sinful lifestyles. Do you think I am impressed, with your new laws? I have shown you judgment on America and I tell you just wait until you see the signs in the sky, and the effects on the earth as the volcanoes, earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, all join together as if in a chorus, singing the song of the doomed. If you think this is horror you have not even yet seen MY wrath begin to fall. And I speak not just to America for she is just a young baby thumbing her nose at ME. I warned MY Handmaiden to tell the people to watch around the day of Rosh Ha Shanah and especially this month and the month of October. Remember what I YAHUVEH warned, 'America I saved the worst for last.' You must wake up and realize you are a country set apart to glorify YAHUVEH and YAHUSHUA and how much praise and honour has America brought 'I AM'? Woe be unto this country if it does not get back to Holiness, 'I AM' the Lord GOD YAHUVEH this is the saddest day for America, without a shot being fired to defend herself, without any notice then that which I speak from MY Apostles and Prophets and how many listened? America suffers great casualties and deaths. I had to allow satan to sift you for you have wandered far from MY paths of Holiness. You say this is one \textbf{nation} under GOD then obey ME. Obey the Holy Scriptures. Deny and reject all that is unholy, get back to the country I loved and set apart. But despite what I told Jonah, I gave her a chance as I spared Ninevah and I shall spare you America, if you will but once again follow MY Laws and stop passing laws that try and change MY Laws that was written with MY own finger in a tablet of stone. I have sent these out with the warnings of Jonah and how few listen until I allowed the horror that befell America today. MY Children tell ME this, as you sit transfixed to your televisions and radio's and watch in horror and shock. Wondering why this is happening? What is the difference between America suffering the impact of terrorism and Israel suffering from terrorism or Kosovo or Africa, and many other places around the world? You casually read it in your newspapers, hear it on your radio's and televisions, or watch the headlines appear on your computers, and yet no country feels the pain until I allow you to feel it hit your own countries until the death toll is your \textbf{race}, kindred, tongue and your nations. Hypocrites! You weep and wail now only because it is your own \textbf{nation}. Now will you take seriously when others suffer from wars? America, repent and get back to the country I set apart for MY Praise, Honor and Glory, be an example once again of Godliness. Have you so quickly forgotten the depression and the miracles I did? That is why your economy was blessed. I don't want to take you back there again to learn that lesson. Judgment was delayed far too long. Prophecy 59: You must urgently get these messages out. Be not so concerned in the order right now. Instead be concerned with the urgency.For indeed I gave Elisabeth that vision when one who speaks for others with itching ears and makes promises I have not said. I showed her that vision of the American flag and as MY NAME is struck out and as MY NAME is off the currency, although it is only generic for although I am GOD, you know MY NAME and as it is struck out of the currency, so too will the protection of America. And as I showed her the flag, it will burn from the bottom right corner to the top left corner. Until this flag is consumed with MY anger and MY rage. How dare New York, after I poured forth MY mercy and MY love. I spared untold uncounted souls from Sept. 11, 2001, from many days hence as they unburied those that they thought were dead. As I had MY angels chase them out before the buildings collapsed and now they dare to defy what is Holy, they dare to profane the name 'marriage,' that which I have given as a symbol for the Bride and the Bridegroom. It is not man- man. It is not Adam and Steve, it is Adam and Eve. MY anger and MY rage will burn New York if they continue on. I have warned them and I have warned them that Sept. 11 was only a sample. How dare them and every state including Canada and the Providences that follow who dare to do the same. I remind you what happened to Sodom and Gomorrah. Their fate shall be the same. Dare not say that the hedge of protection is around America for this is a lie straight from satan's prophets' mouths. The hedge of protection is around MY People, those that call out in MY NAME. Those that worship YAHUSHUA and those that honour MY True Sabbaths, those that repent and humble themselves, those that look up and know that redemption draweth nigh. MY Babies, Bride, Chosen Ones and Elect, these are the ones the hedge of protection are around. I have torn down the hedge of protection around America and you shall see that flag burn. Be not angry at MY Apostles and Prophets that I send to warn the doom will come. Instead, thank ME that I care so much to warn. I warned this Handmaiden, again and again, I gave her a word an audible word, I told her to tell the people, "I will do all I promise to do." That not only means the wrath to come that means protecting you. I warned her in 1999, people notice the date, if it had not been for the intercessory prayer warriors that arose and fasted Sept 11, 1999. It would have been the same fate as in 2001, Sept. 11. Because I hold back MY wrath because of the prayers of the righteous that availeth much then the Apostles and Prophets are called false. What would you say if I didn't hold it back anymore? Then will you believe MY Apostles and Prophets? Is this what you really want? I have held it back for the sake of those that shudder in fear and tears. MY Little Ones, MY Babies that I cradle in MY arms. I hold it back thus far, not for the sake of a glorified America who has made themselves a god in their own eyes. But I have held back MY wrath, for MY Little Ones who, like a little child, looks up with trust and love to their Father with their eyes. But America, you shall burn. I know this Prophet that speaks forth, her voice is not going to want to be heard. It goes against The Prophecy Club's messages, those that speak of abundance and prosperity, and those that speak of protection though it's undeserved.  So this is MY message this day, as you see the name 'GOD' struck out of the Pledge of Allegiance. As you see the word 'GOD' struck off your currency. The vision I have given MY Daughter this day, you will see the American flag burn and the merchants shall cry from afar off and the world shall weep and lament but will they learn a lesson from her? Oh, how few listen their ears are full of wax, their eyes are \textbf{blind}, they only want to see from their own eyes and they don't want to see through MINE. America, you will reap what you are sowing. Again I repeat, the hedge of protection is not around America. The hedge of protection is around MY Beloved, MY Babies, Bride, Chosen Ones and Elect. Look up MY Children, deny not your faith, deny not the NAME of YAHUSHUA ha MASHIACH. Deny not the NAME of YAHUVEH. Deny not the anointing of MY RUACH ha KODESH.
