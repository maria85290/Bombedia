You are clearly biased in this argument therefore your opinion on the matter is biased and also moot as biased opinions have no place in fact and are only up for debate (which is what we were doing but apparently this debate can only be one sided since expressing our opinions leads to us being told we have none and are stupid) I am not biased toward either the travelling community or the gorgie community considering I am a gorgie and my children are travellers, I'm as entitled to my opinion as you are if not more so because I am not biased in my conclusions and having lived both lives am more qualified to talk on the subject.
