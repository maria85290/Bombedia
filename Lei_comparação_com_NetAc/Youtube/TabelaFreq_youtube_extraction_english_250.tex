Today, blacks are under attack by satanist. Fallen angels, also known as the Nephilim are what's behind many of the ills in the \textbf{black} community.

They are also hijacking our technology, such as cell phones and computers, email, and social media and blocking our business and job opportunities. Since many of us rely on the internet nowadays for our survival, they are undermining these efforts by hacking into our technology and giving us a mirrored site while concealing the actual site, or email account and blocking important messages. This has led to a massive unemployment problem in our community and many foreclosures and evictions in our community. This is not a joke. It is happening to me and many others.

Whenever \textbf{black} people did try to  build their own cities and began to prosper, \textbf{racist} white people would come and burn everything down (look up the history of the Tulsa \textbf{Race} Massacre) . All hate is bad, but Malcolm X's hate stems from the hate and unprovoked cruelty he received from \textbf{racist} white people. \textbf{Racist} white people on the other hand, were just inherently cruel and evil towards African-Americans  simply, because their skin was \textbf{black}.
