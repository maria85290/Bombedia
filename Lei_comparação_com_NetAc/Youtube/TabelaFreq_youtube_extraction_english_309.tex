  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Before I say anything I want to make clear that I don't lean right nor left to me both are extremes that lead to stagnation. We need globalization, yes. We need unity first as cultures then as nations then as a species, yes. We need the will and strength of one species united to face the challenges the future presents, there is no way around it. But adhering to the right, staying in each and everyone's turf, locking it to the outside world and rejecting all attempts at unification and centralisation, measly as they be (looking at you EU), only results in the stagnation of the country you so love, history has proven this since time immemorial. Also, the left preaching multiculturalism and inclusiveness is just as stagnant as it just widens the gap between cultures and heats up a debate over what is \textbf{nothing}, it is a contradictory movement by its very nature and wether or not they like it humans and cultures will always have some measure of individuality and intrinsic conflict to them no matter how equal the left pretends them to be. In my opinion what we need is a scaling down of globalization and centralisation to more local levels, say continents, more authoritarian governments, a more just legal system, hard prosecution of lawbreakers (regardless of bias), scaling down the influence of big corporations, centralisation of population centres. If united, there is \textbf{nothing} that can stop our species from claiming its birthright. And what is that birthright you may ask? Look around you, marvel at the achievements of your \textbf{nation}, your people, your culture and now gaze to the stars and imagine what our united species could achieve.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Niklan Sovin   Negative.  Europe is not, has not,  ever been predominantly pagan.  Now, time to educate you.    A. Niklan Sovin  Negative.  Europe is not, has not,  ever been predominantly pagan. Little is known about the prehistoric religion of Neolithic Europe. Bronze and Iron \textbf{Age} religion in Europe as elsewhere was predominantly polytheistic (Ancient Greek religion, Ancient Roman religion, Basque mythology, Finnish paganism, Celtic polytheism, Germanic paganism, etc.).But even these was most definitely based on a localized location. Not wide spread. In other words what was practiced  in one village was taboo in another village a hundred miles away. The reader also needs to keep in mind that the worlds population was so much smaller then compared to today. During these times the  population spread across Europe, Western or Eastern Europe was \textbf{thin}. The Best estimates for all of Europe to be no more than 3 million. Spread all the way from the shores of France to the leading edges of the Russian Federation under the czars. The Roman Empire officially adopted Christianity in AD 380. During the Early Middle Ages, most of Europe underwent Christianization, a process essentially complete with the Christianization of Scandinavia in the High Middle Ages. (Before the spread of Catholicism across Europe, paganism and paganistic teachings was always on a small centralized trajectory. There was never any wide spread one particular pagan religion over or on top of another.  Catholics, Catholicism came into being around The notion of "Europe" and the "Western World" has been intimately connected with the concept of "Christianity and Christendom"; many even attribute Christianity for being the link that created a unified European identity, especially since Christianity in the Middle East was marginalized by the rise of Islam from the 8th century, a constellation that led to the Crusades, which although not a spectacular success, if one is speaking militarily only,  but it was an important step in the emergence of a religious identity of Europe. At all times, traditions of folk religion existed largely independent from official denomination or dogmatic theology.The Great Schism of the 11th century and Reformation of the 16th century were to tear apart Christendom into hostile factions, and following the \textbf{Age} of Enlightenment of the 18th century, atheism and agnosticism have spread across Europe. 19th-century Orientalismcontributed to a certain popularity of Buddhism, and the 20th century brought increasing syncretism, New \textbf{Age}, and various new religious movementsdivorcing spirituality from inherited traditions for many Europeans. The latest history brought increased secularisation, and religious pluralism.And because of all of this, for the last 100 years Europe and Europeans entered into what we now call a 'religious dark \textbf{age}.'  Europeans today not all of course and definitely more so in Western Europe compared to eastern Europe that is having no problems with North \textbf{African} Muslim migration, Western Europeans are adrift  pertaining to spiritual matters. Countries that do not stay grounded in a higher belief in God instead of themselves always fall in to moral and social decay. Just look at large areas of America and Western Europe. B.  Catholicism And It's Spread Across Europe \& The Roman Catholic Church. Christianity spread throughout the early Roman Empire, despite persecutions due to conflicts with the pagan state religion. In 313, the struggles of the Early Churchwere lessened by the legalisation of Christianity by the Emperor Constantine I. In 380, under Emperor Theodosius I, Catholicism became the state religion of the Roman Empire by the decree of the Emperor, which would persist until the fall of the Western Empire, and later, with the Eastern Roman Empire, until the Fall of Constantinople. During this time, the period of the Seven Ecumenical Councils, there were considered five primary sees (jurisdictions within the Catholic Church) according to Eusebius: Rome, Constantinople, Antioch, Jerusalem, and Alexandria, known as the Pentarchy.The battles of Toulouse preserved the Catholic west, even though Rome itself was ravaged in 850, and Constantinople besieged. In the 11th century, already strained relations between the primarily Greek church in the East, and the Latinchurch in the West, developed into the East-West Schism, partially due to conflicts over papal authority. The Fourth Crusade, and the sacking of Constantinople by renegade crusaders proved the final breach. Prior to and during the 16th century, the Church engaged in a process of reform and renewal. Reform during the 16th century is known as the Counter-Reformation.  In subsequent centuries, Catholicism spread widely across the world despite experiencing a reduction in its hold on European populations due to the growth of Protestantism and also because of religious skepticism during and after the Enlightenment. The Second Vatican Council in the 1960s introduced the most significant changes to Catholic practices since the Council of Trent four centuries before.Church Beginnings In Europe. According to Catholic tradition, the Catholic Church was founded by Jesus Christ.  The New Testament records Jesus' activities and teaching, his appointment of the twelve Apostles, and his instructions to them to continue his work.  The Catholic Church teaches that the coming of the Holy Spirit upon the apostles, in an event known as Pentecost, signaled the beginning of the public ministry of the Church. Catholics hold that Saint Peter was Rome's first bishop and the consecrator of Linus as its next bishop, thus starting the unbroken line which includes the current pontiff, Pope Francis. That is, the Catholic Church maintains the apostolic succession of the Bishop of Rome, the Pope – the successor to Saint Peter.In the account of the Confession of Peterfound in the Gospel of Matthew, Christ designates Peter as the "rock" upon which Christ's church will be built. While some scholars do state Peter was the first Bishop of Rome, others say that the institution of the papacy is not dependent on the idea that Peter was Bishop of Rome or even on his ever having been in Rome.Many scholars hold that a church structure of plural presbyters/bishops persisted in Rome until the mid-2nd century, when the structure of a single bishop and plural presbyters was adopted,  and that later writers retrospectively applied the term "bishop of Rome" to the most prominent members of the clergy in the earlier period and also to Peter himself.  On this basis, Oscar Cullmann and Henry Chadwick question whether there was a formal link between Peter and the modern papacy, and Raymond E. Brown says that, while it is anachronistic to speak of Peter in terms of local bishop of Rome, Christians of that period would have looked on Peter as having "roles that would contribute in an essential way to the development of the role of the papacy in the subsequent church". These roles, Brown says, "contributed enormously to seeing the bishop of Rome, the bishop of the city where Peter died, and where Paul witnessed to the truth of Christ, as the successor of Peter in care for the church universal".Early Days As Is,   Known. Conditions in the Roman Empire facilitated the spread of new ideas. The empire's well-defined network of roads and waterways allowed easier travel, while the Pax Romana made it safe to travel from one region to another. The government had encouraged inhabitants, especially those in urban areas, to learn Greek, and the \textbf{common} language allowed ideas to be more easily expressed and understood.Jesus's apostles gained converts in Jewish communities around the Mediterranean Sea, and over 40 Christian communities had been established by 100.  Although most of these were in the Roman Empire, notable Christian communities were also established in Armenia, Iran and along the \textbf{Indian} Malabar Coast. The new religion was most successful in urban areas, spreading first among slaves and people of low social standing, and then among aristocratic women.At first, Christians continued to worship alongside Jewish believers, which historians refer to as Jewish Christianity, but within twenty years of Jesus's death, then his resurrection Sunday was being regarded as the primary day of worship.  As preachers such as Paul of Tarsus began converting Gentiles, Christianity began growing away from Jewish practices to establish itself as a separate religion, though the issue of Paul of Tarsus and Judaism is still debated today. To resolve doctrinal differences among the competing factions, sometime around the year 50 the apostles convened the first Church council, the Council of Jerusalem. This council affirmed that Gentiles could become Christians without adopting all of the Mosaic Law. Growing tensions soon led to a starker separation that was virtually complete by the time Christians refused to join in the Bar Kokhba Jewish revolt of 132, however some groups of Christians retained elements of Jewish practice, across the Euro Continent. According to some historians and scholars, the early Christian Church was very loosely organized, resulting in diverse interpretations of Christian beliefs.  In part to ensure a greater consistency in their teachings, by the end of the 2nd century Christian communities had evolved a more structured hierarchy, with a central bishop having authority over the clergy in his city,  leading to the development of the Metropolitan bishop. The organization of the Church began to mimic that of the Empire; bishops in politically important cities exerted greater authority over bishops in nearby cities. The churches in Antioch, Alexandria, and Rome held the highest positions.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African, Age, Common, Indian, Thin & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - Native-American, Physical Identity - Physical Features, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}8/1538 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.52 \\  \hline
