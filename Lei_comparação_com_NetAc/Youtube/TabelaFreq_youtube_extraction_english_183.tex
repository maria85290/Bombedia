I married another man about 10 years later, and one day my son was acting out, being silly trying to get me to laugh, my husband came in the door and misread the situation, He got angry and told my son to stop acting out, he was acting like his dad. My son got so angry, worse then I have ever seen him.  He started yelling, most of what he said was not understandable because he was crying so hard.  My husband just got angrier, so I grabbed him by the arm and we went out to the front porch and I explained the situation, then I asked him to apologize to him he did not see the need, so I said would you do it for me?  So he apologized to my son.  And they got along better after I spent the night telling my husband about my first husband.

It's much better than having parents that trash talk their children and end up destroying their self-esteem.Also, I'd argue I'd be a lot less social if my parents hadn't taught me to be affectionate with my relatives, to say hello to people and stuff.

Also something parents should never do is compare their teens to their older siblings. I got my grades for school back recently and I thought I did really well (and all my friends were encouraging me too) BUT my parents (mainly my mum) was just like "Why didn't you get grade 9? Your brothers did much better than you did when they were your \textbf{age}" and I confronted her and directly told her that if she was trying to get me to do better than comparing me to my brothers wasn't the way to do that and all I really wanted to hear was more of a "Oh well done! Maybe you could've done better but I'm sure you tried your hardest and that's all that matters."

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Also, never tell a child or an adolescent that they don't FEEL something, or KNOW a certain feeling. I see SO many parents, including my own who tell their children, and these are often children suffering through hardships or even depression/anxiety that ''you don't even know what that is, so stop saying you have it.'' you DON'T KNOW what someone else feels, you don't KNOW what they go through so STOP telling them they don't know or feel something. Look into it and keep a closer eye on them instead of denying their feelings or emotions, if they tell you they feel like that or have those experiences then they TRUST YOU, they think you'll care or try to help them, don't write it off, laugh at them or tell them to get over it or that they're just sad, or even that it'll pass by eventually. So many people blame video games and other media for their children committing suicide or acts of criminal offences but this is usually because their parent's don't care enough about them, ad say things like this to them. It gives a child the idea and \textbf{mental} image that they're alone and you don't care enough to try helping them, it brings on a sense of hopelessness and fear and that can cause a wide variety of bad actions to happen because of that.. Don't do that to your children, don't ruin their lives because you couldn't be bothered to care for them, to show them that you love and care for them.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Mental & \cellcolor{green!5}Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}1/259 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.386 \\  \hline

You need to step it up and take charge of your life as an adult." idc what specialist say, saying "I'm proud of you!" wont harm a child's emotional health! personally, i never heard it enough while i was a teen and, due to bullying back in middle school and lack of praise (getting more, usually harsh, criticism instead), my self-esteem shot so far down that i'm to the point that hearing the words "I'm proud of you" causes me to be stunned i even received praise. i felt like i could never please my parents no matter what i did, and my grades and performance suffered for it. on the other hand, saying "I did/I had [blank] when I was your \textbf{age}", puts unnecessary pressure on the teen to push themselves when they may not be ready to take on the challenge. your kids arent YOU, so don't force them to keep up w what u believe is "normal". things changed since u were a kid/teen, and nowadays some ppl tend to do things at their own pace when theyre good and ready. instead of reprimanding the teen for not doing or achieving something, praise them for what they HAVE accomplished even if it does seem insignificant to u. maybe it's a small deed for u, but for your kid it may feel like a big deal. ignoring their accomplishments and instead shaming them for things theyve yet to accomplish may develop resentment in your teen because he/she may feel u want them to be perfect or follow in their parent(s)'s footsteps when they dont want to, or theyll not bother trying to achieve anything because, what's the point?, they wont get recognition for it unless it's an accomplishment the parent wants/will recognize. i have also gone through this and i'm still going through this even at the \textbf{age} of 23, and i'll tell u it gets really infuriating when my parents keep pushing and pushing for me to accomplish things when i hardly get recognition for what i do accomplish. ah, speaking of, heres another thing u should never say to a teen or young adult: "Now that you've done [insert achievement here], you should try to aim for [insert higher achievement here]"! both that and the "I already had a/did [insert achievement here] when I was your \textbf{age}.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Parents don't get it all right...ever, but if you know that they love you and they take time to praise you any way it comes out, please don't worry about the wording!! "Good Job" "Way to go" "I knew you could do it" "You Rock", it's all good!  Respect your parent no matter what. IMO, a lot of kids these days have lost respect for their parents because they think we don't have a clue. Society tells them that, discrediting our credentials as the upper hand or the final say. My now 22 yr \textbf{old} son thought that too as a teen, But today he gets it and understands he didn't have all the answers back then and he's doing really well now!!  We always told him we were proud of him...even when he messed up because it's not what you do that makes us proud, it's who you are that were proud of. \textbf{Nothing} wrong with saying "you're ok" Life isn't going to cater to kids as adults and give them everything they want. Parents have to be tough at times because life is a circus and hard at times. "This too shall pass"  It's prep for later. IMO, kids are not as sensitive as this list seems to say they are. Kids are strong and resilient with tender hearts yes and seem to love a good " I messed up too when I was your \textbf{age}" story..haha.I agree with validating their feelings and emotions all the time, (adults need that too) Kids should always show some respect and love to family. Time goes fast and you never know what that  hug or smile means to the older generation. It makes their whole day. I agree that older siblings are an example but that's pressure they don't need. Each child is responsible for their own actions and should be held accountable. Bottom line, being a parent is not easy and neither is being a kid, but if you know they are trying and respect that, give them a break and don't sweat the small stuff.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Nothing, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}3/346 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.867 \\  \hline

My youngest is 17, and it's so hard to see her go through heartbreak... and often she doesn't want to share why she's so upset.  I just let her know I'm there.  They don't necessarily want unsolicitated advice when they are in emotional pain.  When she's come and thrown herself in my arms, howling from heartbreak, I just hold her.  Whether or not she chooses to tell me what's up is of little importance.  Knowing that she can just be comforted by her mom without being questioned is very important I think.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Not a phrase but when my/parents talk about their problems, it makes me uncomfortable and worse, it makes me feel like I was the cause of it. Since parents work to support their children, it makes me feel like "maybe they wouldn't have as much problems if I didn't come along".Also, it's understandable that parents have struggles like us teenagers/children, but randomly saying things like that instantly put down a good mood. As well as mistakening a joyful little moment in their life as getting a negative response (I made a nice drawing in my style and my parent first complained that the eyes were too big).Also saying that you're overreacting can damage \textbf{mental} health and behavior, it makes me love my quiet and solitude, 'cause then I wouldn't be bothered and be judged or pressured or asked abOUT EVERYTHING I DO (sorry) and this is why I'm pretty much only awake at night.Last, unappreciatednessUsually smart teens are constantly pressured in school once their talents show, they are expected to be the best, they don't care about how well you did in one subject, it becomes so \textbf{common} it isn't impressive anymore.

And here's the best part; even if they do tell you that you're "pretty great" when they're in the mood to like you and be nice to you and aren't ranting about how much of a mistake you are, you can't take the compliment/encouragement because you don't believe they're being sincere, or your own self-esteem has gotten so low that you believe it's a complete lie, and that's how you develop impostor syndrome, among other things.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/153 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.654 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Radheya Salmeen Radheya Salmeen thats a good policy to have in a religion.  A lot of people twist religion into a mind control rather than a way of life and redemption from sins for the soul. I grew up always being told "the bible says you have to respect me because im older/your parent" but people who quote religious texts for their own good tend to dismiss the parts they dislike. There's a verse in the bible that says parents do not trouble your children (not quoted kinda pataphrased). My older brother printed it out at school and taped it on our fridge. He got grounded for 2 months for being disrespectful enough to question authority. Which totally misses the entire point of Christianity. And same goes for any other religion. Study your book if you're going to quote it. Because if you dont you ruin your own image and the image of your religion. I dont know much about the muslim religion but i do believe that there's a lot more to it then what media says and that a mutual respect of all people regardless of \textbf{age} shouldn't be just specific to your beliefs religious or not but rather an act of human decency that shouldnt have to be stated.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/212 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.472 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small As a teenager, I definitely can say this stuff does hurt people in my \textbf{age} group! Especially the "I'm so proud of you" one. "Proud of what, what did I do that made you proud?" and "You don't mean  that" are instantly things that go off in my sister and I's heads when we hear that from our parents. (Actually, our parents have said all these things on the Never Say List. They're not bad parents by any means, but I'm reaching that \textbf{age} where they're less Mom and Dad and more like friends, they aren't super good friends by the looks of it and based on how I've felt about it recently. I've also had a similar experience that was extremely painful and still is that's associated with "be the good role model for siblings" thing. I draw to entertain myself, and the way I learn is to imitate what other people have done by adding some of their technique to my style. My mom stumbled across one of my \textbf{old} school notebooks that I draw like this in and she confronted me and told me to slow down and wait for my sister to catch up- I interpreted this as "stop because you can't be better than her, so don't try to be"). These phrases on the list honestly hurt and I've asked kids at school about how they feel about stuff like those empty responses and they've had the same response as my sister and I did- "they don't care, they're not listening, they're not paying attention, they dont mean it." So, really, DON'T say stuff like this to your teenager.  This list is pure honesty and I'm glad our opinions are getting out there. These psychologists know what they're talking about when they say we'll feel a certain way when someone else takes control, when we're put in uncomfortable situations, when our feelings are tossed aside. Raging hormones are enough to drive us \textbf{crazy}, we don't need insecurities added to the mix. So, yeah, don't say the things on the list to your kids and teenagers- it has a negative impact. Take it from a teen.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Crazy, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}4/360 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.111 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Power Twin Theorists- chat edition , as a person wno was once a teenager and now is a grown up working with teens, I can tell you that  parents do the best they can. As you grow up, you'll understand - being a parent is a really nasty 24/7 job- no shortcuts and no hiding places. Teenagers are incredibly difficult to work with because- simply put - they know \textbf{nothing}, but think they know everything. They have no life experience , but their personality is forming and they somehow think they are the centre of the universe - so their problems are bigger than everyone else's. It's not their fault at all - it's just the way things are. In childhood they were sheltered by their parents and didn't experience hardships- now they are becoming independent and terribly sensitive about everything. (" Don't hug me, mom, my friends will see me and laugh at me!" - you've no idea how hurtful these words can be to a parent- suddenly realising that his  her child is ashamed of his her sign of affection. But, all that matters to a teenager is that some kids will laugh at him her). You see, things are difficult on both sides. Still, both parents and kids need to be wise. Wisdom comes with \textbf{age}, though, and nobody's perfect.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}2/224 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.893 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small naly202 thanks! I'll definitely consider at looking at proko! I've already subscribed to Jazza and I'm thrilled to have met another viewer of his, or at least someone who's researched him! 😄I also really like your suggestion of posting myself in videos on YouTube. I like to draw, theorize, and I'm into the other arts like singing, gaming (It's a skill as much as it can be a pain), dancing (for fun) and playing instruments, and while those are things that are great for my self esteem and effectively keep boredom at bay, it makes it very difficult to know what my channel would be centered around. If anyone has opinions, you can leave a comment...There are already some videos of my sister and I online, if you search for Dana and Morgan piano recitals, the little brunette girls in front of the white keyboard on the right are my sister and I about four years ago. Also on Matt Mullin ALS ice Bucket Challenge, my sister and I did the intro for that closer to five years ago or something, all I know is it happened before we moved. So, I'll definitely see if I can enter the community. I have a microphone set at home I could start with for audio and I don't know where I could get a camera... If anybody wants to be helpful in locating video cameras, if they could comment it'd be appreciated. So, Thanks naly202!As for the parent subject, again, I understand they work as hard as they can (my mom gets a teacher's salary as a paraprofessional teacher's assistant in the school Library and my dad was jobless for a year after First National Bank cut off half of their programing department in my city and I've seen how hard the two of them still work to put a roof over their daughters' heads. I mean absolitely no disrespect towards them- they're my heroes). It's just sometimes I feel there's a disconnect between myself and them,  and that phrases like the ones seen in the video this comment's connected to, are definitely a great source of confusion. I don't often feel like people are insincere, much less my parents, I just feel like they could elaborate on what they mean by "proud" and stuff like that, like, explain why or what we're doing right so my sister and I, and my high school classes, can keep that in mind when we face something difficult and stressful, because then we can think "at least you're good at     , they're proud of you for   . They love you, you can do this." They shouldn't have to protect me if I need to learn a bit on my own to get by. I feel like some conversations can be difficult because of the sides that you pointed out. Like you said, teenagers are in their own little world, for some it might be collapsing around them and others might be only just finding out what the outside works wants from them, and those pressures can be difficult to handle of there isn't a proper emotional support system in place for us. And while some teenagers might seem at a loss for words about what they think about the world,  its because the works is \textbf{crazy} and will keep on spinning on its axis like it always does and with all the stuff going on at times, it seems daunting that another day, a harder day, will always keep coming! But adults know that what life throws at you, you have to make something great of it, and to work even when you're scared of it,  whether it's to get by, keep your jobs, support a family, etc, you're on it. But that's because you learned all this, or at least, many did, when you were a teenager, too. I think the problem is that sometimes both sides forget that the other one is made up of people who have an opinion that no one can alter. Sometimes no one is right or no one is wrong because there isn't always a right or wrong. This is from the perception of a teenager who knows the world doesn't revolve around her, but the human \textbf{race} lives on it and the world doesn't revolve around the human \textbf{race}. No, the world revolves around the sun, what allowed it to live assnd support life. You adults realized that you're the earth and and you revolve around taking care of everyone and using your skills to make and sustain change. That's your sun. Teenagers like me are still reeling from the fact that we don't revolve around ourselves, that without help we can't live,  that someone's looking out for us, and we have to take care of ourselves to a certain degree to take care of others. Some of us aren't quite up to that yet. There's that disconnect, and it's found not only in needing to explain a point of praise/consolation to anyone of Gen Z, but also in perception of how the world had always been functioning, because not everybody knows that.  That's all I can say for certain for now. I just want everyone to know I'm reading their comments and learning from them, so thanks for the reading material. I'll be sure to tell my author sister all about this and she can include some of your points in a story she just might finish.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Crazy, Race & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}3/914 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.328 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Well I know that my family, and I'm speaking as a 17 year \textbf{old}, has always said that it makes people happy when you're early or on time and I like to make people smile. We are also a performance arts family so we're always told it makes you look better to bosses, I feel pressure about a bunch of things but this isn't one of them because my family made being on time seem normal\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}1/76 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.316 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Sparrow1315 hmm I am not English that's why my EN language isn't so well and I am a teen as I think 17 year \textbf{old} is called teen, also I understand, I was just sad cuz if she simply says hurry up I won't mind but she over say it (once she reached 10 times in less than 10min ),  that bothers me much I can't hurry up when I can not pay attention to what I do at all, I am sorry for annoying u by my problem, I was just kinda angry, I am sorry ...\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}1/98 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.02 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Aziz Quadri , they might have a point though, kids nowadays start watching Disney channel-( lots of teenager targeted TV shows) at an early \textbf{age} -7-8.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small That's because for some people (some women, in particular) adolescence started at \textbf{age} 10, others between 11 and 13.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small naly202 Disney channel isn't for teens. It's for kids and young teens. Shows for teens are like Riverdale and stuff.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Katelou Mathieson what's a "teem?" NO, adolescence starts at 13 and ends at 19. Teen years, ("teen" meaning "to add ten") don't begin until one turns 10 years \textbf{old} and ends when that same individual turns 19. That's why ages 10-12 years are considered "tween" or the misnomer "pre-teen".

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small People do get puberty at different ages. My eight year \textbf{old} cousin is going through puberty now. And my aunt went through it \textbf{age} seven.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Aziz Quadri Actually, most girls start puberty at 12 or 13, just like the boys. I started at 13.
