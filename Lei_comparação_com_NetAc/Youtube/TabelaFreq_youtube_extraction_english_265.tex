  \cellcolor{green!5}\small We, nations and all of humanity, can't manage to achieve our true high potentials, because of debt based economics of greed and iniquity of gross inequalities favoring the wealthy and those chosen to be their first line support such as real estate appraisers, wealth managers, and financial analysts where degrees, qualifications, hard work, and self presentation are not enough alone to prosper and thrive as in being allowed in a door of opportunity that leads to a fruitful career track. No country is a truly united democracy for psychopaths game the system only lusting for power and glory. An honest person with integrity and work \textbf{ethnic} can't really thrive unless fortunate to have a protected ascribed career position like taking on a family business or arranged to be in a position providing a service to their fathers business buddies. It we could ever be united and fair with equal justice and liberty for all with actual entrepreneurial spirited free market capitalism, then we could move forward and grow together for the most awesome journey through life together leaving a legacy of sustainability and tradition based on solid values. However, we don't have such a grand vision despite many individuals knowing the well heeled fake money based leaderships sell us all out so hideously short. We probably won't ever overcome the fundamental failures behind our shortcomings causing mass confusion, great anger, and chaos before the world is such a mess that world war ends up happening again.

Various homegrown organizations and movements participation in incidents of hate-crime is often overlooked or goes unreported.
