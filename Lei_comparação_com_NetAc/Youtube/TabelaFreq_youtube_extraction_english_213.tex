Native men have experienced genocide from their own \textbf{race}, but faced far worse when the European Hispanics came to the Western Hemisphere.  Native men, women and children have been slaughtered, wholesale, by the Hispanics up to the mid to late 19th century by the Mexican government who had a blood bounty on the Apache.  How about that 14th Amendment that gave all Blacks in America US Citizenship, has been Liberally contorted to provide false citizenship to children born to non-citizens, yet it did not grant US Citizenship to the Native Peoples of this Land till a special Act of Congress in 1924.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Racism is real.  It's also a business and political currency.   Does \textbf{racism} keep minorities from success---NO.   Do progressives inflate the racial divide to further their agenda--YES.  The facts are that America's founders, and those who want to conserve those founding ideas, always believed in liberty for everyone. "All men are created equal".  There were not a bunch of slave owners in Americas history.  The fact is 100 of them were democrat and most owned plantations in the south.  In the 1960's the democratic party changed their platform and realized that they were losing the \textbf{race} argument.  Instead they focused on getting votes using welfare programs and talking about justice.   In this way, the democrat still own slaves and republicans are still fighting for their freedom.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Race, Racism & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/125 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.4 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Oskar Ware I'm white myself but I think it is certainly necessary to pay reparations to \textbf{black} people after all the disgusting and horrible things white people have done and what's even worse, still keep doing today! It's wrong to say that what happened 100 years ago doesn't concern us. If the roles would be reversed then I'm sure all white people would be demanding reparations every day. \textbf{Black} people deserve justice and it's time for us whites to stop being \textbf{racist} bigots and accept responsibility.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/86 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.488 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small ProximityX In no way am I saying that slavery was a good thing, it's terrible, but if someone hasn't owned a slave, they can't be prosecuted. It's as simple as that. And even if the roles were reversed, I would understand that \textbf{black} people in the present day could not  help their past, so I would just get over it. We will never get anywhere by focusing on something that happened hundreds of years ago. And even so, what about the Arabic slave trade, where white Europeans where taken, sold and tortured. That was horrible, but I'm not demanding reparations! \textbf{Black} people were involved in that as well, their not demanding reparations from Muslims. If we're working of the logic that you imply, then people in modern day Germany will have to pay reparations to Jewish people, because some of their relatives may have worked in concentration camps.I'm British but I'm not demanding reparations from Nordic people and Italian people, seeing as the Vikings and the Romans invaded us.We should fight against \textbf{racism}, I'm not denying that, however demanding money from innocent people because of their \textbf{race}, because of their past (something that cannot be changed) is ridiculous. For crying out loud, it happened almost 200 years ago, around 6-7 generations ago, and it wasn't good, but we don't have to prosecute innocent white people for something that they didn't actually do. It's like a kids father robbing a bank, his father dies and the kid gets the blame.

"\textbf{Racism} is \textbf{racism}. That's it."However, I do appreciate that this video is better quality than many out there. In a country full of outrage right now, this video presents its message (true or not) in a generally peaceful, nonviolent, and reasonable manner. Thank you.

If a realtor dies not want to sell a \textbf{black} family into a specific neighborhood, perhaps they do not want to initiate white flight, because white families begin to experience thefts, rude inconsiderate behavior. \textbf{Sexual} deviance, drugs and traffic.

The blood I got, I'm not sure who it came from or what their \textbf{race} was, but I do know this: It was a compatible blood-type, and the heart didn't care that the person was \textbf{black}, white, or any color in-between. It had a job to do, and with that blood, it did that job, thus saving my life.

Things are getting better now, but, I'll give you one example, it's anecdotal but it's one example, I'm a pilot, soon to be an airline pilot. The first \textbf{black} airline pilot wasn't until 1964. Even to this day, in America, there are only less than 2 \textbf{black} pilots, even less for women pilots.

Blacks and others minorities have only had the opportunities for a few decades, as opposed to everyone else.  Which goes to a bigger institutional point. Yes, personal responsibility is very important, but it's rather ignorant to deny that some individuals due to institutional oppression that has lasted up until the last 50 years, didn't have affect on these said group's ability to succeed and excel.

The welfare state is a big problem, though \textbf{black} people don't benefit from it as much as white people.

Yeah it happened , yeah it was bad , but get over it and quit blaming every white for the transgressions of 5 , that is very very childish .Quit making excuses , graduate high school,  get a job and do not have children out of wedlock.

I think it's constant indoctrination from birth about how victimized they are today because some of them have ancestors that were slaves and they will never be successful because all whites conspire to keep them down because years ago 5 of whites owned slaves and the entire \textbf{race} needs to be punished, even the ones who owned no slaves , fought to free them and fought to pass laws and get an amendment to the constitution to ensure equal treatment. None of that matters , they all need to be punished because they,are white . Sorry we have heard this bs so long and done everything possible to present opportunity to you and it does no good .

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@suprmekai5 From the information I have been able to access , the police received a call of a young \textbf{black} male pointing a gun at people . This is all the two officers had to go on when they arrived on scene . The dispatcher fails to mention that the caller thought it was a bb gun 1st mistake . The police car pulls up to the gazebo and the officer exits the police car with his weapon drawn . Standard procedure for this situation . Regardless of whether the officers said it once or three times , anyone taught to comply with the police would drop the weapon . 2nd and most grievous mistake made by Tamir Rice . What everyone refuses to even consider is Tamir's parents complete failure to perform the basic requirements of parenting . First there is no such thing as a toy gun . Second removing every part that identifies it as a toy . Third not teaching basic gun handling procedure . Fourth allowing him out with a gun . Fifth failure to teach Tamir that you never point a weapon at anyone except in self defense . Sixth , failure to teach compliance with the police . So I can see firing the dispatcher , but the entire rest of the responsibility is on Tamir's parents . They should be locked up for endangering the life of a minor and negligent homicide for their sons death . Their failure as responsible parents was the only reason their son died .\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!5}1/258 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.388 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Read this HUGE post if you are not \textbf{racist}. tl;dr this video isn't helping anyone, it just helps some people believe that they are helping solve \textbf{racism}here are all the flaws of this video.1. They could have just given the \textbf{black} resumes to harder to obtain jobs when compared to the white resumes. They don't specify that they were given to the same employer, and if they did give to the same employer then the employer would have noticed it. Bad experiment integrity.2. Nowhere do they state that the same car is bought, or that the same dealer was used, or that the car was paid in full vs paid over time with interest accrued. Trash correlations.3. Of course \textbf{black} drivers are more likely to be pulled over, and here is why. First of all, think about what type of neighborhood you would most likely find a \textbf{black} driver. that's right, poor neighborhoods and that is also where crime happens the most. So logically you would find more pull overs near poor neighborhoods, and they just happen to be \textbf{black}. confounding variables everywhere.4. Remember 3, \textbf{black} people are poorer (its not their fault, its just a result of recovery from slavery+unfairlaws that takes time to heal). So they would immediately have less options based on their budget. It is never stated that the clients studied had the same budget ranges.5. \textbf{Black} people would be more likely arrested for weed because they are more likely to be pulled over or questioned because of the reasons I stated on 3. again, invalid correlation6.poor people are jailed more, that's known, again its not their fault blah blah blah.7. Better health care comes from more money, that easily explains that. again the same \textbf{black} people are poorer scenario.8. \textbf{Black} people would be less likely to contact WHITE legislators, this one is really easy to see the flaw in. This entire study is basically saying, "poor people get less benefits, what a surprise right?" it just happens to be that a lot of \textbf{black} people are poor, to solve this you don't go around making videos telling people that \textbf{racism} exists. To help in the cause you try to improve the USA economy so that poverty levels are reduced on all fronts.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}12/386 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.109 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Racism and prejudice are very obviously real (Though often incorrectly used interchangeably), progress is ever-steady yet still slow. All of them appear valid points, but many of them pretty blatantly leave out other contributing aspects that also factor in with \textbf{race} and create very obvious arguing points (Police more often than not cannot see someone's \textbf{race} before they pull them over, equal marijuana use but what led to each person getting caught, etc.). You've already convinced the people who agree with you, but using one-sided arguments isn't going to convince people who don't. Presenting the whole argument of  each topic with a brief synopsis, and acknowledging the other talking points while still emphasizing what can't be explained by anything other than \textbf{race} is what's going to convince rational people. Irrational people won't be convinced regardless. Sometimes people just have never had the full facts and statistics clearly presented to them and it's all they needed, but incomplete arguments aren't going to do that.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Racism is the lowest, most crudely primitive form of collectivism. It is the notion of ascribing moral, social or political significance to a man's genetic lineage—the notion that a man's intellectual and characterological traits are produced and transmitted by his internal body chemistry. Which means, in practice, that a man is to be judged, not by his own character and actions, but by the characters and actions of a collective of ancestors.\textbf{Racism} claims that the content of a man's mind (not his cognitive apparatus, but its content) is inherited; that a man's convictions, values and character are determined before he is born, by physical factors beyond his control. This is the caveman's version of the doctrine of innate ideas—or of inherited knowledge—which has been thoroughly refuted by philosophy and science. \textbf{Racism} is a doctrine of, by and for brutes. It is a barnyard or stock-farm version of collectivism, appropriate to a mentality that differentiates between various breeds of animals, but not between animals and men.Like every form of determinism, \textbf{racism} invalidates the specific attribute which distinguishes man from all other living species: his rational faculty. \textbf{Racism} negates two aspects of man's life: reason and choice, or mind and morality, replacing them with chemical predestination. -Ayn Rand\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Racism & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}5/207 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.415 \\  \hline

Although many of these studies are correct, some are one-sided and/or don't supply all the relevant information, for example: The study in New Jersey showed that more blacks were being pulled over not because they were \textbf{black} but because they were speeding a lot more than other races. A whole lot of studies only report facts that support a white on \textbf{black} \textbf{racist} narrative, it's sad but that's what makes money\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/98 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.061 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Sure, there will always be some statistics that are polled to look a certain way, just as liberal and conservative media does, but the issue stands that \textbf{racism} is still a huge issue in America today, and the media gives and takes to the situation.

The police force had 2 \textbf{black} members, and the rest were all white, and one left after the incident. \textbf{Race} riots don't happen because some kid gets shot in some big city, they happen after years of ignoring these issues, and sadly once the straw breaks the camels back, we love to report that, since it makes the headlines.

It's harder for them to move up the workplace totem pole and even sometimes get paid as much as others, for example my mom has tons of experience from many different workplaces, and they were going to recieve raises for ones who have a lot of specks, but she only got raised 25 cent and a young Caucasian girl that just came in and is actually ranked lower than my mom is getting paid more than her and she has nowhere near as much experience nor is her job as important as my moms. My brothers job got new management that fired him without giving him an appropriate reason and all of the other \textbf{black} people there, now there's only white people working that job.

My step dad was told by a doctor that he cannot work because of his lupus, but disability still denies him, so he has to work and every job he gets, he gets sick and loses that job for not being able to stay on it.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small +luvlycrazycooki3 I respect your point of view, however in such instances such as the example you provided of your mother's raise compared to that of a new employee that happened to be Caucasian in a lower position making more money. This is not an example that is \textbf{race} specific, new employees at many companies generally tend to start at a higher salary than long term employees, it's usually part of the negotiations that  occur during that person's talks as to whether or not they will accept employment with the employer. I have seen a lot of new employees start with more money where I work and they are incapable of performing their jobs as well as I perform mine. The example that you provided of your brother's termination due to a new manager is also not \textbf{race} specific. Many times when a company brings in new management, that management comes in with new views as to how things should be done and many times that comes with the decision to tear down the department and rebuild with new or fewer employees. The other examples that you provided of a sick friend being forced to work and your step dad who has lupus and can't get disability are also not examples of \textbf{racism}, this happens to white people as well. A white co-worker of mine a few years ago was diagnosed with Lou Garrets disease and due to her illness was not able to work most of the time, she was terminated. Another white co-worker of mine had rheumatoid arthritis and suffered crippling pain on a daily basis, she missed a few days a week due to her illness and was terminated.  My point is that before we can deem something as \textbf{racism}, we have to look at the whole picture not just what we choose to see and hear. Does \textbf{racism} exist? Yes it does. It exists in every \textbf{race} that walks this earth. What do we do about it?

If you think about that claim logically you have to consider the obvious question. Why are they paying higher interest rates? Are dealerships and financial institutions all across the \textbf{nation} \textbf{racist}? Highly unlikely. Or is it the simple fact that on average a person of color is less likely to negotiate the terms of the loan and not willing to walk away from the dealership and take their business elsewhere? Dealerships and financial institutes around the world are more than willing to take advantage of anyone willing to take a high interest loan. Is it \textbf{racism}?

According to Jensen, the SD for whites is 16 (18 for males and 14 for females) but is 10 or 11 (some say 14) for NE Asians and about 12 for blacks. 45 A group that has a larger SD will have both more geniuses and more dummies than another group that has the same mean but a smaller SD; white males have the largest SD, which may explain their greater achievements (see next chapter)."- proudly?  i didn't sense that, but u did?  u have some amazing cyber mind reading skills?  and continue on this childish need of wishing i was this dummie u want to debate - good luck with that... i scored 92 on the science section of our ACT, did u?   or maybe your 84 IQ \textbf{nation} doesn't have such high level tests for Ivy League and such...  were u a bio major like me?iqtest.com  take the test, lets compare results... did u graduate with honors?  did u beat 96 of entering juniors in college in math?  did u ace your last college math class?  i'm on the fast sloping downward right side of the bell curve, but u of course are flat lining, right?  mensa or better?  u in that top 2 grouping?  - the way i write?  my own fast hack style with some efficiencies built in... its MARGIN, i wouldn't make that mistake, unless typing fast enough...here is some schooling for u, a \textbf{racist} primer u need: [LINK] - u can get a free abridged version, which is how i got mine...

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Only white people can be Racists because of Systematic White Supremacy and where it is originally rooted from not that delusional dictionary that white folks use to deflect from the real definition of \textbf{racism}. Let me explain:'There is an element of whites who are \textbf{nothing} but cold, animalistic racists. That element is the one that controls or has strong influence in the power structure. It uses the press skillfully to feed statistics to the public to make it appear that the rate of crime in the \textbf{Black} community, or community of nonwhite people, is at such a high level. It gives the impression or the image that everyone in that community is criminal.'– Malcolm X, speech at the London School of Economics on Feb. 11, 1965\textbf{Black} people cannot be \textbf{racist}. We could possibly be prejudice, but the power dynamics of the system of white supremacy proves that \textbf{Black} people do not have the ability to oppress other races. Malcolm teaches that \textbf{racism} uses a system to oppress and hold power over a person based on their \textbf{race}.'In America, \textbf{racism} exists but racists are all gone. Racists belong to the past. Racists are the thin-lipped mean white people in the movies about the civil rights era. Here's the thing: the manifestation of \textbf{racism} has changed but the language has not. So if you haven't lynched somebody then you can't be called a \textbf{racist}. If you're not a bloodsucking monster, then you can't be called a \textbf{racist}. Somebody has to be able to say that racists are not monsters.'-Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, AmericanahAdichie cleverly states that 'racists belong to the past' because 21st century \textbf{racism} has evolved into a monster that appears to be nonexistent or undetectable.  When white people are able to sit in the same room with \textbf{Black} people without calling them 'n*ggers' then in the world's \textbf{racist} view that is progress.  The truth is that racists still exist, but they are able to hide behind so many things just not to appear \textbf{racist}.But this is what many ignorant white folks will try to do when it comes to the topic of \textbf{racism}:Try to Explain \textbf{Racism} to a \textbf{Black} Person...smhMany white people will be quick to refer to Webster's dictionary for a simplified explanation of \textbf{racism} in an attempt to blatantly ignore the fact that racial prejudices have to be coupled with the ability to oppress a certain community in order to be considered \textbf{racism}. The dictionary, obviously, provides an oversimplified explanation of what \textbf{racism} really is and, therefore, that definition should be the last thing white people reach for when they find themselves knee-deep in a conversation about \textbf{racism} in America.Or this is another thing white folks will say as well:Claim the Real Problem Is Class and Not \textbf{Race}...again smhWhile \textbf{classism} is certainly a serious issue in America, it isn't one that should take away from the fact that \textbf{racism} still plagues the \textbf{nation} and deserves to be at the forefront of national discussions. Even more important is the fact that people need to realize \textbf{classism} and \textbf{racism} are more connected than some white people believe. The negative impact of \textbf{racism} has worked for centuries to leave \textbf{Black} people in poverty. So, more often than not, those low-income communities are also the communities with the highest population of people of color.And this is one of the main stuff ignorant white people specifically will say: Claim They Can't Be \textbf{Racist} Because They're ‘Colorblind'...smh..smhBeing 'colorblind' is a problematic claim in and of itself because it negates the cultural values, norms, expectations and life experiences of people of color. Society should not try to combat \textbf{racism} by making ill attempts at ignoring \textbf{race}. Instead, people should acknowledge \textbf{race} and celebrate those cultural differences. If society continues to hide behind a 'colorblind' veil, the true issues of \textbf{racism} that plague the country will never truly be resolved.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Classism, Nation, Nothing, Race, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Nationality - General, Social Class - General & \cellcolor{green!5}35/657 & \cellcolor{green!5}5.327 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@John Patty sad so sad..you don't wanna listen to the truthful and factual information that I posted up..so indeed again you are a white supremacists..a foolish and ignorant at that. Examples and factual information on Institutional \textbf{Racism}:Google is your best friend...Go research: \textbf{Black}/White wealth gap, redlining, 'White flight,' subprime mortgages and \textbf{black} families,  discriminatory sentencing practices, occupational overcrowding, workplace discrimination, employment discrimination, mandatory minimum sentences and in-school segregation to start. Here are some highlights:The median wealth gap difference between a White family and a \textbf{Black} family is \$80,000.1 in 9 \textbf{Black} children has an incarcerated parent compared to 1 in 57 White children.A White man who has been to jail still more likely to get a job than a \textbf{Black} man who hasn't.Also take a look at this...\textbf{Black} people are the most vulnerable cogs in the wheel, and remain in a permanent state of crisis.  If \textbf{Black} people remain vulnerable, no one in America's so-called democracy is safe.  The problem is institutionalized \textbf{racism}, in a country which fails to acknowledge there is a crisis.  And yet, another study on a major American city sounds the alarm on the barriers facing \textbf{Black} people. This time it's \textbf{Black} men in Pittsburgh.The study from the Urban Institute is titled, 'Barriers \& Bridges: An Action Plan for Overcoming Obstacles and Unlocking Opportunities for \textbf{African} American Men in Pittsburgh.'  The 67-page report found that in the post-industrial economy in which Pittsburgh is thriving, based particularly on a shift from manufacturing to finance and health services, hiring practices that shut out people of color have kept \textbf{Black} men from economic opportunity.The Urban Institute Report focuses primarily on documenting the racial disparities between \textbf{Black} and white men in their access to jobs, financial services, and business development opportunities. It also identified structural barriers in the form of policies, practices, and norms that help maintain racial gaps.'Though economic disadvantage befalls people of all races and ages, young \textbf{African} American men have borne a disproportionate share of the burden of Pittsburgh's economic change,' the report's authors wrote. 'Although never fully equal, the well-paying manufacturing jobs that many \textbf{African} American men were able to secure with only a high school diploma (or sometimes less education) have virtually disappeared, leaving many men with few alternatives for adequately supporting a family.'According to the study, city leaders realize the need to change the way Pittsburgh does business, which contributes to the considerable racial disparities.  The city wants to attract more employers and industries, and suffers from a 'mid-level skills gap,' in which employees have been on the job for either 40 or more years, or less than five years.  Further, the city's interest in racial inclusion is driven by younger workers, who want to live in places that reflect America's racial and \textbf{ethnic} diversity.Intergenerational mobility was identified as a factor leading to racial exclusion, as unions kept out \textbf{African}-American workers, leaving \textbf{Black} children lacking in the resources their white peers receive to acquire the skills the new workforce demands.  \textbf{Black} men in particular, have suffered from structural barriers, including current institutional practices, geographic segregation, social isolation from critical networks, and economic and other accumulated disadvantages resulting from a lack of access to employment, education, and other opportunities.In Pittsburgh, the consequences of these barriers are clear.  \textbf{African}-American men are 11.4 percent of men ages 18 to 64 in the Pittsburgh region, yet they are a mere 5.4 percent of the region's adult male workforce.  The report also found that in many key industries, \textbf{Black} workers find themselves at the bottom of the pay scale.  Moreover, the report notes that 'Pittsburgh's \textbf{African} American men have historically and disproportionately faced unprecedented barriers to economic opportunities' among people living in the region. For \textbf{Black} men with at least a high school diploma, the unemployment rate between 2007 and 2011 was 12.2 percent, more than double that of whites (5.1 percent).  In addition, \textbf{Black} men are far more likely to live at or below the poverty level.'Structural barriers such as the expense of job training programs, online job applications (for men without easy access to a computer), and insufficient financial collateral to qualify for a business loan are very real for men who disproportionately struggle to make ends meet,' the report noted.'You have people who are disproportionately touched by the criminal justice system — sometimes unfairly — and they are disproportionately excluded from health care and other security-sensitive sectors,' Urban Institute fellow Margaret Simms told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.Simms called the city 'one of the most segregated metropolitan communities in the country,' split along historical racial divides that still shape neighborhoods, the workforce and professional and social networks.This latest study is but one of numerous reports that chronicle the impact of institutional \textbf{racism} on the well-being of \textbf{African}-Americans.  For example, a recent study found that in Baltimore, banks are cheating \textbf{Black} people out of mortgages based primarily on \textbf{race} rather than income.  Companies use the court system to pursue collection lawsuits to target \textbf{Black} communities and squeeze them financially.  Further, due to \textbf{race}-based predatory lending, \textbf{Black} homeowners lost wealth as whites gained wealth, cutting them out of the so-called American Dream.  The police financially exploit communities of color, as one Oklahoma study found that Blacks and other minorities accounted for two-thirds of the cash seizures by law enforcement.In addition, the racial disparities in health care are evident, as Blacks and Latinos receive lower quality care and are made to wait longer to see the doctor, and \textbf{Black} children are less likely to receive crucial pain medication than whites in the emergency room.The studies are endless, all with similarly disappointing and alarming findings.  The reports will continue to mount if America fails to address the fundamentals of systemic racial discrimination, and seek to eradicate them immediately.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}African, Black, Ethnic, Race, Racism & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}27/973 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.775 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@John Patty Lastly, When it comes to which \textbf{race} uses the most food stamps you say whites make up around 65 of America's population, and blacks around 13 which group of whites are you referring to? Whites use numbers to suit their need. If they want to be the majority, they include All Europeans, most Hispanics, most Asians, and all islanders of the pacific . When they want to talk about being supreme, they only include Europeans. So just who is white people?Also the percentage of whites and blacks are actually almost about even.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@krzeselko Again...\textbf{Racism}, at its very root, is a system of supremacy — white supremacy. Not all white people are racists. But we're talking about a system, not individuals.First and foremost, \textbf{racism} historically and continually uses whiteness and proximity to whiteness as a means to control resources and access to institutional and social power in American society, often at the expense of Blacks and people of color.Even when whiteness intersects with other marginalized social categories such as class, sexuality, \textbf{gender}, ability and \textbf{nationality}, white identity and perceived whiteness (via whiter-looking skin) often affords an individual a better chance of moving through life much easier than their counterparts.\textbf{Black} people cannot be \textbf{racist}. We could possibly be prejudice, but the power dynamics of the system of white supremacy proves that \textbf{Black} people do not have the ability to oppress other races. Malcolm teaches that \textbf{racism} uses a system to oppress and hold power over a person based on their \textbf{race}.Many white people will be quick to refer to Webster's dictionary for a simplified explanation of \textbf{racism} in an attempt to blatantly ignore the fact that racial prejudices have to be coupled with the ability to oppress a certain community in order to be considered \textbf{racism}. The dictionary, obviously, provides an oversimplified explanation of what \textbf{racism} really is and, therefore, that definition should be the last thing white people reach for when they find themselves knee-deep in a conversation about \textbf{racism} in America.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Gender, Nationality, Race, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}13/243 & \cellcolor{green!5}5.35 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@krzeselko Also not just America but \textbf{racism} is people who have systematic power which are people who are white or people who look close to white by having lighter skin then their dark counterparts. Places like India, China, Japan, Latin America, Middle East and etc.. Have a system that value and treat lighter skin people who are closer to white better then dark skin people who they value less and keep at the bottom of the ladder in their society. This is a concept that is based off of European \textbf{racism} toward blacks that other races and \textbf{ethnic} groups take inspirations from to oppress melanoid people globally.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnic, Racism & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/107 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.804 \\  \hline

So again Most slaves were imported from other British colonies and the Americas.Slave trade that white folks created was based on skin color, superiority and inferiority! They treated their slaves inhumanely or like animals just because of their white supremacists ideology over people who were \textbf{black} that look different from them!Now every country all across the globe throughout history had slavery of some sort where warrior tribes took enemy tribe warriors and made them prisoners of war. But the thing was it wasn't based on skin color! It was based on enemy tribes going to war with each other which can be dated back to the beginning of time! White folks made slavery about you are \textbf{black} so you are inferior and you will be treated like an animal or worse then a animal.

"Experience" with an illness, in the Medicine, doesn't mean being inflicted with an illness; it means having experience DEALING with that illness.Your original comment was an assertion in which you tried to tell \textbf{Black} people what they were feeling and what their problems were, as if you somehow have your life sorted out and are the omniscient and omnipresent messiah of the \textbf{Black} \textbf{race}.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I'm gonna hit EVERY "\textbf{racism}" in the video, and debunk them all... 1) They claim \textbf{black} sounding names are less likely to be hired than white sounding names. This is not \textbf{race} discrimination. It is name discrimination. My aunt is a white hippie, and named her children "Star" "Moon Beam" and "Flower". All of her children had trouble getting jobs because of their names in spite of them being white. If she named her kids Sally, James, and Kelly they would be more "Hire-able". When a \textbf{black} mother names her children Le-a, Tyrone, and Jamal instead of Larry, Tyler, and Jeffery same deal.  Don't name your kids something stupid if you want them to get a job one day. 2) \textbf{Black} people are charged roughly 700 dollars more for an automobile. Interesting phenomenon. However \textbf{black} people are charged the same when they have to pay a phone bill, or go to McDonalds, or get a gallon of gas? Interesting. I would not attribute prices on cars being more for blacks to \textbf{racism}. That is simply weaker bargaining skills among \textbf{black} people as a whole than white people. A \textbf{black} person is capable of getting a reduced price on an auto the same way a white person can, they just gotta learn to bargain better.  3) \textbf{Black} drivers are twice as likely to be pulled over. \textbf{Black} people commit more traffic violations? Where is the \textbf{racism} I don't get it? 4) \textbf{Black} clients are shown 17.7 fewer homes that are for sale. Again this echo's back to my previous statement. \textbf{Black} people are not as good at bargaining skills. All this means is the \textbf{black} couple are happy after the fourth house they saw for sale, and the white couple is happy after the fifth house they saw. It's not \textbf{racism} at all. 5) Equal marijuana use yet blacks are 4 times more likely to be arrested for it. I don't know how they figured out usage being equal on that one. It is a crime to smoke weed... were they taking a survey asking who breaks the law expecting honest answers? Okay Lets just say it is roughly equal usage, and blacks are about 4 times as likely to be caught smoking weed... I'm gonna tell you a story about this one. When I was in high school I smoked a bit of weed myself. I would always smoke it at home with just one or two friends. I would clean up any weed, and hide it well. I would blow my smoke into a drier sheet inside a paper towel roll to get rid of the smell... A \textbf{black} guy I knew would just sit on his porch, or drive in his car smoking weed! He was \textbf{black} and more OPEN ABOUT SMOKING and thus he was eventually arrested where I never was. That's not \textbf{racism}! That is just him being stupid about it, and me getting away with it because I was more clever about it. 6) \textbf{Black} people are 6 times more likely to do prison time. Okay lets look at that from a different angle. Women commit far less rapes than men do. A lot less often. Yet many more men are in prison for rape than women. The rate of crime is higher among that demographic so the rate of incarceration reflects it. 7) \textbf{Doctors} did not inform blacks as often as whites about the importance of a certain heart procedure. This is simply misinformation. Any doctor that would admit to doing this would lose his license for malpractice. 8) legislatures respond less frequently to \textbf{black} sounding names. See point 1... same exact argument. 9) Finally they ask if this is not \textbf{racism} then what is. I'll tell you what \textbf{racism} is. \textbf{Racism} is treating \textbf{racism} as if it is a 1 way street. \textbf{Racism} does not only happen to \textbf{black} people. White people can experience \textbf{racism}. So can \textbf{black} people. So can asians. So can latinos or any other \textbf{race} you can think of. The real \textbf{racism} here is when you make the ignorant portion of the \textbf{black} community, and the liberal white guilt portion of the white community come together and collectively look at blacks as a "victim" and whites as a "criminal" together painting white people in a bad light.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small White Supremacist never ceases to amaze me. I hear them all the time saying how this country needs God, but turns around and degrade people. Let me start with Homosexuality. White Supremacist absolutely flipped out when same-sex marriage was legalized and in my opinion coming from a Christian, I think people just need to mind their own business. It's not our place to play God, so let people be and just YOU as a person worry about being a good Christian. If most really read the Bible then they would know refusing to work with each other is a sin. Judging people is a sin, and they do all of that. Some mention how Gays molest children, when a lot of them do it themselves and then want to run to God and ask for "forgiveness" when caught. Next, \textbf{Racism}. Never think for one minute that because your skin is white that your right and everything else is not. Stop saying \textbf{black} people need to address \textbf{black} on \textbf{black} crime because some white people can't even address white on white crime. Atleast people of color create programs in hopes to bring people together and to bring awareness to certain things while some white people rather sit at home and be keyboard warriors. Everyone is beautiful, talented, educated, worth something, but unfortunately some people are not as lucky as others to be told them things or have the means to accomplish their dreams. The real people who's destroying this world are people who's feeding into mindless white supremacists who are trying to provoke a \textbf{race} war, but don't be fools and give them what they want, especially when we are coming so far as a \textbf{nation}, don't give in.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small It's called culturism. Stop being associated with an ignorant, violent, sympathy seeking culture and you'll be A+ ok!I'd love to see this same comparison with Asians vs. Blacks, etc.You'd see the exact results.Why?Because Asian culture is associated with numerous positive attributes. Intelligence, hard work, etc. It's even an accurate stereotype when you look at their academic performance. Their music reflects this, their food, their countries of origin. Asians are less likely to ask for hand outs, less likely to be on well fare. They are more likely to be business owners and have college degrees, etc. It goes and on.\textbf{Black} culture is associated with sports, hip hop, violence. They aren't looked at as hard workers. When you look at the stereotype it also fits. In the academic realms blacks do worse than Asians and whites. Hold jobs for shorter periods of time (or not at all) and it all reflects in their music, their food and again their countries of origin. Blacks are also noted as being the primary \textbf{race} to ask for help, hand outs or to get well fare. This is also reflected in the numerous "social programs" to exclusively help blacks that leave whites, Asians and Mexicans out in the cold because apparently it's only blacks that need "special help"....So yeah.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small And now for something completely different... Which is the truth. \textbf{Racism} exists, it's easy to define. I believe it usually comes from a variety of self-hatred issues. Personally, I like diversity, I like the fact that this planet is home for everyone with all diverse cultures. Everyone can find something for themselves. Now here's an interesting scientific fact, I read in an issue of "The World of Science" about a prediction that in a 1000 years or longer human \textbf{race} will evolve in a way that we will all have more or less unified skin tone and that will be beige or olive beige (which is \textbf{nothing} less than returning to our supposed origins of the first developed civilizations "the white man" comes from).There is no "white holocaust", it's just a fact that it can eventually happen. Till then, we may even colonize a few other places in space. This is why I think regular \textbf{race} wars are simply moronic.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small It helps when white people engage other white people on the subject of \textbf{racism}. Being outspoken about these issues is important for propagating positive anti-\textbf{racist} values through your circles of friends etc. However, sometimes that will fail, and you won't be able to change some people's minds. Up to you to decide if you want to remain their friends. How strong are your morals?The best thing for fixing \textbf{racism} is actually an attitude of indifference towards races, as opposed to an attitude of strong recognition of injustice (even though that's counter-intuitive). The problem with the second thing, is that it keeps bringing \textbf{race} into focus as if it's something that matters - when in reality, it doesn't. \textbf{Race} should not matter for any situation, period. That's the logical stance. Making people into victims will actually always generate some backlash - this is a \textbf{weird} psychological thing that's part of human nature on larger scales.If a person is \textbf{racist}, the best kind of social pressure towards them should be along the lines of: "What the hell? Why does that even matter? Why you do care? Don't you have anything better to do? You're messed up." As opposed to: "You clearly don't understand what kinds of daily hardships they're going through."tl;dr - stop giving a sh*t about races, you're messed up\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Race, Racism, Racist, Weird & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}6/222 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.703 \\  \hline

No not all "Americans" are privileged. Some live in worse conditions than people in Africa depending on where you are. Try heading to Mississippi or Detroit. Just because you don't really know what Africa is about, doesn't mean I don't. They only show the worst parts of Africa on TV. Just like they want us to believe It's the same size as America when you could actually fit 3 or 4 America's in Africa. It's a big lie to keep people complacent, while they rape it.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Well the difference between Chattel Slavery and other forms, is that what whites did was so egregious they had to distinguish it from others forms. In American slavery they considered blacks not human or cattle. Property. When you take a person's or people's humanity away, you're open to do anything to them. In other forms of slavery they didn't try to say U weren't human; just that you owed in some way or lost a war. At some point you were able to get your humanity back. I like the way Immortal Tech put it. He said if whites would've just said "look you just lost the war. That's why we took you. We where stronger than you so we took you. Now that it's over we can return to life as usual." But because of how bad the things they did were, they had to consider us inhuman so it didn't feel or look so bad. That's why \textbf{racism} in this country is so prevalent even today.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Bishop Vidal Well, I've said it before but I guess I'll say it one more time. I'd be happy to go back to Africa. If you're willing to pull all whites out of that continent and leave us alone, I think that would be an awesome idea. The "You wouldn't last" argument only stands because of the destabilization efforts that have been ongoing for hundreds of years now. How can Africa ever get herself on her feet when whites effectively manipulate the region  as to control the resources? You do the same thing there that you do here. Pump drugs and weapons into areas, pick a side and sit back and watch the carnage. Then you put the results on live TV and say "see, look at the animals. They can't even get along." At some point throughout white's genetic development you learned how to manipulate on an astronomic level. It must have been all that time in cold climates that gave you that ability. All that time in the cold, fending for scraps and turning on your own that produced such an outstanding manipulative capacity. What's wrong with Blacks running Africa and selling you the resources you need? It's not like you want to do the actual work. You can't really survive in the climate without actual help anyway. Why not let us take things over and sell you what you need? We could have a real working relationship here. Humans are specialized for certain environments. Why not create a world wide equilibrium that benefits all? Why not truly work together, instead of fearing one \textbf{race} might take all. We all know each other now. We have no cut cards. Lets work together and move past this planet? I know the things I'm saying could never happen tho because your hate for blacks far extends resources and land. It's personal. You hate \textbf{black} men specifically because of how your females feel about us. As Sigmund Freud said "It's all about \textbf{sex}." White men are scared of genetic annihilation.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The problem with these types of videos that create \textbf{Racism} and Hate are that they don't take into effect demographics. You send out 100 resumes. So what? They can be the same but you don't send them to the same person. Thus just because one person responds to a white resume it does not mean they would not have responded to the exact same resume by the \textbf{black} name. Same goes the other way around. A so called study like this does not count as the jobs can't all be the same, the person going through the resume is not the same etc. Thus it's totally random.Blacks get pulled over more often or get arrested more often for drugs. Again, whats the demographic for these events? Some places have more crime, areas with more crime are predominately \textbf{black} areas. Thus you can understand the more \textbf{common} pulling over and arrests. Also you have to look into the backgrounds of those being pulled over. A young white kid with NO RECORD is much less likely to be arrested for Pot than a young \textbf{black} with a record. Simple \textbf{common} sense.What a lot of you fools call \textbf{Racism} is simply Stereotypes. Having a stereotype is not the same as being a \textbf{racist}. You also need to look at the definition of a \textbf{racist}. Not many true racists alive today. There are some but not many. What most people have is stereotypes these days. They don't apply to all that is true but they are BASED ON TRUTH and EXPERIENCE in their creation. Thus it has been done enough and witnessed enough to create the stereotype. Example = Not all Asians drive bad but enough of them sure do to create the stereotype. Don't believe me? Come drive in SF sometime.Stereotypes exist and will until the end of time. Everyone has them and everyone believes in them. They are true to a degree and as mentioned above they are created by experience. Having them does not make you a \textbf{racist}. Simply put if you stick your hand into a fence 20 times and the dog on the other side bites your hand on the 21st time. Then next time you see a dog (any dog) on the other side of the fence you are going to be very cautions before you even try to stick your hand into the fence. Does that mean you hate all dogs? Does that make you a \textbf{racist} against dogs? No, it simply means based on a stereotypes and profiling you know there is a chance (however slight) that you MIGHT get bit thus you are a cautions.Life works the same way. We see stuff of TV, we witness stuff in real life, we hear things and thus it create stereotypes and profiles by which we live our lives. That is NOT \textbf{racism}.See how that works?

Coupled with the disparity in employment, and consequently income, non-whites and whites engage in criminal activity at identical rates when adjusted for economic status.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Barack says we need to have a conversation about \textbf{race} in America .. Fair enough. But this time, it has to be a two-way conversation.. White America needs to be heard from, not just lectured to.... This time, the Silent Majority needs to have its convictions, grievances and demands heard. And among them are these:First, America has been the best country on earth for \textbf{black} folks. It was here that 600,000 \textbf{black} people, brought from Africa in slave ships, grew into a community of 40 million, were introduced to Christian salvation, and reached the greatest levels of freedom and prosperity blacks have ever known.. Jeremiah Wright ought to go down on his knees and thank God he is an American.Second, no people anywhere has done more to lift up blacks than white Americans. Untold trillions have been spent since the '60s on welfare, food stamps, rent supplements, Section 8 housing, Pell grants, student loans, legal services, Medicaid, Earned Income Tax Credits and poverty programs designed to bring the African-American community into the mainstream. Governments, businesses and colleges have engaged in discrimination against white folks -- with affirmative action, contract set-asides and quotas -- to advance \textbf{black} applicants over white applicants. Churches, foundations, civic groups, schools and individuals all over America have donated their time and money to support soup kitchens, adult education, day care, retirement and nursing homes for blacks.We hear the grievances. Where is the gratitude??Barack talks about new 'ladders of opportunity' for blacks. Let him go to Altoona ? And Johnstown, and ask the white kids in Catholic schools how many were visited lately by Ivy League recruiters handing out scholarships for 'deserving' white kids...? Is white America really responsible for the fact that the crime and incarceration rates for African-Americans are seven times those of white America ? Is it really white America 's fault that illegitimacy in the African-American community has hit 70 percent and the \textbf{black} dropout rate from high schools in some cities has reached 50 percent?Is that the fault of white America or, first and foremost, a failure of the \textbf{black} community itself?As for \textbf{racism}, its ugliest manifestation is in interracial crime, and especially interracial crimes of violence. Is Barack Obama aware that while white criminals choose \textbf{black} victims 3 percent of the time, \textbf{black} criminals choose white victims 45 percent of the time?Is Barack aware that \textbf{black}-on-white rapes are 100 times more \textbf{common} than the reverse, that \textbf{black}-on-white robberies were 139 times as \textbf{common} in the first three years of this decade as the reverse?We have all heard ad nauseam from the Rev.

But about the epidemic of \textbf{black} assaults on whites that are real, we hear \textbf{nothing}.Sorry, Barack, some of us have heard it all before, about 40 years and 40 trillion tax dollars ago.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@daobesebeast Actually the most prosperous of blacks nations would be the Mali empire led by AbuBakari and Mansa Musa in 1280 AD.   Some would say Egypt is the most prosperous of \textbf{black} civilizations depending on how you define "\textbf{black}" While Trillions may have been spent it is notable that blacks in America have been paying taxes since they have existed and there's that elephant in the room of unpaid slave labor.  Also the 14th Amendment would disallow any racial preference via the  equal protection clause, therefore we really cannot consider it a direct benefit to blacks and numerically more whites are on assistance than blacks. I don't think anyone is blaming white america for the problems of \textbf{Racism}.  In fact white america very little power other groups.  They are more beneficiaries of the system rather than the controllers.  \textbf{Racism} is a system of control by a powerful group of people to limit or award access to resources in every institution.  This is not something that white america controls but rather benefits from.  Thus I'm not blaming white people for mass incarceration. It just so happens that the people that created the laws that they new would be applied unjustly where white. It's perfectly plausible that the same laws could be created by a group that contains other races as well. Why would a white criminal choose a \textbf{black} victim at the same rate?   The majority of crime is economics based.  So the incredulity of a white (who is amongst the wealthiest group) singling out a \textbf{black} (who is of the poorest group economically) for a crime doesn't make sense and the numbers bear this out . Rape - the question isn't whether rapes are happening more by a certain segment.  The question is "are we prosecuting ALL makes that are sexually assaulting women?"   judging by the new trend of women carrying the mattresses they were assaulted with on campus I'd say that most rape goes unreported and that white males are under-prosecuted.How was Jena a hoax?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small This the behavior of white people...!!!The sociopath doesn't think like you doWhat you see as important, is not of great importance to the sociopath. Firstly, sociopaths see life as a game and you the victim are just a player in the game of life. They see others, quite literally as ‘fair game'. By trying to seek revenge, in the sociopaths mind, you are being a willing player in the game. You are continuing to play the game with him/her. The sociopath won't mind this, as quite simply they ‘don't care'. They don't really care about anything except themselves and their own selfish needs. if they fake that they do care, this is usually only to get something for themselves.In the sociopath's mind, if you are going to try to exact revenge, then you are becoming a willing participant to:BlamingFramingShamingThese are the three things that the sociopath will do, should you try to exact revenge. And this is the reason why it is a waste of energy, and will only serve to bring further problems into your life.Firstly the sociopath will turn the situation around and blame you. If it is evident that you have done \textbf{nothing} wrong, don't be fooled into thinking that because you have done \textbf{nothing} wrong, then the sociopath will be exposed and you look like the ‘good guy', it doesn't work like that in the mind of the sociopath. Next stop is Framing, if they cannot effectively blame you – well then they will frame you. You already know that sociopaths are compulsive pathological liars, manipulative and deceptive.After blaming and framing comes shaming. This is where the sociopath will use everything that they learned about you in the assessment stage, all of your weaknesses to humiliate you and make you feel shame.At this point, things are getting much worse for you. If the sociopath owes you money, realistically you are better off writing the money off. As although the sociopath might promise to give you back what they owe you, they will simply use this as a way to extend the game, and stall for time, make excuses. All any interaction with the sociopath does, is to establish you as a player in the game, and also a willing victim for further abuse. To them, you are simply playing the game. This is something that they enjoy.Taking revenge rarely worksRevenge on the sociopath will rarely work becauseThey don't careThey are pathological liars and will turn it around on you, using blaming, framing and shamingThey don't worry about the future, what is important is right now. They have a lack of long term goalsThey see life as a game, and you the victim are just a willing player in the gameThey like to win and retain control and will do just about anything to achieve thisThey like to play victim, and can use the contact to lure you back in, for a further round of abuse (and will do, if they think that you are useful for further source of supply)What is the best way to get revenge?The best revenge is living well. By establishing no contact, and getting on with your life as if you do not need the sociopath. Even if your heart is breaking, focus on you, and your life, do not waste your energy focusing on the sociopath, and the sociopaths life. It will only bring more negativity into your life.Positivity attracts positivity. So attract positive things into your life. By focusing on what the sociopath owes you, or trying to get revenge, you  are focusing on negative energy, and this will only bring further negativity into your life.By focusing on you, and your own life, bringing things into your life that are positive, you will bring into your world, more than you had lost with the sociopath, much more than what the sociopath owes you. Its a win win situation for you.Establish No ContactFocus on youRealise that you will not recover losses from the sociopath,  but that you can recover personal losses in your life, by focusing on you and your lifeBe around people that you trust, that bring out the best in you, people that make you feel good around you. If there is \textbf{nobody}, then learn to love your own company, remember what peace there is in silenceTry to do one thing each day that makes you smile, even if that is going for a walk and admiring the beauty  in the world, that is natureCatch up with other losses, friends, family, rebuild your home, your lifeRebuild your life – without the sociopathRevenge on the sociopath is wasted energy. It will get you nowhere, and will only encourage the sociopath to play the game further with you.If you do get tempted…. please remember those three wordsBlamingFramingShamingThis is all that you will attract back towards you. Little else (unless the sociopath has committed an illegal offence that can absolutely be proven) – in this circumstance, call the police, do not deal with it yourself. Remove yourself from the game. Refuse to play the game.Establish No contact today, and start focusing on you.

I shouldn't have to be worried about walking down the street without getting jumped, I shouldn't have to worry about getting shot in a patrol car because I'm white.

But this path was set a long time ago when somehow the idea to fight \textbf{patriarchy} was a good dose of feminism and the ejection of the father from the home in lieu of a Gov check. I grew up in mostly a single parent household until the end of Jr High.   My step-father stepped up and gave me a precious 5 years of  "what a man does".   I don't really give a GD about appeasing  a particular groups feelings.   Boys need a father figure during the \textbf{transition} from pre-teen to young adult or for many it's game over. I feared my step-father much more than my mother.   He also was a police officer for about 4 years and he told me how he couldn't get over the fact that his life was in danger every night and this is coming from a military guy that did overseas deployments.   Police Officers have a very unique job that is highly stressful .

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Obsidian SeventyOneHello Obsidian. I understand what you are saying. The problem is, every statement you made here is difficult to back up opinion, at best, and, at worst, is factually false. The idea that \textbf{racism} only occurs from "privilege", "status" or "institutions" is a THEORY, mostly propagated by racists, to justify their own \textbf{racism}. Definitions absolutely matter. Please google "\textbf{racism} def". Out of the 4 dictionary results that come up for me, only one result even implies \textbf{racist} governmental institutions as a possible, secondary supplementary definition AND not one even mentions the words "privilege", "status" or "institutionalized". I am not saying that you believe the following, but, the belief that the accepted definition of \textbf{racism} is insufficient because it was written or influenced by whites, is, ironically, \textbf{racist}. Your prejudiced assumptions about what I "am hoping for" are prejudicial and false. \textbf{Racism} is clearly defined and your description of \textbf{racism} is factually wrong. Even if one assumes your statements are correct, you would still have to agree that this video is is discriminatory in its solely portraying whites as discriminatory and blacks as victims of discrimination. Don't get me wrong, my friend. \textbf{Racism} is absolutely a problem and does not make any sense. Please understand the irony in addressing the harm and unfairness of \textbf{racism} while simultaneously limiting the scope of the discussion to the \textbf{race} of those affected.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Race, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}11/230 & \cellcolor{green!5}4.783 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small First I would like to say that this video brings up many disturbing tends that exist within the United States. \textbf{Racism} is illogical and therefore should be done away with. \textbf{Racism} is also pervasive and has never been truly eliminated in any society ever. We humans will always do that which benefits us. So I propose we solve the problem like an economist solves problems. We find the trends, we investigate those trends, and we conclude rational decisions. If \textbf{racism} is so pervasive, we must ask why. Now I'm going to piss off a bunch of SJW's here, and that's okay with me ;) Most people know \textbf{racism} is wrong, most people don't admit to being \textbf{racist}, yet people act \textbf{racist}. Look at the statistics, and realize people are often unaware or unwilling to admit if they are secretly \textbf{racist}. This isn't a justification, its a trend, lets ask ourselves why. Has morality, or the "right thing to do" ever really steered people away from behaviors they wanted to engage in? I don't think so (think to the number of people who claim each other to be immoral) and if you're willing to accept that premise then we can conclude there is something confounding causing the issue.Telling people that \textbf{racism} is unethical, useless, wrong, immoral, illegal or stupid doesn't seem to convince people to give up that bad habit. Why is that? This is another trend.Educating them from a young \textbf{age} seems to make people more tolerant, yet in the end they still fall into those same bad habits, albeit much less publicly. Why is that?Are there any other behaviors we could associate with a population that mimics \textbf{racism}? I believe there are several, chiefly \textbf{nationalism}, class-ism, affiliations to political parties, ect. People can be moved to great emotion and illogical behavior by these stark divides. Another trend.I could keep going but I want to postulate this. If we start attacking this problem online, and start discussing with one another constructively the things we think, we as a democracy might be able to formulate a solution that our children can finally enjoy. Instead we feed trolls, point fingers, call names, bog ourselves down in conjecture and commit logical fallacies, all to feed an internal need of ego. Why is that? I think the Internet is this country's only real shot at fixing this problem. Schools won't or can't. Government won't or can't. Businesses don't bother trying much at all. We can though. We can debate, discuss and problem solve together and make a difference.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small So in other words, if cops pull over 50 \textbf{black} people they HAVE to pull over 50 white people too in order to seem fair? The prison thing is ridiculous too. Everyone there was found guilty in a court of law and many of them by a jury of their peers. It wasn't just, white cop sees \textbf{black} man with a hoody and throws him in prison for 25 to life......The assumptions made by these claims are too simplistic and ignore too many other factors as to WHY they are that way. I am not denying that \textbf{racism} exists. OKAY? okay. There will always be \textbf{racist} people of all races. Here's the thing, I'm willing to confront white \textbf{racism} (as a white) head on. Anyone who demeans blacks in front of me based solely on their \textbf{race} will get an ass chewing, but I expect the \textbf{black} community to step up and look at the problems within their own communities and \textbf{race} as well and why so many \textbf{black} kids never make it through school, have fatherless homes, use drugs, glorify "thug life" mentality. Being born poor for example, is NOT an excuse for staying poor and committing crimes. By the way yes i can talk about these issues because we all live in the same country and communities. It's a shared problem. Here is a thing, can I walk into a restaurant full of only white people and start talking out loud using the N word and degrading blacks and blaming them for everything? NO. I would either be kicked out or have my ass kicked, maybe both. At the very very least i would get scowls from people and they would not associate with me. In other words, in the majority of white culture it is WRONG to be \textbf{racist}, and calling me a \textbf{racist} because I'm white is insulting to me and is \textbf{racist} itself. Are there poor whites sitting in their trailers smoking crack and committing crimes? ABSOLUTELY! No one is arguing that only one \textbf{race} is capable of committing crime. The problem is that the reason more blacks are in prison is not because of \textbf{racism}, but because of the epidemic of crime, poverty and lack of education in \textbf{black} communities. UNTIL THAT IS FIXED this problem will continue on and on and on. I don't mind people talking openly about \textbf{racism}. It does still exist. But what I do mind, is when people distort facts or make generalizations about things without digging any deeper. I also hate when we can't have an honest discussion about the plague of problems within many areas of \textbf{black} communities that hold back their own success, which is in turn blamed on whites.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small You are completely oblivious to the issues! Here is an example to demonstrate how how the odds are stacked against \textbf{black} and brown people, and more specifically \textbf{black} and brown men: i went to a party in the hollywood hills. The houses were beautiful, predominantly an affluent white neighborhood. Pretty much everyone was doing coke, or ecstasy, or whatever. People were smoking weed right on the front lawn. I never once saw a police car drive by, because no one had called them. If you go to an urban, lower income neighborhood, predominantly \textbf{black} and brown, the police drive by almost every hour. They are always there, policing. \textbf{Black} and white people use marijuana at the same rate, but \textbf{black} people are 6 times as likely to be arrested for possession. When it comes to other drugs like coke, 14 of users are \textbf{black} and 70 are white, yet blacks make up 80 of arrests for possession. \textbf{Black} people arent more dangerous or more inclined to criminal behavior, they are just perceived to be because of racial bias, and media images of \textbf{black} men on tv in handcuffs, and the cultural narrative surrounding the \textbf{black} and brown experience only help to perpetuate these prejudices.

I really don't give a shit about how \textbf{black} people experience the world. It's their problem. At the end of the day I get to be white and enjoy all the perks of being white and that's fine by me. There was a time when I genuinely sought open dialogue and even parroted all of the left-wing talking points regarding \textbf{race}. But the response always seemed to be that anything short of hanging my head in shame and begging forgiveness for all of my supposed transgressions meant that I simply didn't get it. So fine, have it your way, but the movement for racial equality is hemorrhaging potential white allies because the \textbf{black} blame machine points in only one, very tired direction. I ride public transportation in NYC every day. And every day I have to share space with young \textbf{black} people who behave like subhumans (I'm choosing my words carefully and deliberately here) because they were raised and socialized by their grandmothers' TV sets. Mom is working and dad is nowhere to be found. My sister does taxes for ghetto dwellers and my brother is a union laborer who fixes elevators in the projects. The dozens and dozens of stories they have about the way \textbf{black} people live their lives has absolutely no equivalent among any other \textbf{race}. There isn't a comparison that can be made. Until those behaviors and life choices are factored into why white people have the views and opinions that they have of \textbf{black} people then no honest discussion can ever take place. I don't expect taking responsibility for one's own actions and life choices to suddenly develop within the \textbf{black} community any time soon (judging by the epidemic of fatherless and parentless children, it's clearly not in their wheelhouse) and as such I have relinquished any desire to take part in the discussion. In the meantime I'll be over here being white and going to parties where people are capable of having a good time without someone getting shot; paying for my kids' education and a mortgage instead of jewelry and a Benz while I live in section 8 housing; settling for an earnest apology when someone steps on my shoe instead of letting it devolve into a fistfight; listening to music on my iPhone with actual headphones on; speaking to the person next to me at a reasonable volume; tipping my waitress for a job well done and any of a million other wacky things that white people do.

Or, are there more relevant and compelling factors to be considered in forming an opinion and drawing any legal conclusion about this \textbf{woman}'s "allegations" (specifically, that she did not, on the occasion in question, agree to have \textbf{sex} with the defendant)?WHITE PEOPLE BEHAVING BADLY: A CONDENSED HISTORYWhen white Europeans packed enslaved \textbf{black} Africans into the bellies of their ships and sent these enslaved \textbf{black} people thousands of miles across the ocean to a future of misery in the "land of the free" this occurred for what reason?When the lives of \textbf{black} people were being quantified by those most enlightened of white men (the floundering fathers who wrote the American Constitution) as somehow being invested with three-fifths the value of a white life is this in any way indicative of the moral putrescence already at work in the hearts of those seeking to build a new \textbf{nation}?\textbf{Black} people were relegated to the status of three-fifths a human for precisely what reason?When Martin Luther King Jr. took a bullet to his face on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel it was for what reason, again?When \textbf{black} men, and \textbf{black} women were being knocked senseless by the clubs and batons of white Alabama State Troopers on the Edmund Pettis bridge in 1965 this was done on account of what?When \textbf{black} Americans travelling throughout the southern United States were refused accommodation by white owners of motels and hotels, and when these \textbf{black} people were then forced to sleep in their cars - and the only toilet to be found on such occasions was a bush -  this moral affront to basic human dignity occurred for what reason?When \textbf{black} men were being lynched by the ‘superior \textbf{race}' and \textbf{black} women were being raped by ‘massa' (Thomas Jefferson et al.) it was for what reason, remind me?When nine \textbf{black} high school students (the so-called "Little Rock Nine") required no less than the 101st Airborne Division of the U.S. Army in order to ... wait for it ... attend the same high school as white students these \textbf{black} high school students were spat upon by grown white women and grown white men because they had done what, precisely, to white people?When the innocent lives of 4 little \textbf{black} girls (Addie Mae Collins, Cynthia Wesley, Carole Robertson, and Denise McNair) were snuffed out, in the 16th Street Baptist church bombings of 1965, by the ‘superior \textbf{race}' (represented in this instance by the KKK) this was due to what, precisely?THE EXPERIENCE OF MANY \textbf{BLACK} PEOPLE IN AMERICA TODAYWhen Henry Louis Gates Jr., a \textbf{black} man, and professor at Harvard University was entering his own home and in the process was confronted by police, he needed to explain to the police his lawful entry into his own for what reason, precisely?When Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, and Freddie Gray were the police involved in stated murders endowed with some supernatural cognitive power that would allow them to conclude anything at all about the particular family environment from whence these \textbf{black} males came? Or was it, perhaps, the that stated \textbf{black} males were they playing their iPhones too loudly for the cops' liking?When the CDC "whistle blower", Dr. William S. Thompson, tells America that the CDC intentionally skewed and fudged data that indicated that young (up to 36 months) \textbf{African} American males were at a greater risk for autism when receiving a certain  vaccine (designed to immunize against measles, mumps, and rubella) then what does this say about the value and respect for \textbf{black} life express by some members of the 'superior \textbf{race}? Are these 36 month \textbf{old} \textbf{black} boys already being indicted and dehumanized by white society before they even get a chance to "act like subhumans" on any subway in America?When 21 year \textbf{old}, white American, Dylan Roof allegedly shoots and kills 9 \textbf{black} members of a bible study group in Charleston, SC we know that these murdered \textbf{black} people must have had it coming to them, and that they were either playing their music too loudly, or were the products of single parent households. Correct? Irrespective of the fact that the American congress allowed the supreme commander-in-chief, that most upstanding of white individuals, George H.W. Bush to initiate a war against Iraq on the basis of a carefully crafted lie, this according to your reasoning cannot be ascribed to any moral depravity of the greater white masses. Rather, this war should apparently, at the very least, be taken as yet another example of the ‘in-corruptible \textbf{race}' re-aligning the moral compass for the rest of humanity. Is that not true?When Paul Castellano, Italian American mafiosi and head of one the five criminal syndicates based in the boroughs of New York city (your favourite place to party) is gunned down in a gangland execution by rival mob factions we know that this, while morally reprehensible, can in no way be ascribed to the proclivities and sensibilities of white Americans as a whole, right? Further, we can go so far as to claim that these mobsters are not white people at all; they're \textbf{black}. After all, "this [type of behaviour] has absolutely no equivalent among any other \textbf{race}" except for \textbf{black} people according to you.When Ludwig Fainberg et al. were heading up the Russian mafia based out of Brighton Beach, New York they were, presumably, more interested in games of chess than in extortion, murder etc. and thus should never have been arrested and indicted. After all, these were 'good boys', from good families. At minimum, they were white men and we should all, presumably, take some comfort from that. Correct?Similarly, when \textbf{Whitey} Bulger (the notorious Irish American gangster based formerly out of Boston) was charged (in 2011) with no less than 19 counts of murder (among other things) we can safely assume that this must be some sort of mistake. \textbf{Whitey}, after all, is - dare I state it - white. He would never behave in such an irremissible manner. Hell, ol' \textbf{Whitey} has probably never acted like a 'subhuman' on the subway, or rocked an iPhone without the good sense to, at least, wear some gosh darn headphones. When white people attending the G20 summit (of 2010) in Toronto, Canada rampaged, looted, defaced and damaged property and fought with the police this can be dismissed as having \textbf{nothing} to do with the proclivities of whites in general, correct? And, the same conclusion can presumably be drawn after witnessing white people riot subsequent to a hockey game held in Vancouver, in 2011, no?Eighteen year \textbf{old} \textbf{black} male Michael Brown is confronted by a white cop and, though he (Michael Brown) is unarmed he is shot and killed  -  murdered  -  by this cop who apparently believed that the penalty for walking down the middle of the street (and not the sidewalk) is instant execution. By contrast, James Holmes, a 24 years \textbf{old} at the time, and a  white American, walks into a movie theatre dressed as Batman and allegedly unloads his guns against the patrons in the theatre, killing 12 people and injuring 58 other people but (lo and behold) Mr. Holmes is arrested by police. Not shot on the spot. Arrested. Mr. Holmes will began his day(s) in court in April of this year (2015). No such ‘luck' for Mike Brown who, as we know, is dead. Not arrested. Dead.When a white teenager, Ethan Couch (16 years \textbf{old} at the time was legally intoxicated and, as a result, slammed his pickup truck into four innocent people, killing them all), is deemed  by another white individual, Judge Jean Boyd, to be the victim of and suffering from some such affliction as "affluenza" (purportedly too rich to be expected to have been more responsible) and is not sentenced to jail but, rather, is given probation and ordered to report to a "rehab" clinic for rich kids this in no way should illicit a moment's pause or reflection on the privilege enjoyed by rich white Americans, correct?Never mind that the same judge, Jean Boyd, sentenced a 14 year \textbf{old} \textbf{black} minor to a 10 year sentence in a juvenile detention centre (after the un-named minor punched another individual who then fell hitting his head on the pavement and later died in hospital). Indeed, according to your statements, Ethan, like you  "at the end of the day get[s] to be white and enjoy all of the perks of being white and that's fine by [you]." It matters not, according to your own 'logic' that Ethan Couch's own familial upbringing can be called into question as evinced by the fact that none other than his (Ethan Couch's) father, Fred Couch  - apparently not wanting to be outdone by his son when it comes to behaving like a fool  -   was arrested for allegedly impersonating a cop. \textbf{Nothing} to see here though, and \textbf{nothing} can be inferred from this, right? These, after all, are white people ... I have to keep on reminding myself.SUMMARYI am not here suggesting that \textbf{black} people are beyond reproach. If we (i.e. \textbf{black} people) wish to be viewed as fully human then this, by definition, comes with certain 'baggage'; it means, at the outset, that we are not perfect. It means, also, that when we assert or humanity and our right to be treated with respect and dignity (before God, and before the U.S. Constitution) then we ought to be prepared for the inevitable and predictable countervailing assertion that says, basically, "Yeah, you see. Finally y'all admit that you people are a .. b .. c .. d etc.)In fact, all we're (i.e. \textbf{black} people) admitting' is that we are human. We have never relinquished, and we never will give up any of our rights before God and before the law. And, rest assured, we will prevail over those forces that would seek, as you do, to dehumanize us - all the while as we struggle with the failures and foibles of our humanity.A great, great man once told your forebears, and is saying to you, "Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me."\textbf{Black} people in America are, and always have been, the moral conscience of the republic.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Your "experiment" is a failure because you are making a fundamental mistake in your assumption that all factors are equal between all races (not BOTH races). You negate the historical actions of certain people. Humans have the natural ability to learn from the past and assess threats based on previous experience. What you are asking people to do is ignore that natural instinct and take the time to assess each person individually. Yes, that would be ideal in a perfect world, but our world is far from perfect. What you are asking people to do is akin to asking a gazelle not to fear a lion because THAT PARTICULAR lion didn't kill his family. Sure, there is a chance that the gazelle will be just fine and THAT PARTICULAR lion isn't going to hurt him, but it is unreasonable to expect the gazelle to take that chance.I am fully aware that you will disagree with these statements because you want to believe that all people are good and that we just haven't given certain people a fair chance or that they are at some sort of a disadvantage. But you're wrong. I'm sorry but the truth can be inconvenient at times. People usually act the way they do because of past experience, either their own or that of others. It doesn't make them right, but it is a natural instinct designed to protect them. In a perfect world, all men would be treated equally and the color of one's skin would be no more important than the color of their eyes, however as long as certain groups cast a negative light upon themselves (i.e. Baltimore looters) then there will always be a perpetuation of stereotypes.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small WHOA!! Seriously watch this video again because it only projects half the truth. WOW... Did I hear that correctly. B and W use marijuannauana equally,  yet B are 6 times more likely to be arrested. Arrested for what?  Marijuanna use, or committing other crimes? Also on average a B man gets charged \$700 more for a car than a W man. It's not  because the salesman is racis.  he's gonna try to get the most out of any \textbf{race} of costumer, that's his job and livelihood. The reason this statistic exists is because on average W are more educated than B. And thus Are more educated at negotiating car sales on average. Run that statistic using Asian, Hispanic, or \textbf{Indian} vs \textbf{Black} and on average blacks will pay more. Just a few examples at how this video isn't telling us the whole truth. But anyways.........This isn't just as much a BvsW issue its more of a poverty issue IMO.... Plz let me explain. There are many issues in poor or lower class families and I'm talking about all colors of skin. It doesn't just affect blacks, Infact poverty is color \textbf{blind} and affects "all colors of skin"  Most importantly is education. Statistics prove that children who grow up in lower income families, go to school with other kids who's families are lower income,  and live in a part of town that has higher crime rate, more drug use, gangs, ect. Kids who grow up in this environment are more likely to commit a crime, join a gang, use drugs, and have a lower level of education due to the above issues. And it will get repeated  again and again until "we the people" help to educate these young kids who's parents are cought in the cycle and aren't able to educate them.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Being an international student from Mongolia in the U.S, it's very interesting to look at it from an unbiased perspective. \textbf{Racism} does exist and there is white privilege, but then again, I observed a lot of \textbf{black} people acting as if people owe them something. People need to stop denying \textbf{racism} doesn't exist, pointing fingers, and trying to be victims in every situation. Mongolia has a diverse people with various range in skin tones, ranging from very dark, to eastern European looking, but we don't discriminate each other based on our skin tones, because we are Mongolians and of same \textbf{nationality}. Don't you think it's time the U.S came together as a \textbf{nation}?\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Nation, Nationality, Racism & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}5/113 & \cellcolor{green!5}4.425 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I like the video except that it mite be missing some facts but statistics also mite be a ever changing thing in this as well. I will say that \textbf{racism} is very much alive people, it is not to long ago that it started to really die off within the 1900's. That does not mean that it is completely gone. I have not been accepted by blacks, puerto ricans, except for a few white people who joke about \textbf{racism} and actual asians who do not. I say this only because blacks have been obviously oppressed their whole lives in america even though its a land of equal and great oppertunity. A contradiction yes but if you look at it once blacks were free, whites and people in general who were in power within the south would falsy imprison them for free labor in prison and such and so forth. Also  another point is that other \textbf{ethnic} groups worked on most of america like the railroads (asians). \textbf{Racism} is incredibly stupid but also has many of variables and things to honestly work out fact wise. This video, I like but it is missing some facts. Also this is just a piece of the puzzle the justice system frowns upon men in certain instances and equality is a far off dream at the moment but it is getting there.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Dolly Vader You need to consider the in-school factors which cause the \textbf{black} pupils under-achieving.Gillborn and Youdell found that \textbf{black} pupils in schools are more likely to be punished for a behaviour compared to white pupils- therefore, this leads to the higher exclusion of \textbf{black} boys and blacks being placed in lower sets thus leading to significant underachievement. \textbf{Black} working-class girls are doing far better than working-class white girls and Asian girls. Besides, during primary education \textbf{black} kids in general are doing the best however once they reach secondary education they begin to lack for various reasons; Sewell found that \textbf{black} boys have a range of response to teacher's \textbf{racist} labelling them as being rebellious and anti-school... Psychology claims that if one is constantly labelled negatively they act up on that label as a self-fulfillment prophecy conversely, white pupils are considered as 'ideal' therefore they have a higher self-esteem and are most likely to act up on their teacher's positive label. Research found that many \textbf{black} kids refuse to ask teachers for help because they want to avoid getting into trouble teacher's \textbf{racism} hence restricts their opportunities. Also, blacks have been effected greatly during the past of white supremacy so how could you make such an ignorant claim when \textbf{black} kids know that their ancestors have been enslaved? There's deep history regarding why \textbf{black} people aren't doing as well in schools not forgetting the fact that we have an ethnocentric curriculum which is made for the whites to achieve and the blacks to fail. Marketisation of education too plays a primary role- blacks can't get into the best schools offering the best education- the education system is racially segregated\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}11/280 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.929 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small +Sam  Well even if that is the case then why dont you apply this logic to sports. I think we can all agree that Asian are under represented in any sports. So to fix this :teams should have affirmative action for Asians to get pick instead of \textbf{African} Americans because of their \textbf{race} and not their qualifications. This is ridiculous and its no different than affirmative action in schools. And people that support this stupid ideology is pushing for supposedly equal rights, HA that makes me laugh. Would you want your favorite sports team to always lose because they were filled with a bunch of Asians that got in on their \textbf{race} and not their athletic capabilities . Or would want to have a surgeon that's not to sure on how to do the operation on you because he got into med school  because of his \textbf{race} and not his qualifications. I dont think you would want either of that ,but sadly we have that going on today in schools. Its baffling how every school text books,teacher ,politicians says the program help minorities  but in actuality it only helps Latinos and \textbf{African} Americans and is suppressing the smallest minority in America and that is Asian Americans.

They burn down their cities, they allow their communities to become ghettos, and do \textbf{nothing} but complain about oppression and the actions of people over 150 years ago. Instead of enriching their cultural development, and working to make their community better, they riot and complain. And any time anyone says so, they're labeled as a \textbf{racist} and shuffled under the rug. People who complain about their situation and do \textbf{nothing} to better it tend to be looked down upon. I know it's a tired example but look at Detroit. Look at any predominately \textbf{black} neighborhood and 9/10 times it's a ghetto. Instead of working to fix this, \textbf{black} people choose instead to put all the blame on whites. It's the white mans fault. It's because \textbf{racism}, it's because slavery. Maybe, just maybe, it's due in part to their own actions? Maybe their victimization has led them to complacency and enables them to continue to destroy their own culture and environment.  Sure, \textbf{black} people had a rough start in America after segregation. They didn't get the best start. But that isn't an excuse to perpetuate overall laziness and unwillingness to evolve past that. It's like getting a B in a class and using that as a reason to fail instead of working to get an A. The fact remains that \textbf{black} people today are largely to blame for their own predicament. Instead of trying to harpoon the "\textbf{racist}", spend more time to starting projects to help turn ghettos into better neighborhoods. Spend your time making the hood a safer place to live for the families there instead of complaining about oppression. Be the change you wish to see in the world. \textbf{Nothing} is going to change until someone changes it. \textbf{Black} people have a rich culture, they've contributed to music greatly, they have contributed to human rights, and a lot more.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small 1. Why would a white person rather choose a \textbf{black} to hire knowing about racial tension and cultural problems/differences? Not saying this can't be obviously an issue for \textbf{black}. But this could be an issue down the line for an employer especially if the \textbf{black} employee is let go they could claim "\textbf{racism}" just because they are \textbf{black}. 2. If you are savy online \& car shop you should be able to get a invoice price for a car before you go to the dealership which will be lower than the "in store price", as well you can negotiate a price in store. If you have the invoice you are guaranteed at least that price, if you don't negotiate you don't get a better deal. 3. If blacks are more likely to get pulled over, is it not possible they are more likey to be pulled over for an offense? For example a tale light was out, had illegal tinted windows, smog is coming out of the car etc. more often then whites because they are "poorer on average"? 4. Possibly they are shown 17 fewer houses because they "can't" afford as many options on average. 5. Blacks possibly get caught more with marajuana because they are more likely to be "selling it" or their car smells like weed when getting pulled over? 6. Blacks commit more crimes than whites so they are incarcerate more? 7. Open heart surgery don't know about that one. 8. Responding to blacks with \textbf{black} sounding names again goes back to racial and cultural never ending conflicts of interest.        Conclusion   You cannot make a correlation to be a negative or "\textbf{racism}" first and deny any other possiblities while presenting this as a "fact".

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small These statistics are all highly questionable. First, in our current jew/marxist anti-White cultural climate, these types of studies are often undertaken with the intent to 'prove' discrimination and the honesty of the study is to be questioned.But specifically:'\textbf{Black}-sounding names were 50 less likely to be called back.'   Well what are '\textbf{black}-sounding' names? If they included the made-up names so prevalent among negroes (Laquanda, Quinita, Shaniqua, etc.) then experience will prove to anyone that these non-conforming names are a hallmark of an economic underclass. So if a bias did actually exist, it could simply be the perception of the less educated. And for those that would say the resume would show an education, I point out that most degrees are essentially meaningless these days, with university standards being in the toilet, including due to affirmative action. So having a degree on a resume is no longer any indication of whether the person is smart, or intellectually disciplined. '\textbf{Black} people are charged prices roughly \$700 higher than White people when buying cars.'\textbf{Black} people have worse credit from earning less money and not paying their bills on time, and so are paying higher finance charges. So it's not discrimination against blacks, but against people with bad credit history. 'Multiple studies show \textbf{black} drivers are twice as likely to get pulled over.' This proves discrimination against blacks ONLY if you believe the lie that there are no behavior differences between races. The fact is that blacks are more likely to be committing infractions that get them pulled over. I've lived in predominantly \textbf{black} areas and can attest to this myself, with blacks more likely to do very stupid anti-social things on the road like driving in breakdown lanes on the highway, using right turn lanes as ways to jump ahead of cars in the lane to go straight, and other nonsense. '\textbf{Black} clients are shown 17.7 fewer houses for sale.'   Blacks make less money, so there are fewer houses they can afford compared to higher earning Whites and Asians. 'Marijuana use is equal between blacks and whites. Yet \textbf{black} people are 4 times more likely to be arrested.'First, it doesn't say what they are arrested for, which is cause for suspicion. But even if what it wants you to infer is true, see above. Blacks are often behaving in other ways that get them stopped by police, who will then charge them with everything else they find them doing that's illegal, whether it's holding marijuana or a switch blade. '\textbf{Black} people are incarcerated at nearly six times the rate of White people.' The easiest one to debunk. Blacks commit more crimes. Period. End of story. \textbf{Black} males are 6 of the population and commit 45 of all murders. OF COURSE they're more likely to be in jail, as they should be. 'White legislators did not respond as frequently to constituents with \textbf{black} sounding names'.Same as above about '\textbf{black} sounding names'. It bespeaks of lower class people, those with less money and social influence and so they are less useful to a politician. Then it ends with 'If this isn't \textbf{racism}…'Yes, it ISN'T \textbf{racism}. For 100 years now the subversive jews (like jew ROBERT GREENWALD of Brave New Films) who hate Whites and this country have been pumping out propaganda that \textbf{black} failure is evidence of White oppression. But they claim it is to be assumed there are no differences between races, when the science has proven over and over again that \textbf{RACE} IS REAL, and the differences include intelligence, temperament and behavior, and physical abilities.No more jew lies. No more undeserved White guilt. Blacks are failures because of their inherent differences. If you truly love negroes, and especially if you subscribe to the faith-based new-state-religion that they are just as capable as Whites, then you should support deporting all American negroes to Africa to live up to their full potential away from White 'oppression' and free to create their own culture and civilization, rather than continue to underperform in ours.And the \textbf{alien} agitators and destroyers in our midst like ROBERT GREENWALD of Brave New Films need to be expelled with them.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Alien, Black, Race, Racism & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}10/695 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.439 \\  \hline

After slavery, there was the \textbf{Jim C\textbf{row}} era, after the \textbf{Jim C\textbf{row}} era which was a little over 50 years ago, we're still fighting for equality, still trying to see change. For too many years white people have bullied \textbf{black} people but when we fight back suddenly we're wrong. There is no such thing as reverse \textbf{racism}. A bully can't hit the defensless and when the defensless suddenly hit back call him a bully as well.

Absolutely \textbf{nothing}. One might think the white man is a christan man, hard-working business owner, married with two children living the all-American dream. One might think the \textbf{black} man is an uneducated thug, jobless, father of 6 (but not in their lives) who sells drugs for a living. And it's truly sad because that's how people see it when in reality, the roles could be switched but the majority in America are brain-washed and is suffocating in their false-sense of superiority. The media is biased, and only appeals to the majority on certain issues . For example, what's going on in Baltimore. But have you even heard about what's going on in Huntington, California? Probably not. The white youth there, is rioting over a surfing tournament. Fighting each other, looting stores. But that doesn't get any press? I wonder why.

Me and my brother have been stopped many times by the police in the community we grew up in for just walking to and from the park, naturally they were insulting and tried hard to humiliate us each time, on these walks I've had other white people see me, cross the street, and cross back when they pass, and we've had police search our homes because they found an \textbf{old} ID of a friend who had a warrant in my brothers car.The \textbf{crazy} thing is it was a nice neighborhood and I looked like a nerd, but we still had cops hounding us for \textbf{nothing}. I think a lot of people wouldn't believe that stuff happened.Back to the point, I agree blacks have been disadvantaged, but I don't think its the role of our corrupt government to supply people with other peoples money because ones struggles is more popular than the other. I think Natives should keep what they were given, but I don't think they should be constantly given regular payments or anything.How much do you trust our government to do good this time when given the right to treat people differently on \textbf{race}?

Also, seeing how you feel the need to reassure your supposed smartness really only shows your insecurity regarding your intelligence.Lets use history and \textbf{common} sense. \textbf{African} tribes maintained fierce rivalry with each other for many generations. Why would a white waste his time kidnapping other slaves when they can just buy them and sell them for profit? It was far more efficient to buy them. Fighting was a \textbf{common} thing, the blacks were going to kidnap more \textbf{black} people for slavery in the next raid anyway.Also, slaves being transferred to America only came from coastal regions (for obvious reasons). That does not mean that \textbf{black} people were not enslaving each in \textbf{African} regions. In fact, Muslim Africans enslaved white Europeans.

Also, I reassure my smartness because you keep bring it up. The slaves in Africa were not treated as harshly as the \textbf{African} slaves sold to the Europeans. Europeans solely wanted \textbf{African} slaves because of inferiority reasons such as the color of their skin. \textbf{African} slaves in Africa were usually enslaved as a punishment for a crime but they could work to buy their freedom. Before the transatlantic slave trade in Africa (which became the most dominant slave trade), Africans were already skilled in art, technology, medicine, mathematics and astronomy. So trying to depict Africa as uncivilized before the Europeans came is sad on your part because sadly, they weren't.I'm not saying that I come from a \textbf{race} of saints, but are you really going to try to deny the fact that the destruction YOUR \textbf{race} has caused on a global scale was minimal?

We use the term \textbf{race} to distinguish different groups of people based on the characteristics that natural selection intended for humans living in certain regions.

Most of the middle eastern and Asian people did fine. The same could not be said for \textbf{black} or Hispanics of any \textbf{race}.

Malcolm X was known for enlightening \textbf{black} people that they are not the problem like everyone says so, but white people, who have been telling us for years that we are the problem to our own problems. That is not true.   The \textbf{black} wall street area of Tulsa, Oklahoma was one of the wealthiest African-American communities in the country. In 1921, the area was destroyed during a \textbf{race} riot. Whites were the ones who rioted in Tulsa, blacks defended their territory. But they were destroyed by the whites who were envious of their economic power base that they had developed. Tulsa became the first city in the world that was bombed from the air. It was bombed by sticks of dynamite.  The world at the time knew what was happening to \textbf{black} people so they were going to give benefits to \textbf{black} businesses, even in Europe because France was getting ready to do business with Tulsa, Oklahoma and so was England (expect for parts in parliament that did not want that), Canada, South America and almost all of Africa. So yes, back then when we tried to do good despite all the bad that was happening around us, white people took it away.  \textbf{Black} people have never gotten anything from the government at the exclusion of another group. \textbf{Black} people have never gotten welfare at the exclusion of another group nor affirmative action at the exclusion of another group.Affirmative Action was originally "Corrective Action" for something that the government has consistently done to append, to exploit, degrade and to degenerate a specific group of people. \textbf{Black} people were the only group of  people that the government went out of their way to systematically, educationally and economically oppress.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}8/319 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.508 \\  \hline

However, you are not educated. In fact, you give off a narcissistic vibe. Do not flatter yourself.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Аркадий Адамовская A lot of people say things like "immigrants with \textbf{nothing} come to America and succeed.   Why can't \textbf{black} Americans do the same?"I would like to address this from two different directions:1. Roughly 24-27 (it fluctuates every year) of \textbf{black} Americans live below the poverty line.  I got that statistic from 2010 US census data, (since I know you are a stickler for people citing their sources.)   Granted, that is almost triple the percentage of white Americans who live in poverty, but to try and intimate that poverty and blackness are synonymous is inaccurate.  I myself am an upper middle-class \textbf{black} adult who was born and raised in an upper middle-class household to parents who had themselves been born and raised in middle-class households by their own parents who had what passed for \textbf{black} middle-class origins in the \textbf{Jim C\textbf{row}} South.  I am not an anomaly, or some kind of rare unicorn of \textbf{black} success.   Most \textbf{black} Americans are middle-class, and some of us are even wealthy, which means that we are getting educations and working and supporting ourselves and our families.  Don't try to pretend that "ghetto" culture or "thug" culture is the full scope of \textbf{black} culture.  Most of us are just regular people who have the same relative values and work ethic as the next (white/asian/latino/whatever) schmoe, except that we often have people asking us "why can't your people just get over slavery and \textbf{racism} and pull it together?"  Considering the things that \textbf{black} folks had to fight against only one or two generations ago, I'd say that a lot of us have indeed "gotten ourselves together."   Some of us are having a harder time of it.  You could help, if you want to; if you care.  There's no law that says that only \textbf{black} people are allowed to mentor poor \textbf{black} children or donate books to poorly-funded schools in bad neighborhoods.  Or you can continue to  say \textbf{black} people are responsible for their own problems and feel no obligation to do anything but sit back and feel smug about it.  That's your choice, too.2.  You may not believe it, but many poor \textbf{black} children are not ever told by anyone who matters to them that they can be smart and successful.   They don't see many real life examples of hard work resulting in economic stability.  They have downtrodden parents who work long hours at low-wage jobs (or sometimes don't work at all, for various legitimate or illegitimate reasons,) and are one missed or shorted paycheck from living on the street. They have jaded teachers who expect them to under-perform and who shrug their shoulders when they fail (many of the optimistic teachers burn out or move on to better school districts ASAP.)  They have peers who perpetuate the idea that education is for white people by calling any \textbf{black} child who speaks properly and likes to read/study a fake/phony/oreo/\textbf{race} traitor, and humiliate them or ostracize them until they fall back into what's "expected" of them.   They have the vast majority of the media glamorizing criminal behavior in the "urban community," telling them that the only guaranteed ticket out of the ghetto is slinging drugs or becoming a rap star.Oh, or playing pro ball, because blacks may not be too smart, but they sure can run fast./sarcasmAll of that is demoralizing, and some people are strong enough to overcome it and succeed anyway, but most people (of whatever \textbf{race}) tend to take the path of least resistance, only working just hard enough to maintain the status-quo.  A lot of the people who come to America from other countries are already of the mindset that America is a place where, if you work hard enough, you can succeed.   They are already the very rare kind of person who would do WHATEVER it takes to have a good life, as opposed to the billions of average people all over the world who die in the same relative income bracket as the one into which they were born.  Most people born into wealth stay wealthy, most people born in the middle class stay in the middle class, and most people born into poverty stay poor.

That means that even though my parents divorced and I spent most of my formative years in a single-parent household, my mom, by virtue of her sterling education, (and also the occasional bit of cronyism,) was able to secure a well-paying, 9-to-5, white collar career that enabled her to spend a lot of time with me as a kid (instead of having to work extra shifts to pay bills) and to keep us living in safe neighborhoods free of drugs and gang violence.  That means I encountered relatively few people who made me feel that I might be inherently inferior for reasons beyond my control.  That means that, even when I encountered hardship, I never assumed that the chips were stacked against me.None of what I've said is meant to imply that I excuse criminal activity in poor communities, or condone it, or think that gang bangers, drug addicts, high school drop-outs, and/or people making too many babies when they have no way to support them are free from responsibility for their lives being shitty.  I'm just saying that it's incredibly hard to rise above that shit--especially when people are more inclined to dismiss you as worthless than to help--and most human beings lack the wherewithal to conquer that.That's not a flawed world view, that's simply \textbf{bald} realism.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Bald, Black & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Physical Identity - Physical Features & \cellcolor{green!5}3/450 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.667 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Nearly all of these examples of "\textbf{racism}" can be explained by logical and rational differences between the races1. Blacks less likely to get called backThe level of intelligence, criminality, time preference, and drug use are different between the races even when factoring in income and level of education. Rationally employers should choose the better candidate which would be the white one.2. \textbf{Black} people charged \$662 more for carsAre we to assume that this discrepancy is because they hate \textbf{black} people? More than likely this is because \textbf{black} people will accept a higher price than white people and not ask for a lower one. It's more than likely that blacks simply aren't negotiating down the price as much as white people. If this is not true and they're just pricing cars higher for blacks then why not charge the same for whites? They're a company: If they could get away with getting more money then they would.3. Blacks twice as likely to be pulled overWell, it's probably that blacks are more likely to break traffic laws or be in places that have higher police supervision. This is true with violent crime and drug crime so I would expect the same to be true with traffic violations.4. Blacks and whites use drugs equally but blacks more likely to be arrestedIt is true that if you poll people on their drug use blacks and whites report equal amounts of drug use. However, if you actually test them for drugs you will find a very different story. Turns out that blacks are far, far more likely to use drugs, use them more frequently than whites, AND lie about it.5. \textbf{Black} 6 times more likely to be incarceratedBlacks are also far more likely to commit crime. Look at the National Crime Victimization survey and you will find that when people are surveyed on the crimes committed against them they report a high level of \textbf{black} criminality.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Christan Price Tim Wise actually brings up a good point. In my initial comment I said as a white person I am more likely than a \textbf{black} person to be the victim of interracial violence. But this was a very empty comment; what do I mean when I say "as a white person"? Do I mean as a member of the group of all white humans on Earth? Do I mean as a member of the group of all white Americans? Surely Swiss people, Nigerians, and white residents of Concord, New Hampshire are each barely likely at all to be the victims of interracial violence. So let me now be more precise. Between white people who frequently interact with blacks and \textbf{black} people who frequently interact with whites, I as such a white person am significantly more likely than my \textbf{black} counterpart to be the victim of interracial violence.Tim Wise points out that any given \textbf{black} American is 2.75 times more likely than a white American to be interracially murdered. This is true, but what if we redrew the lines for a moment and considered American and/or continental \textbf{African} victims of interracial murder. Then clearly blacks would be significantly less likely to be interracially murdered as continental Africans barely experience it at all. Now if we redrew the lines again to consider American and/or \textbf{African} and/or European victims of interracial murder, then at this point it might come out closer to equal probabilities for interracial murder. The point at which Wise's argument breaks down is the point at which he ignores the tens of millions of whites in the Midwest and in New England who don't interact with blacks at all and thus bring down the white victimhood rate down tremendously. These particular millions of whites do not have \textbf{black} counterparts who can avoid interacting with the other \textbf{race} in the same proportion. These whites might as well be on another continent, or on Mars, for all the good they do in helping us understand the problem of victimhoods.So in my opinion the best place to really see what's going on is individual cities that have large \textbf{black} and white populations. I live in Atlanta, which is about as evenly-split as it gets. Tim Wise says I shouldn't fear that one in fifty \textbf{black} men will do something violent in a given year, but I pass by fifty \textbf{black} people every day on public transport. And I have no idea what Wise is trying to prove with the W-B and B-W encounter relative percentages; it makes no sense to me. I would think that every one W-B encounter would equal one B-W encounter, so (W-B encounters) = (B-W encounters) at all times. So if \textbf{black} people and white people were equally violent, the number of W-B crimes would be equal to the number of B-W crimes, period. I have no idea why he thinks I should be pleased that the rate of \textbf{black} on white crime isn't quite as high as he thinks it would be if only blacks were even more violent to whites to reflect how violent they are to other blacks; \textbf{black}-on-white still accounts for MOST of the interracial crime, just like he says.Every time I walk past a \textbf{black} man on the sidewalk late at night, he doesn't know me and I don't know him. There is a microscopic chance that he will be victimized by me as I pass him by. There is a microscopic chance that I will be victimized by him as he passes by. But my microscopic chance to be victimized is about 5 times worse than his. Over time you see these microscopic cross sections add up; \textbf{black} people are responsible for almost all the crime and violence in Atlanta, despite being only a bit over half of the residents.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African, Black, Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}15/642 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.336 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@planeshaperman From the statistics , it looks like the majority of the crime is non violent drug offences, dis orderly conduct, and dui's for Atlanta. [LINK]  [LINK]  [LINK] It also looks like  violent crime is on a sharp decline and has been for some time now. So you are literally getting safer every year. That being said, Im going to assume that most of the violent crime in Atlanta is interracial as would be consistent with national crime statistics (I couldn't find stats on this in particular). Now "if" this is the case then even though you are 5 times more likely to be the victim of this \textbf{black} man on the street than he yours, the overall threat of an attack from him is very low and decreasing every year. You are both more dangerous to your neighbors than each other. Also, this fear of \textbf{black} people is almost entirely based on \textbf{race} not crime statistics. Each one of us regardless of our population demographic is usually most at risk from someone we know inside our own \textbf{race}. When there white people see white people get murdered by other white people they don't fear other white people and move to \textbf{black} neighborhoods lol and the same is true of \textbf{black} people. So you're relatively safe from the \textbf{black} people in your city. but don't be stupid and go to a bad neighborhood on purpose with a wad of cash asking for directions at midnight from the shady looking \textbf{black} guy selling drugs on the corner.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}8/256 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.125 \\  \hline

Also, if you want to keep going back in time hypothetically as you are, there is more open police brutality against \textbf{black} people, unfair sentencing, unfair hiring practices, the threat of white lynch mobs go up. So if you are safer from \textbf{black} people the further you go back in the past it has a lot to do with \textbf{racism}.

I said violent crime is and has been on sharp decline for years and that you are literally getting safer each year. YOU brought up 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010 so how am I bullshitting you? I said "almost" all those time periods because I was accounting for the 90's but it does not detract from my point. Your argument is essentially that you will be safer in a majority white city. My point is that white or \textbf{black} it doesn't matter as highlighted by Atlanta violent crime being on the decline regardless of racial demographics and correlation between \textbf{black} and white is irrelevant to that decline. You saying that Oakland, Detroit, and Cleveland were safer in the 70's "because" there were more white people in those cities is as baseless claim as me saying Atlanta is safer now because there are fewer white people.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!27}2/156 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.282 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Christan Price My initial intention for this comment thread was to inform \textbf{black} people of the cause of white racial attitudes, and to advise white people on the best strategies to maximize their safety. Almost all white people in mixed cities could increase their safety by moving to white cities, so I advise that they do so. You're advising white people in mixed cities to increase their safety by just waiting around for crime to naturally decline. That may increase their safety but it won't maximize it. Mixed cities 30 years from now may be safer than white cities today, but mixed cities 30 years from now will be less safe than white cities 30 years from now.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!5}1/118 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.847 \\  \hline

And also to predict that white cites will be safer than mixed cites 30 years from now in spite of all trends and statistical data. In order to believe this you have to willfully ignore all history of \textbf{black} and white people in America, all reliable data on violent crime in America, and all current trends that point to the opposite of this position including the rate at which individuals of mixed \textbf{race} heritage are being born.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small +Carla Rock  Oh you poor ignorant fool. The reason why people have an issue when someone says "I'm proud to be white", is  because historically being white, was never something people were told to be ashamed of. Even today blonde hair, blue eyes, and white skin is considered the epitome of beauty around the world. When someone says "I'm proud to be \textbf{black}" or "proud to be Latinx" or "proud to be Arab", it's because these specific groups of people are constantly told that they should not be proud of who they are. That their features are ugly and that their inferior. It's a way to try to rise above hate and discrimination and \textbf{racism}. Not to mention "white pride" is typically a phrased used  by white supremacists and neo-nazis. There doesn't need to be a "white lives matter" because as far as the judicial system and cops are concerned, white lives already matter. Give me one time in US history where white lives have not mattered. \textbf{Black} lives matter is meant to draw attention to the alarming rate of police brutality against \textbf{black}  people, because \textbf{black} people are more likely to be killed by police than ANY OTHER \textbf{RACE}, including white people. But you are right on one thing. Whites don't go around trashing cities after a \textbf{black} cop kills a white person. Nope. You guys just riot over football and hockey games and pumpkin festivals.

Doing some simple research you will see that there were more White fatalities at the hands of the police in 2012 (most recent data) than that of Blacks. How many White riots did you see? Paying more for a car is bad negotiating, being shown less houses probably has more to do with affordability. The resume does have a point, but it goes back to the perception I mentioned earlier. Now comes the criminal aspect. As for pot, is it a percentage comparison or overall number comparison, either way it is irrelevant at this point as the numbers are altered with the legalization of.

It should be noted that those neither those who conducted the studies nor Malcolm Gladwell himself, who is half Jamaican, believe that conscious \textbf{racism} is at fault for the actions of the employers and car dealers, respectively. Rather, it appears that the human brain has absorbed the information presented to it on an unconscious level and subsequently reacts differently when dealing with African-Americans as opposed to how it reacts to dealing with other races. I suggest going to the Harvard website and taking a few IATs, which test your preferences between races on an unconscious level. The author of the book, regardless of his Jamaican background, found his unconscious to be preferential towards whites over blacks, showing just how pervasive the stereotypes presented to us can be. Its a good read, particularly when paired with Victor Rios' Unpunished, in which the author shadows at risk and gang involved youth in an ethnography focused on the results of hypercriminalization in Oakland, CA.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small As a white man, I have seen prejudice and \textbf{racism} with my own eyes. I remember I went to an interview for a dog training job at Petco. It was a group interview, consisting of me (a white man) and two other individuals (a \textbf{black} \textbf{woman}, and a \textbf{black} man). Both of those individuals had extensive dog training experience, and I had none whatsoever. During the interview I began to feel very insignificant and less qualified than the other two individuals. They were both professional and I was certain that either one of them would get the job before me. I could tell, however, that during the interview, the (white) interviewer seemed to be favoring me over the others, he looked at me much more, was more engaging, etc. Two days after the interview I got a call back saying that he'd like to offer me the dog training job. Wow! I mean, damn.....I felt really bad. It was quite clearly a case of prejudice, he was favoring me because I was a white male like him.Anyway, it was pretty messed up. I declined to accept the job and he sounded really disappointed. Hopefully he offered the job to one of the other candidates.Prejudice and \textbf{racism} exists, yes. But you have to realize that it seems to come from all groups. \textbf{Racism} is "natural" in the sense that humans tend to group together by likeness, there is \textbf{nothing} wrong with this, but unfortunately in today's society we need to blend together more than we need to isolate one another. Also, \textbf{black} people need to make a distinction between \textbf{racism} and prejudice. Often what is called "\textbf{racism}" is really just mild prejudice. I doubt many people are truly \textbf{racist}, but many are prejudiced.As a white man, I have been on the receiving end of prejudice. Yes, I have. For example, there is a Bangladeshi restaurant nearby that I used to go to but I don't anymore because every time I went in, the majority Bangladeshi patrons who dine there would stare at me and kind of give me this look like, "What is this guy doing here?" Even the staff would treat me kind of coldly while they treated the other patrons with warmth and gentility. I'm sorry, but that's prejudice. If minority groups feel like they are treated unfairly by whites, than they need to avoid treating white people unfairly when the white person is in the minority. Also, nepotism's tend to form among minority groups. Why aren't they being pressured to be more inclusive? Why is it that neighborhoods tend to break down among racial lines? The Asians congregate with the Asians, the Indians congregate with the Indians, the blacks with the blacks, etc. It's not only white people seeking their own, it's every other group as well, but yet it's white people who get all the bad rep. I have to say that Asians get very mistreated in society, blacks don't like them and Asians don't like blacks. Why aren't either of these groups under pressure to change? You see, everybody is \textbf{racist}, but it's only white's that we hear about. Asians discriminate against blacks all the time.....Also, \textbf{black} people are some of the most \textbf{homophobic} people in society, and it's odd to hear this group who complains about being discriminated against to then turn right around and discriminate against gays.White people discriminate for sure, I acknowledge that. But there's plenty of pie to go around and blame to be put on everyone, not just whites. Gandhi said "Be the change you wish to see in the world."

On the other hand there ia a statistic applied  \@" 00:47 " which is very much explanatory, since one can argue, that these prices may vary from the location, time of purchasment and lastly the type of the car.III. Furthermore one can argue, that the facts presented \@" 01:16 " could be a much viable consequence the police draws from the ratio of crime in a specific (ethical)groups. Since investigation shall always correlate with the commission of crimes. Say, if more criminal cases are much more commen so should be the investigations.IV. Therefore is the statistic worked in \@" 01:43 " just partly comprehensible, due to the prior made conclussion, that ethical blacks could be investigated much more frequently for a rational reason. Twice as much investigations are bound to lead to twice as much arrestments if the consumption rate of marijuan is the same, which is the case in west America and other reginal locations.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@thesmoothdoran I don't think you understand. The reason why white people pay less for a car is because dealers are more willing to negotiate with them. Why? Because dealers think white people are "smarter about cars" and \textbf{black} people are "more likely to be duped." So if, as you say, car dealers should be more likely to target \textbf{black} people because they know blacks will pay more, it's because this belief is based on a \textbf{racist} idea. The study on this was done by the National Bureau of Economic Research.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/90 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.333 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Chloe Hwang you seem to have heavily misunderstood what I said. you said that this "belief" was based off a \textbf{racist} idea, when actually the idea was based off the video. I don't need to look up crap and search through files if the information was right there in the video. all I did was take the idea and put it under a business perspective. what you say about the "smarter about cars thing" doesn't relate, or rather it makes no sense at all. you almost prove my point by agreeing that a white man can get away with purchasing a car for less than a \textbf{black} man because they negotiate better. From the business perspective, it a car dealer can sell a car at a high price, they will go that route. If they thought that a white man is smarter about it then they would avoid that situation and go where they can increase profit. Of course that is just a business perspective of what the video says was true. If you look at the first sentence I wrote I said it was a load of crap, as in this is a lie. car dealerships don't actually purposefully sell a car at a higher price to \textbf{black} people than white people. when it comes to negotiation, it is an even playing field where the price can go anywhere. for example, two white people are purchasing two of the same car, one happens to buy that car at a lower price because he got there by his means, not the dealers. I would go on to give more examples but I think you already get the point. I'm just saying that at no point do I accept the idea of \textbf{black} people paying more for a car a white person can buy for less as truth. I think its propaganda that will encourage more riots over useless matters. I know you know about the riot that happened recently. A report came out that the spinal injuries that the \textbf{black} guy got were pre-existing, meaning that the cops did not do anything to the guys spine. now what do all those rioters have to say for themselves? geez, this was annoyingly long and I am done with responses. for the sake of your time, and mine, don't respond to this comment.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}5/391 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.279 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@thesmoothdoran Sorry I'll reply if I want to, although it's clear that you have no understanding of logical reasoning. The point of the video is that there is NOT an even playing field between blacks and whites. As much as you say and think there is, try being a \textbf{black} person for one day and see how differently people treat you. Car dealerships, and many other Americans, have implicit biases that make them treat \textbf{black} people differently from white people. As the video says, dealers charge blacks more and they back it up with a nationally conducted study.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Chloe Hwang now you've gone and practically threw the proverbial train off the tracks. If you are honestly telling me that you believe and that it is totally true that \textbf{black} people have to pay more for the same car a white person could by for less, all that does is prove the business perspective I talked about right! If a \textbf{black} person has no idea how to negotiate terms with a car dealer, then its his fault for falling into the trap, rather than rioting in the streets, they could try to fix this practice using rational means, If car dealers are exploiting \textbf{black} people, having \textbf{black} people turn the tables in an intellectual way would create a greater and far less bitter effect on the car dealing business. It would be very smart for someone who doesn't know how to negotiate to either bring someone with him that can, or learn it for himself. White or \textbf{black}, it will have to same effect. Even I don't know that much on negotiation, but If I know one thing, its that you don't throw the money on the table before deciding what car you want and how much you want to pay. If people have this HUGE bias about \textbf{black} people, wouldn't it be smart to FIX IT?!?!?!! by fix it I don't mean riot, I mean proving to those kinds of people wrong by doing exactly what they don't expect a \textbf{black} person to do! logical reasoning?!?! your going to tell me I don't have logical reasoning because I don't believe a car dealer would purposefully, out of their own will, go out of their way to charge a \textbf{black} person more than a white person?!?! What If the car dealer is \textbf{black}? are they going to exploit the opposite \textbf{race}? or are you telling me that it is policy to charge a \textbf{black} man more? what if the case scenario comes about where a white person ends up paying more than a \textbf{black} person did? is it because one was a better negotiator? Or was it because there was a policy to charge a white man more? All of this points to propaganda and stereotypes. Not logical reasoning and not \textbf{racism}. Even assuming that all this bull is true, It isn't even \textbf{racism}! \textbf{racism} is when one \textbf{race} believes their \textbf{race} is better than another. A car dealer charging a \textbf{black} man more than a white man doesn't mean he sees \textbf{black} people as a lesser \textbf{race}, rather, it would be exactly what you said earlier. It would be that he believes a white man has negotiation skills that a \textbf{black} man doesn't, that isn't \textbf{racism}, its stereotyping.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Race, Racism & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}21/450 & \cellcolor{green!27}4.667 \\  \hline

It's as if two people are running a \textbf{race}, but the \textbf{black} man has to start 10 miles behind the white man. You said "If people have this HUGE bias about \textbf{black} people, wouldn't it be smart to FIX IT?!?!?!!" - you really don't think \textbf{black} people have been trying for decades to do this exact thing? The media obviously doesn't report this, but \textbf{black} people in Baltimore have been protesting peacefully for decades to end racial profiling, speak out against militarization of police, etc. Why don't you try being empathetic to their reality instead of blaming the victim. \textbf{Black} people are rioting IN RESPONSE to decades of mistreatment from American society.

Hold up, what if the cops really didn't do anything to the guy? was all this destruction worth it? or is there an ulterior motive behind it? perhaps, these kids were just waiting for the slightest reasoning, real or fake, to jump all over cars and attack police and not get arrested for it. perhaps not. even so, there is another place to touch up on. why was Grey running from the cops? wouldn't a cop have to use more force to a person trying to evade him? its not really fair to say it was all the cops, or white peoples, fault. what if the cop was a \textbf{black} man? what if this \textbf{black} cop was the one who had accidentally caused the spinal injury? no one would cry out, no one would riot.

That means that \textbf{nothing} that I, as an individual (especially a fairly powerless individual), do could be \textbf{racist}, only bigoted. It means that you believe that groups communally share power; apparently, the fact that some Whites are filthy rich, and that much of the power in the country is held by Whites, means that all Whites are responsible for how that power is used and shared. The trouble is, it doesn't work that way.I've spent half my life in poverty.

Pay close attention to that short-term benefit mentality, as it comes up again and again when companies do something stupid.Employers like to hire safe bets, people who will not cost much money, but produce exceptional products at low risk. That means that they don't like to hire someone they don't know, or that is \textbf{handicapped}, or that is not young, or that is too far out of the norm for their workplace. That's the safe bet for them, and it is in their own short term interest, usually, to place these safe bets. Of course, that has its own problems of stagnation, but that's another issue. Employers don't like to fix what is working sufficiently well, don't like to spend money if they don't have to, and don't like to hire anyone who might disturb the quiet operation of their shop. They don't like to train or research. They want an instant return that doesn't cost them much (or any) money.

They contend that scholarly misrepresentation has denigrated indigenous peoples when in fact they lived together in peace and harmony. In rebutting that contention, this groundbreaking book presents clear evidence—from multiple academic disciplines—that indigenous populations engaged in warfare and ritual violence long before European contact. In ten well-documented and thoroughly researched chapters, fourteen leading scholars dispassionately describe sources and consequences of Amerindian warfare and violence, including ritual violence. Originally presented at an American Anthropological Association symposium, their findings construct a convincing case that bloodshed and killing have been woven into the fabric of indigenous life in North America for many centuries." [LINK] "The presence of violent conflict and warfare is widely acknowledged throughout the Pre-Columbian Americas. A perusal of the recent literature on Pre-Columbian warfare reveals that much of the work is regionally focused or primarily concerned with the evolution of violent conflict from formative to increasingly complex societies. Lacking, however, is a dialogue on Pre-Columbian warfare that recognizes the striking parallels in certain practices—captive taking, human sacrifice, warfare as statecraft, violence as ritual—that occur across the hemisphere."

OK, but where are they buying the cars from? is it a fixed price? Are they buying the exact same car from the exact same dealership? If so and the sellers are seriously looking at the colour of the buyers skin and deciding there and then how much they're going to charge them despite it initially being a fixed price then that it is illegal and should promptly be reported to the authorities. 3."\textbf{black} drivers are twice as likely to get pulled over." OK, but what are they being pulled over for? Are the policespecifically looking into drivers windows to determine the \textbf{race} of the driver so that they can pull them over for absolutely no reason? if so what do they tell them they're being pulled over for as they're required by law to do so? Ifthey were pulled over for no reason this too should be reported as it's a misconduct on the officers part, if not and they were driving recklessly then good, they should be pulled over. 4."\textbf{black} clients are shown 17.7 fewer houses for sale" OK, but the realtor will attempt to sell the highest price house to any buyer regardless of their skin colour in order to obtain the highest commission. How were these figures obtained? Are they on the basis of the amount of houses that an equal number of \textbf{black} and white people were shown? Did they have the same budget/price range? Where they each looking for property in the same Area? In the same time period? I very much doubt it. 5."\textbf{black} people are 4 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana use" The reason for this one is not that police will simply let a white person off with a slap on the wrist yet arrest a \textbf{black} person for the same crime. The reason isthe areas that the marijuana is being smoked in. The police will frequently patrol ghettos and rough areas in which it's no secret have a higher proportion of \textbf{black} people than they do white people.

It should be noted that ‘preferential treatment' does not mean that these individuals will automatically be preferred to another candidate, but rather should two candidates be deemed a similar level, the individual from the minority group will be preferred.For example, should two candidates who are equally matched in skills go for a job and one is from a minority group and one isn't, then positive discrimination will see that the former candidate will receive the job offer." ( [LINK]   In essense 'positive discrimination' is the act of discrimination on the basis of skin colour, however as long as it's done to the white \textbf{race} it's not only legal but it's seen as a good, 'positive' thing, you little moron.  Nice little analogy though.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Race & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/167 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.599 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@kazooga 1234 Proof?Alright lets break this down by the sources.1) University of Chicago Field Study in 2003 for hiring \textbf{black} sounding names.      [LINK]      First of all, this field study was done from 2001-2002 which makes it 13 years \textbf{old} when published. Using one source to claim that \textbf{racism} is vastly apparent in the workforce of today that is over a decade \textbf{old} is just plain silly and misleading.     Second, while this study seemed to support a trend towards racial discrimination in all backs, it becomes extremely difficult to truly compare their findings. We do not know just how many people the employers called as a whole, nor do we know the specifics of the resumes concerning qualifications. All we see from this article are the generalizations used in their studies and the findings they claim to have found through their methods.2) New York Times Economic Review: Racial Bias Even When We Have Good Intentions. 2015     The author that wrote this article is the exact author from the previous source. He paired with Marianne Bertrand to co-author the 2003 Chicago Field Study. Using him in two of your sources for \textbf{racism} is biased. He even cited the Cardiac Catheterization from 1999 and the 2011 Yale University field experiment with state legilators which I'll get to in a bit. The sources being used are all from the same person, this video is extremely biased in the sources it used, which destroys its credentials and credibility to someone who looks at it objectively and scientifically. The part in his article that I do agree with is unconscious \textbf{racism}, which is a media issue created to deepen racial divides.3) Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development: Housing Discrimination Against Racial and \textbf{Ethnic} Minorities 2012. [LINK]  This statistic pulled from the article by the video is picking and choosing. If you read the entire article it supports that blatant discrimination, such as this video suggests, has dropped dramatically and is nearly non-existent, but some forms of indirect discrimination exist. However, to claim that all home purchasing minorities are experience \textbf{racism} at 17 rates is misleading without looking at the article as a whole and discussing its findings.4) The Sentencing Project Uneven Justice: State rates of Incarceration by \textbf{Race} and \textbf{Ethnicity}. [LINK] To simply state that blacks are incarcerated 6 times the rates of white people are is another misleading statement. This is more of a political topic in which we delve into why more crime is committed by blacks than whites, thus substantiating the statistic this video used without discussing the reasoning behind it. To simply throw it out there and claim \textbf{racism} is ignorant and biased in and of itself.5) New England Journal of Medicine: Effect of \textbf{Race} and \textbf{Sex} on Physicians Recommendations for Cardiac Catheters. 1999First of all why are we claiming \textbf{racism} in 2015 by citing an article done nearly two decades ago in 1999...Second, the statement the video made "\textbf{doctors} did not inform \textbf{black} patients as often as white ones about an important heart procedure" is another generalization and misleads people. Actually read the article, even though it is nearly 20 years \textbf{old}, and see how they did their study and what their findings were as a whole. Don't make a broad misleading statement to support that it attests to \textbf{racism} today.5) Yale University Field Experiment on State Legislators. [LINK] As stated before, the same author from this article co authored the first source, and wrote the second. Using one person as a source for at least 3 of your citations in your video completely destroys any credibility you're trying to portray. The entire video is biased, makes generalized statements without looking at actual facts, and claims \textbf{racism} today without using viable current studies.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Ethnic, Ethnicity, Old, Race, Racism, Sex, doctors & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}19/632 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.006 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Joshua Worthington 1) University of Chicago Field Study in 2003 for hiring \textbf{black} sounding names.So all we have is something like an abstract of this study. Did you click the bottom of the page where it said "Request a copy of this article"? No? I did not think so. You are seriously grasping for straws by assuming that somehow because "specifics of the resumes concerning qualifications" are not known, you can imply that this article is useless. You would have to be arguing that the study's author is hiding something, which means you've descended to the logical fallacy of the ad-hominem attack.2) New York Times Economic Review: Racial Bias Even When We Have Good Intentions. 2015The same author was behind this and the UC Field Study? That just means that he's the only one interested in this subject of study. If you read scholarly academic papers published in prestigious journals, when trying to make a point, serious scholars will freely use more than one publication from the same author in their resources. It does not destroy credibility, at least not according to every university on earth, ever.Once again, you are implying an ad-hominem attack on the study's author rather than the content of the study itself.3) Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development: Housing Discrimination Against Racial and \textbf{Ethnic} Minorities 2012."If you read the entire article it supports that blatant discrimination, such as this video suggests, has dropped dramatically and is nearly non-existent, but some forms of indirect discrimination exist."This just shows your lack of understanding of what \textbf{racism} is. You only count blatant \textbf{racism} as \textbf{racism}, but the Youtube video never played by these rules. Thus you are using the logical fallacy of the straw-man argument. The video even shows that "racial bias" exists "even when we have good intentions," meaning that unconscious bias is taken for granted by the video to be \textbf{racism}. Unconscious bias is still a judgment based on \textbf{race}.The video does not suggest otherwise. The realtor is not being hostile but dismissive of the home, and does not suggest blatant \textbf{racism}. 17 racial disparity is not "some" \textbf{racism} but a heck of a lot. It is preventing \textbf{Black} people from having access to assets which helps them escape from bad neighborhoods, where they dwell in, then to have white and middle-class Blacks look down on and say "it's their culture that is causing these problems." So what America does is, keep 'em in the  ghetto via housing discrimination (including heavy unconscious bias on what \textbf{Black} people can and cannot afford) and then condescend to them for their "negative culture" of the ghetto. That's so unfair.4) The Sentencing Project Uneven Justice: State rates of Incarceration by \textbf{Race} and \textbf{Ethnicity}. [LINK] This you deny with the flick of a wrist. You say it is misleading but do not back up your claim, except to vaguely say it is "political" issue and therefore not \textbf{racist}. Um, excuse me? Like there are these neat little boxes with no intersection? Look at the Department of Justice Reports for Ferguson, Miami, Newark NJ, and the other cities it investigated. The DOJ finds clear patterns of racial disparities by the police. But I bet that you have another ad-hominem attack coming for the DOJ, saying it is "political," despite the fact the DOJ sided with Sanford County in the trial of George Zimmerman and Ferguson in the trial of Darren Wilson.5) New England Journal of Medicine: Effect of \textbf{Race} and \textbf{Sex} on Physicians Recommendations for Cardiac Catheters. 1999Another source you mysteriously don't give a detailed rebuttal to. I read the article myself and there is \textbf{nothing} too complicated in there, only the question of whether the racial bias was conscious or unconscious, which doesn't matter for it to count as \textbf{racism}. "Our finding that the \textbf{race} and \textbf{sex} of the patient influence the recommendations of physicians independently of other factors may suggest bias on the part of the physicians. By having actors pose as patients, clothed in an identical manner and having identical insurance and occupations, we removed the effects of differing socioeconomic status and insurance from our experiment. By providing the actors with identical scripts, by having them present in hospital gowns under identical direction, and by creating the program in a fixed format, we removed the effects of differences in the presentation of clinical symptoms by patients from our assessment. "6) Yale University Field Experiment on State Legislators. [LINK] yet another ad-hominem attack and vague reference to the idea they were picking and choosing from the article. Why don't you tell us what they left out, hmm?I looked at the link and it seems to me that you are incorrect in saying the Youtube video did anything misleading. The study says: "We find that the putatively \textbf{black} alias continues to be differentially treated even when the emails signal partisanship, indicating that strategic considerations cannot completely explain the observed differential treatment." Am I missing something?The 2000's and 2010's were not that long ago!Here is a study on \textbf{racist} hiring practices from 2014-  [LINK] Here are some studies on how \textbf{doctors} discriminate against Blacks- [LINK]  "\textbf{Black} Children Less Likely to Get Pain Meds in ER" [LINK] "Minorities get less treatment for their pain: a growing body of research shows suffering is not colorblind."\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Ethnic, Ethnicity, Nothing, Race, Racism, Racist, Sex, doctors & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}24/897 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.676 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Shep Glennon America had an opportunity to prove it was post racial after the election of Barack Obama, but all it did was expose a lot of people who claimed they were no longer prejudiced, but in reality had only repressed it because overt \textbf{racism} had become to be viewed as representing \textbf{nothing} but an expression of the ugly past.  The elitist \textbf{racist} didn't want their acquaintances to think of them in the terms of those in the past who carried on that kind of ugliness, say for instance the notorious Bull Connor the bigoted former Police Commissioner of Birmingham, ALA. who set dogs and fire hoses on children and teenagers.  No they even pretended to have \textbf{black} friends, but selective \textbf{black} friends who had the wherewithal and resources to escape poverty and the new norm of institutionalize \textbf{racism}.  They've even seduced some of those \textbf{black} people into agreeing with their false philosophical conservatism   Obama's soaring rhetoric and charisma frightened them and so they've endeavored mightily to marginalize his presidency and the accomplishments he's managed to achieve in the face of their now open contempt for him.  Its fortified those who never had an inclination to repress their \textbf{racism} and the ugliness of it has bubbled to the surface once more and many have transformed themselves into articulate versions of Joe McCarthy, Bull Connor, Governor  Faubus, Governor Wallace, Governor Lester Maddox.  And as usual one can see it is more intense here where I live the woebegone south where poverty is equally devastating to white southerners.  It's truly sad being a white resident of the south knowing the price we've always paid for the sin of \textbf{racism} which our section of the country has always embraced.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Daniel Laparra Hi. I don't know if you were trolling with these comments, but I will still take the time to answer a few of them. I don't know from which country you come from, but I'm guessing you don't come from a european country which has a "great" history of colonising Africa. I am, I'm French. In school we learned probably better than you what my country did and still does in Africa. I think you have no clue what colonisation really was to say that the West "bettered" Africa.True, there were not only downsides to it, France did a couple good things in Africa during and after the colonisation. But for the overwhelming majority of what we did, we stole natural ressources, enslaved a large portion of the population, installed and still install from time to time brutal dictatorships in the region, destroyed the economy/political stability of \textbf{African} countries who wanted to use their natural ressources to help their people, closed our eyes and to a certain extent backed up a genocide, created the \textbf{racist} ideology (yes \textbf{racism} as an ideology originated from France) to justify our actions, went to war with sometimes disastrous results with countries who wanted to rebel against colonisation (c.f. Algeria), the list goes on and on.I'm not at all saying that as an insult, but I suggest you inform yourself on what colonisation really was. Reading a few books on the subject should make you understand why what you say is nonsence. \textbf{African} people were a lot more happy before the colonisation and before the post-colonial era in which fascist dictatorships flourished all over Africa.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}4/274 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.46 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Jason Melo Hall They posted the sources in their video. I actually looked them up.1) University of Chicago Field Study in 2003 for hiring \textbf{black} sounding names.      [LINK]      First of all, this field study was done from 2001-2002 which makes it 13 years \textbf{old} when published. Using one source to claim that \textbf{racism} is vastly apparent in the workforce of today that is over a decade \textbf{old} is just plain silly and misleading.     Second, while this study seemed to support a trend towards racial discrimination in all backs, it becomes extremely difficult to truly compare their findings. We do not know just how many people the employers called as a whole, nor do we know the specifics of the resumes concerning qualifications. All we see from this article are the generalizations used in their studies and the findings they claim to have found through their methods.2) New York Times Economic Review: Racial Bias Even When We Have Good Intentions. 2015     The author that wrote this article is the exact author from the previous source. He paired with Marianne Bertrand to co-author the 2003 Chicago Field Study. Using him in two of your sources for \textbf{racism} is biased. He even cited the Cardiac Catheterization from 1999 and the 2011 Yale University field experiment with state legilators which I'll get to in a bit. The sources being used are all from the same person, this video is extremely biased in the sources it used, which destroys its credentials and credibility to someone who looks at it objectively and scientifically. The part in his article that I do agree with is unconscious \textbf{racism}, which is a media issue created to deepen racial divides.3) Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development: Housing Discrimination Against Racial and \textbf{Ethnic} Minorities 2012. [LINK]  This statistic pulled from the article by the video is picking and choosing. If you read the entire article it supports that blatant discrimination, such as this video suggests, has dropped dramatically and is nearly non-existent, but some forms of indirect discrimination exist. However, to claim that all home purchasing minorities are experience \textbf{racism} at 17 rates is misleading without looking at the article as a whole and discussing its findings.4) The Sentencing Project Uneven Justice: State rates of Incarceration by \textbf{Race} and \textbf{Ethnicity}. [LINK] To simply state that blacks are incarcerated 6 times the rates of white people are is another misleading statement. This is more of a political topic in which we delve into why more crime is committed by blacks than whites, thus substantiating the statistic this video used without discussing the reasoning behind it. To simply throw it out there and claim \textbf{racism} is ignorant and biased in and of itself.5) New England Journal of Medicine: Effect of \textbf{Race} and \textbf{Sex} on Physicians Recommendations for Cardiac Catheters. 1999First of all why are we claiming \textbf{racism} in 2015 by citing an article done nearly two decades ago in 1999...Second, the statement the video made "\textbf{doctors} did not inform \textbf{black} patients as often as white ones about an important heart procedure" is another generalization and misleads people. Actually read the article, even though it is nearly 20 years \textbf{old}, and see how they did their study and what their findings were as a whole. Don't make a broad misleading statement to support that it attests to \textbf{racism} today.5) Yale University Field Experiment on State Legislators. [LINK] As stated before, the same author from this article co authored the first source, and wrote the second. Using one person as a source for at least 3 of your citations in your video completely destroys any credibility you're trying to portray. The entire video is biased, makes generalized statements without looking at actual facts, and claims \textbf{racism} today without using viable current studies.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Ethnic, Ethnicity, Old, Race, Racism, Sex, doctors & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}19/636 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.987 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Joshua Worthington Thanks for sharing your extra research. I figured some were a bit misleading, but I wouldn't say that 10-15 years would make a scientific research obsolete. As it took 40 years to get from the 60s to the state when he cited the information I doubt that \textbf{racism} that existed while these studies took place did not completely eradicate itself in 10-15 years. Also, you make a good point that two of the sources are from the same researcher, which a good thing to note, but he does have 6 sources in all which rounds out his evidence.

I disagree that 10-15 years are still valid today when what the video author is claiming is in the spotlight. If the terms he used in the video weren't so generalized in favor of \textbf{racism} I could agree with you, but there are so many more contributions to racial inequality than blatant \textbf{racism} of whites. the Department of Housing research wasn't what I felt was misleading, it was picking a specific statistic from it and claiming broad \textbf{racism} today without taking into consideration the findings of the project as a whole. That is my issue with this video, they made blanket statements and cited specific findings, going up to nearly two decades ago. My whole point is that there are so many elements to the perceived racial inequality and that many simply attribute it to white \textbf{racism}.
