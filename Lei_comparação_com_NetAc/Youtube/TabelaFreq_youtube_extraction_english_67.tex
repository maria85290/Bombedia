  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I salute America Uncovered for providing a reasonably straightforward brief of the 2018 Open controversy.  Admittedly, Serena's heated emotions were on full display, but let's examine a small measure of her 20 year career that could shed some light, but not necessarily excuse such passion.  The 2001 \textbf{Indian} Wells incident where a then 20-year \textbf{old} rising star endured behavior so unkind she boycotted the event for over a decade.  Or perhaps the 2004 U.S. Open tournament quarterfinal loss against J. Capriati which gathered more attention for erroneous calls against her which existing technology easily confirmed were wrong, not to mention the unfounded accusations of match fixing given voice by names within the game such as John McEnroe or fellow player Elena Dementieva.  Suffice to say, Serena is no stranger to unjust treatment by officials, competitors, or fans on random occasion.  Regarding double standards, she raised a valid point.  During the 2019 U.S. Open, Russian player D. Medvedev covertly offered a vulgar gesture to the crowd, rudely snatched a towel from a ballperson, openly insulted an umpire, and contemptuously tossed his racket toward center court.  He was fined a whopping total of \$9,000.00, versus Serena's \$17,000.00 in 2018.  The outburst served as no more than a temporary distraction and to state it ruined Osaka's moment is completely arbitrary.  Two unequivocal points to bear in mind: (1) Osaka raised the 2019 U.S.Open Championship trophy over her head, not her opponent.  (2) A winner's check of \$3.8M bore her name and no other.  As added rationale, during post-match activities Serena supported Naomi during her moment of triumph in front of a largely pro-Serena crowd, imploring the crowd to cease booing the young champion.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Indian, Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - Native-American & \cellcolor{green!27}2/280 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.714 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Because she's a \textbf{woman}...So, her argument is because the tournament officials sided with the male judge, they are inherently sexist?  I don't blame her for being upset over taking a coaching penalty. Maybe she should be upset with her coach?

I say bizarre because she's experienced enough to know about tennis' step wise escalation of code violation. She got a code violation each for receiving coaching, then smashing the racquet and finally the last argument where she called the umpire a thief.  Third code violation earns a game penalty.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small It's just sad that this all overshadowed Naomis win. Naomi completely thrashed Serena in the first set and in my opinion would have won the match even if Serena hadn't lost a game. I believe that Serena truly believed she didn't deserve the coaching penalty as she didn't see the hand gestures, but after that needed to let it go instead of continuing to bring it up several times after. She absolutely deserved the point penalty for breaking her racket. However, calling the umpire a thief doesn't merrit a warning and definitely doesn't merrit a game penalty. If a man can't handle getting called a thief by a \textbf{woman} he needs to grow a pair lol. if  he really was insulted by being called a thief and a liar he should have overuled and just given another point penalty rather than a game penalty as it was a final and to close to the end of the match.

And I guess the one thing I feel is missing not just from Serena here, but plenty of people who have achieved greatness, is there is no shred of humility to admit that maybe there was an over reaction and that maybe jumping straight to \textbf{sexism} was a bit much, but as far as I know there has never been anything of that sort to come from this. Being able to accept and admit your mistakes is a key to continuing progress as an athlete but even more so as a human. I'm sure at some point in her career she had that and I guess I could probably cut her some slack because I have no idea what it is like to be rich and famous and even more than that to be the absolute best. So I can see how that might be a big factor in the ego and outburst, but I still really hate to see when a prominent and inspiring figure misses a great chance to set an example for the people that admire them by showing some incredibly reputable human traits like humility and redemption. Admitting mistakes has fallen out of fashion and that leads to stagnation and I think it plays a big role in society as a whole.

It was too hot in the kitchen for too long lol.If Serena didn't win this tournament she would have to start alllllllll oovvvveerrrr again at the Australian and time is not her friend.  She got \textbf{age}, motivation, motherhood, an off season to manage and all these new fearless, strong, big ball hitting whippersnappers who are not intimidated and have far less to lose and let's not forget the regular cast of spoilers too.She needs two more to pass Margaret.

And then awarded the penalty.How much abuse is an umpire supposed to take without being speciously accused of \textbf{sexism}? Ramos showed amazing restraint probably BECAUSE Serena is a \textbf{woman}. If a male player had behaved like this, Ramos surely would have called a code violation long before.Another telling moment is when she breaks her racquet. She flinches in case the racquet bounces back and hits her. This shows (a) she is not out of control, she is aware of the consequences of what she is doing, even in the minutia, and (b) she has done this many times before and instinctively knows what happens. This is a clear giveaway of her intentions and her state of mind. It appears every bit as if she is deliberately stalling, trying to interrupt her opponent's concentration and to intimidate the umpire or at least challenge the umpire's authority by "double-daring" him to award a code violation.She's losing. She knows it. Like all great champions she has a healthy dislike of losing.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The analysis ist mostly fair, but it fails to point out clearly why Serena was docked a game after continuing to hassle the umpire: he docked a game solely because calling him a liar and a thief was her THIRD code violation during the match after the illegal coaching and her subsequent raquet breaking. If it would've been her first or second violation, he wouldn't have docked a whole game. Serena is right: men have indeed called umpires far worse many times and haven't been docked a whole game - but this was simply because they hadn't accumulated three code violations,  after they had insulted the umpire. They knew when to shut up. Serena didn't. That's all. No \textbf{sexism} at all triggered this unfortunate escalation. When Andy Roddick said on Twitter that he has called umpires far worse without getting a game penalty, he hadn't thoroughly analyzed Serena's specific situation. Andy simply hadn't accumulated three code violations after  he had insulted an umpire with foul language. The umpire acted totally within the existing rules in Serena's case.

I thought an umpire was a judge and discretion and case by case judgement are applicable to the day and situation. In a court room a judge can hold you in contempt (with probable cause) if you give them a reason OR guess what...they DON'T have to. The idea is why tempt it. Why bash and shit on the individual who can JUDGE rather or not you're being out of line in that very moment and invoke a penalty against you. And even then --- PERSONALLY ---- I'd rather be called a chicken shit or a wanker or a fucking idiot than to be called a sexist. The former statements are made out of just anger. The latter statement isn't just made out of anger. Its an assault on my character. \textbf{Nothing} is more insulting than having your very nature attacked --- especially when you're just doing your job. The only way you could systematically prove this MAY have been sexist is to gather up all of code violations based on abusive or derogatory nature and tally how much of it is female player to male umpire and male player to male umpire.

Her 2009 US Open final blowup had a \textbf{woman} chair but still Serena went as far as to threaten the lines person with shoving a fucking tennis ball down her fucking throat for calling foot fault on her, so you see we have Serena getting out of hand because things were not going her way. The match was over when the female chair umpire gave a point deduction on match point, well \textbf{race} came into play because the chair umpire was white and the lines person was Asian. You see where I'm going with this, unless there's some glaring proof where do you stop blaming \textbf{race}, religion or \textbf{sex} for the outcome of umpiring? And if a male player was to say the same thing Serena said to a diminutive female lines person about shoving a ball down her throat, he would have effectively ended his career and never heard the end of criticism, so yes I can see \textbf{sexism} in that instance because Serena has gotten a free pass for that one.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Colored, Race, Sex, Sexism, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}6/240 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.5 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small As posted elsewhere.Basically, Serena is full of her own self importance and deserved everything she got. She is an insult to everything she claims to stand for and has set so many things backwards because of her petulance and infantile hissy fits.I have been complaining quite a lot recently about tennis stars acting like they owned the world, instead of them owing the world everything. A prime example was Djokovic, who I suspect has been put firmly in his place by all around him because he is now acting more like an adult and not a spoilt 6 year \textbf{old}.Did you see the match when a kid couldn't understand when he was called out and penalised for hitting a ball into a  chair umpire's eye and injuring him "because everyone does it". And that is what Williams and her ilk are responsible for. She should be ashamed of herself and apologise to the world.fyi I have read and watched reactions and reports from around the world and the telling thing is that the only country where Williams gets support is the USA, which is also an indictment of the sorry state the USA has sunk into.I remember JFK with his 'My fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.Trump, Williams et al : "My fellow Americans, ask not what you can do for your country, ask how much your country can subsidise and support you, whilst you avoid doing anything remotely meaningful in life.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}1/261 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.383 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Common Man, especially agree with disappointment of Billy Jean King's statements. However, over the recent years she has been revealing more and more of her feminist-sexist attitude. Wish Bobby Riggs or someone else had beaten her then. Anyway she is an embarrassment to having the USTA Tennis Center with her name on it. Especially compared with Rod Laver in Melbourne is a true representative of tennis and would not attempt to use his credentials to further political agenda or false social agenda; Though Martina Navratilova's social media statements support Carlos Ramos and state the conduct and behavior of Serena was incorrect, still she stated about inequality of judgments across tennis, which is not correct though there are some variances, but so do every sport-game. It is normal, because of humans vary. Am actually more disappointed with Chris Evert, especially she was commenting on the match, and during the broadcast states the issues of Serena's conduct and behavior. Then on social media states that Carlos Ramos went overboard. That is clearly two-faced. Secondly, would expect she would actually know the Regulations, but her social media statements show her ignorance; Martina's statements confirm her knowledge of the Regulations. Billy Jean King seems to ignore the Regulations and states her opinions based upon her pre-supposed, premise of Feminist-SJW, PC type mindset. And Patrick McEnroe, former head of USTA is another embarrassment, also showing his ignorance of the Regulations. So is Katrina Adams a similar embarrassment. Seem time for a replacement to get balance in their. Katrina at the award ceremony clearly showed bias toward Serena. It was disgusting, appalling, disgraceful. See how different she was last year with Sloane Stephens. Indications she is a racist-SJW type, though not absolutely clear. Nonetheless, under Katrina's direction there has been degradation and there needs to be a turn-around. They could have supported Naomi Osaka. They also have not much going in the Men's area so far either. There are so many foreigners who specifically move to the USA for tennis development and training, and maintain their country affiliations. That is fine, just shows, there is among the best training, development available but not very many USA citizens. The women do have many rising often, not many stars from the bunches yet. Some more promising currently, we will see. Of course, which other sport other than professional tennis can a \textbf{woman} excel and achieve large amounts of money. Do not have to even be 1 nor GS winner to get high levels, though the bigger amounts come with either or both. For men, there are numerous other sport-games for athletes to choose.

Hell her forehead slopes back just like the guy's narrating in this video and her eyebrows are as thick as his too.

Even now some people believe this nonsense, unfathomable! Imagine if she played against a white man, the umpire would have been fired by now. This shows the hypocrisy of people who see world through their own lenses and isolate themselves from reality. Want to tell me Fabio Fognini was discriminated against because he was secretly a \textbf{black} female? Mouratoglou himself, Serena's coach admitted he was coaching her. She is a disgrace, Serena should be punished and Naomi compensated from being robbed of her victory.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}5/129 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.876 \\  \hline

Just look at the ads before and during the entirety of the U.S.Open...it went something like this...Don't call it a comeback because I've been here before and no matter how much she wanted it and how much the sponsors thought that she was a shoe-in to win, she lost plain and simple. How does one make a big fuss hoping to change the outcome of the match and go so far as to slander and ridicule a very good chair umpire.The fine should have been much,much bigger.Let's see how much she is booed at the Australian Open in January.People pay huge money for these seats and don't need such childish outbursts.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I understand you tried your best in keeping this video as unbiased as possible, and you did really well, but you missed a trick! When you mentioned the other male players that have "clashed" with Carlos Ramos, you said they didn't get penalised, but they did. If you read the articles you showed us, they clearly state "The serb got a time warning violation" ; "I say towel out loud and I get a code?" ; " [...] before deciding to dock Nadal a first serve".The point here is that Serena accumulated code violations for multiple infractions. And just like in soccer,  where you can get sent off for a not so severe foul by accumulating \textbf{y\textbf{e\textbf{llow}}} cards after a series of fouls, in tennis you can get bigger consequences like game penalties after accumulating code violations (Serena lost a game after her third code violation). A fourth code violation would see her lose the match by default, just like it happened to John McEnroe at the Australian Open. So it's not a matter of \textbf{sexism}, or \textbf{racism}, or anything. It's a matter of Carlos being very strict with the rules and enforcing them regardless of the player's \textbf{race}, \textbf{sex}, or even status. He's not afraid of penalizing the biggest players like Serena, Rafa or Novak.

Then she brings her kid into it, playing that card was low. Her kid has \textbf{nothing} to do with the match, there is no reason to bring it up. Then the \textbf{sexism} accusation and saying that he'll never ref her court again? Now she is just being mean because she doesn't have any basis for that claim, (do you think she knows his history of calls enough to make that claim? Personally I do not.) and to threaten the man's job because of her entitlement that the sport has given her?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I felt incredibly sorry for Osaka. Her win was sullied by all the controversy and the audience should be ashamed of themselves for treating a young \textbf{woman} that way. It's a high-pressure environment and it is no wonder that players lose their cool on occasion. Serena would be better off owning it and apologising profusely to Osaka for not being the idol the young \textbf{woman} had dreamed of playing. It was uncomfortable to watch and a very disappointing display of a star losing her cool and making matters much worse than they should have been. It seems to me rules were clearly broken and penalties were correctly applied but it needs to be the same across the board. Being strict with everyone, men and women alike would hopefully improve court conduct all round but at the end of the day, we are all just human beings and when emotions become involved in such a high-pressure situation, it must be so very hard to keep your cool 100 of the time.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Hyper Hurricane the issue is, yes those things are all nice and good hearted but it's literally expected of millionaires to do this. Sports players, musicians, actors, hell even youtubers do it now. All of these careers are inflated with money and make way more than they ever deserve for what they do. Yes they can all be stressful jobs but do they make the world go round? No. If each of those careers died off the world would keep going. They get paid shit tons to do what is known as a hobby. So it kind of dims down these "amazing things they do" when they can literally wipe their ass with money because "I hit ball good" or "I catch ball good". Not saying what they do isn't amazing at times. It's just a cash cow product and they really serve no importance. So yeah it's kinda expected of them to do these things since the normal people with normal jobs can't throw that much money around. It is funny you throw \textbf{race} into it though as slowly but surely all through the "white male privilege" you all like to screech about, being a white male is becoming shitier to be as literally anything you don't agree with or do can be labeled as \textbf{sexism}/\textbf{racism}/any kind of ism the victimized can come up with. Their opinions are thought of as null and void on any topics even if it is to further the ending of such issues. And while there are many forms of \textbf{racism} and \textbf{sexism}, women and \textbf{colored} people are becoming just as if not more guilty of it now. They just like to create their own rule called the "I'm not white or male so i can't be it" rule.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small For anyone that thinks that Serena (and hundreds of other athletes from ALL pro sports) isn't a "cheat", read on... Most top athletes are "cheats", it's just that they manage to do it "within the rules". The biggest culprits in tennis would seem to be Serena, Venus and Nadal, though it happens in ALL professional sports. There is a system in pro sport known as TUE (Therapeutic Use Exemption), which allows pro sportsmen/women to have otherwise illegal performance enhancing drugs prescribed to them. What they do is tell their personal doctor that they are ill, the doctor then fills out a TUE form stating the illness and the drugs required to treat it and hands the form to the sporting governing body. The sporting governing body then ok's the use of the drug requested for the time period requested. This is a system that has been abused by most top sports people in almost every pro and Olympic sport for many years. The higher profile athlete you are (and all high profile athletes have their own personal \textbf{doctors} making it even easier because the doctor will back up their claim of being ill) the more likely the governing body will say yes to the use of otherwise illegal performance enhancing drugs. This system has remained secret to the public until a couple of years ago when the WADA database was hacked and hundreds if not thousands of previously confidential TUEs were downloaded and made available for all to see. Journalists got hold of the forms and both Serena and Nadal were interviewed about their prolific and in Serena's case almost constant use of illegal performance enhancing drugs and all both could say was "I have done \textbf{nothing} wrong, everything I've done is within the rules". In Serena's case I personally looked through all her TUEs and cross referenced the drugs she took and the times that she took them and I was astonished to find that they almost always coincided with the major slams. In fact on quite a few occasions she was taking hard-core performance enhancing drugs (officially for a particular ailment) from between 6 and 2 weeks before some of the grand slams dating back to 2009 and when I researched the particular drugs she was using, they didn't have an effect on the athlete until 2 weeks AFTER adminstering ended. In other words, she was reaping the performance enhancing benefits just as the tournament started and throughout it's 2 week duration. This I found to be a recurring feature in her TUE strategy way above any other athlete from any other sport. I'm sorry to burst your bubble (I was devastated and very upset for days when I realised the truth behind ALL pro sport) but these are the hard facts. Let's not forget that we live in a capitalist society where profit comes above all else and the bottom line is that top athletes bring a HUGE amount of money into their given sport and thus the governing bodies constantly allow these TUEs to be granted, especially to the biggest names because they bring in the most money - also the use of drugs (particularly in athletics) means that at various times world records will be broken, which HAS to happen because that generates greater public interest which in turn generates even more revenue. If world records were never broken interest would eventually wane, meaning less profit. As we saw in the Lance Armstrong case, a governing body will protect a top athlete because they bring so much attention (money) into their sport. In Armstrong's case he was protected for years by the UCI until the evidence became so overwhelming that the UCI eventually had to distance themselves from him to protect themselves. As a lifelong sports fan, it breaks my heart knowing this ugly truth but I'm afraid to say that the whole pro sporting arena is a sham and a charade and just another HUGE, GIANT corrupt industry.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nothing, doctors & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/664 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.301 \\  \hline

The length of her argument is by no means a factor. However, her accusation of Carlos was. Hence she had a point taken in a crucial way.

And she made it to the final  of 2 grand slams. If that is not remarkable idk what is. And gracious is the way Serena treated her opponent  by telling the crowd to STOP booing.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small When I watched the video, I didn't take the boos as being for the umpire but for Serena. They didn't seem to boo until Serena start throwing a tantrum. This is a disgrace when athletes do this. One of the most important things in sports, in my opinion, is sportsmanship. Personally I don't like when players celebrate too much. There shouldn't be more than a few high fives or slaps on the back after a big play. These players are role models. The kids coming up are having enough trouble with being coddled by parents and teachers. It's even worse when their sports heroes throw fits and act like children. Serena made it even worse by playing the \textbf{gender} card. I saw the penalty stats for the past few years and men were penalized more in every category except one. Sometimes they were even penalized double what women were. I would think feminists would be pissed because Serena trivialized their cause by blaming \textbf{sexism} instead of taking responsibility. Then again when did feminists ever want women to take responsibility. They want women to have all the perks of being a man except with all the responsibilities that come with them. They want to be firemen and police but don't want to be held up to the same standards. They want all the high paying and cushy jobs but want the dirty and dangerous jobs to stay majority male. They want equality in marriage but then still want alimony, full custody, and child support. They want to the same as men but then still expect men to pay for dinner and open doors. They want the right to vote but scream when someone brings up the idea that they pay for that vote with the draft like men. They want all this on top of all the perks they get for being women, for example control of conception. They fight against releasing a male birth control pill and absolutely hate the idea of a financial abortion for men. They want to be able to get pregnant even if the man doesn't and then control what happens to the pregnancy. If they decide to keep it even if the man didn't want it, he's required to pay for it. They want to have \textbf{sex} all they want and if the man doesn't meet their expectations afterward, they want the ability to take back consent after the fact. They want to lock a man who sleeps with a minor up and throw away the key but if they do it they should get a slap on the wrist, keep their teachers license, or not penalized at all. I went off an a rant but basically they want to have their cake and eat it too. Now that they got everything they've wanted, studies show they've gotten progressively more unhappy over the years. Also, more men are staying away from women because of all of the pitfalls of dating in a feminist culture. This cause all the good men to abandon ship leaving only the weasel male feminist types who will do whatever to get laid and the women cry about 'where have all the good men gone?'. Well you drove them away. Because of all this men are relying on porn, prostitution, or \textbf{sex} robots and women are trying to shut that down. Some countries are even trying to institute a bachelors tax to force men to go back to women. Basically they'll do whatever it takes to coerce men into being their slaves. The real victims in all of this are the good women who can't find a good man because of the actions of a few or the real rape victims who aren't believed because of the tons of BS false rape accusations. Or the children who end up being raised without fathers because of these rules or they see their father get ruined and have to hear their mothers constantly tell them their father is a piece of shit. Many of these fathers have killed themselves because they can't take it. This creates young men who don't know how to act like a man. They either find father figures in gangs or they lash out because they didn't have a father to show them how to control their emotions. This is why 85 of inmates came from single mothers. It also creates women who don't have self confidence and don't find good relationships because they didn't have a father to show them what a good man is, Thus creating a vicious cycle of that will ultimately destroy the nuclear family thereby destroying the building block of western civilization which is ultimately their goal. It's one of the main stated goals of all Marxists. The Frankfort school said it, 2nd and 3rd wave feminists said it, and modern day SJWs say it. Jesus H Christ, tell us how you really feel!

I mean, it's not even a issue to be a sore loser since it's normal for elite athletes to always want to win BUT the real problem is not only insulting others, the umpire in this case, but also question the character of someone who's history speaks for itself on how he treats everyone with the same rigorous interpretation of the rules BUT still being fair, that's the problem\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Common & \cellcolor{green!5}Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}1/259 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.386 \\  \hline

And being politically correct means finding \textbf{racism}, \textbf{sexism}, antisemitism etc as soon as one opens his mouth. However, in all fairness, Ramos did bring out the worst out of Serena instead of controling her anger. They were both out of control.

Futhermore what they didn't know is that the referee had to punish Serena BECAUSE of his coach. He was the one breaking the rule, but \textbf{nobody} knew that at that moment even Serena (based on her saying). The referee should have said "I'm sorry u didn't do anything wrong but your coach did therefore following the rule I have to give you a sanction".

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small T NGUYEN,  Your idea is interesting and reasonable for an average umpire, perhaps. However, look at the videos more closely. Clearly Carlos IS responding to Serena's claim in her first retort to his Code Violation-Coaching - Warning. Again after the Code Violation-Racquet/Racket Abuse-Point Penalty Mrs. Williams, when Serena counters with "Warning", Carlos explains again to Serena, which Serena counters, disagrees, begins her onslaught and barrage, during which Carlos responds to Serena several times explaining. We do not hear his words. Also note, Serena after her statement and claim to Carlos about the 'thumbs up' not as coaching but as encouragement 'Come On', she turned away, headed back toward the baseline, after a few steps away turns back toward Carlos shouts something in a strong tone, points her finger at him; Her words are not pickup by the microphones, but her non-verbal indicate something strong, perhaps intimidating-threatening. Her motion is not as strong nor anger was at the \textbf{woman} line judge in 2009, less, but along that line of similarity. Carlos ignores it.Many are quick to say about Carols Ramos known as a 'stickler' or 'strict' umpire. However, Carlos Ramos endures at least three separate onslaughts of verbal abuse. One after each code violation statement and penalty status. Each one is increasingly more abusive, with multiple abuses in each. After the third onslaught and barrage of verbal abuse finished, which contained intimidation, threat, demand of apology, questioning-refuting judgement and correctness, defamation of character ['liar' and 'thief'], did Carlos Ramos rule Code Violation-Verbal Abuse-Game Penalty. The discussion with Tournament Director Brian Earley is not audible [intentionally], but as it completes a few words of Brian saying " ... okay then it's Verbal Abuse for 'thief'. Seems there was much more and maybe agreed to minimize it, else a greater penalty could be assessed as a Major Offence of 'Aggravated Behavior' and disqualification. Perhaps agreeing that with this game penalty, Serena will stop her tirade, the match will be ending soon, and minimize any worse detriment to the tournament, at least the match will complete in a closer to normal proceeding, not by default.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/352 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.284 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small +Deku Heroic - Just so as you know, prejudice means to pre-judge and I'm afraid that's exactly what you have done here with me because not only am I not a Democrat but I'm not even an America either. I might also add too that naturally assuming that I could only be American is quite an insular attitude and in some ways a form of "\textbf{racism}" in itself.The trouble with those on the political right is that they think they have a monopoly on things like condemning crime and upholding law and order, a dislike for overly politically correct attitudes and showing patriotism, probably because they collectively place "the left" in one all encompassing bag. Yet if anyone tries to do that to those on the right and tags them by the most extreme and insane brigade from the right, then they will be the first to protest. Yes there are plenty of liberals and those on the left who like to unjustifiably play the victim via the \textbf{race} or \textbf{sexism} card, yet equally there are plenty of liberals or those on the left who will condemn that because it devalues it when it actually happens. Just as there are plenty on the right who at times will try to unjustifiably explain away any genuinely discrimination of any form, as if none ever exists.Also as a \textbf{black} person, unless you are worth millions and don't really care about others but yourself then voting Republican is like turkeys voting for Christmas if you really think Trump and Republicans value you and have your best interests at heart.Amway, my original point was that it's is total nonsense to say "Liberal is short for \textbf{racist}" as if there is only one kind of liberal, especially when as I alluded to above, the KKK are hardly colourblind and definitely are neither liberal nor of the left of the political spectrum.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Race, Racism, Racist, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}5/319 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.567 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small What is most annoying about Serena is that she is very good at using the strategy she used in this match to break down her opponents. She has done it many times. The anger and injustice that I am sure she actually felt she long ago realised she could use to either get a crowd on her side, fire up her own game and take the rhythm out of the opponent or both. It's called gamesmanship and she, like other superstars who should know better (Neymar, Ronaldo, McEnroe etc..), has tried to cover up her own failings with whataboutism. It's a politicians game. When things are going against you, find a distraction, put your opponent off, take them outside the game and maybe, just maybe you can come out victorious. So \textbf{sexism}? Really. The points were taken from Serena and given to.... a man? Actually, I can't be bothered to get into that side of the debate because that is exactly what someone like Serena wants.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Know the sport before you flap your lips. Williams lost a game because she pushed it to strike three! Williams was in the wrong times three. The rules are well known by the players. Admonishment, point, game, and finally you risk being defaulted. Ask Nick Kyrgios about his meltdown experiences on today's tour when he gets out of line. Ask Nadal about his experience in this year's U.S. Open when he got out of line. Unlike Kyrgios and Williams, Nadal knows when to shut up, be a professional, and get back to competing. is the rule against coaching outdated, probably. But the rule is in place now and Williams knows she is responsible for her team's behavior. Instead of returning to a model of veteran professionalism, she chose to personalize the admonishment and martyr herself to hide the fact she felt she was going to lose. Williams could have pointed at her coach wagged her finger NO! and apologized for his actions. That would have ended it with the referee. But Serena being Serena, she has to blow it out of portion. When she smashed her racquet I knew, from having watched her for decades, that more was coming. She berated the umpire numerous times on a worldwide broadcast. How could he rule anything different? The attempt to demonstrate bias by dragging out decades \textbf{old} tolerated bad boy behavior is silly. How about we use the standards of the 1930s \& 40s? Say Bill Tilden with the world celebrating his tennis excellence while turning a \textbf{blind} eye to his open pedophila. If Nastase, Connors, or McEnroe were to try their antics on today's tour they would be sanctioned just a quickly as Serena Williams. Williams threw the second set away with her actions and paid token pennies in fines when compared to her 2nd place prize money for a very poor performance while robbing a very fine young \textbf{woman} of her golden moment.

She got docked the point because it was her second code violation and a game because it was her third code violation. To say other men players are not similarly penalised is false. If those code violations are their first. the players will only get a warning. How is it no one is speaking on this?

Some have argued that it is up to his discretion and hes not wrong and that the cumulative nature of the sanctions are caution enough, but they all say it was too much, even if he had the right. And that right is very debatable on the first and last sanction. Which you very aptly covered.The fact that there are many men who have done more for extended periods of time is what led to Serena's accusation. \textbf{Sexism}? Who knows, but we do know he has treated men in EXACTLY the same situation differently. Could be \textbf{racism}, could be American hate, could be Serenaism, who knows. But it is undeniably disparate treatment, thus her shock and outrage. The same shock and outrage we see in every sport from highly competitive elite athletes. The Williams sisters ushered in a change in the WTA from dainty tennis to powerful athletic, competitive tennis. When they first overheard volleyed, smashed returns and did body serves it was considered offensive and out of control too. Women's tennis just needs to decide if it wants to be a powerful competitive, sweaty sport or an elegant, country club, social game. Define it. Let everyone know what it is. Set the rules clearly and administer the rules equally. Serena believes she's playing a high level sport and thus is entitled to argue at a high level as all the other helmet throwing, mouth guard throwing, dugout emptying high level players.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Racism, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/266 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.752 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Im sick of hearing "he took a game" an umpire does not have the power to "take a game from her" he only has the capability to award code violations. Plenty of male players have said worse and plenty of players have received code violations for it (that is all an umpire can award) from then on the rules stipulate the penalty given the number of code violations. 1st = warning, 2nd = point penalty, 3rd=game penalty, 4th=game penalty or disqualification. Saying I've never seen an umpire take a game from a man even when they've said worse only means they know to bite their tongue and apply some self-control after the 2nd violation. It's also important to remark most umpires are told their \textbf{blind}, stupid, assholes, retards, that they couldn't tell their ass from their mouth, etc. plenty and they have pretty think skin when it comes to being told things like that but it is rare for a player to attack their character directly, and that rarely ends well. Let's frame it this way, most insults directed at referee reference incompetence, "you are one of these things, therefore, you can't do your job right and cant realize you were wrong on x call" these, most referees will give you a pass on, unless they are especially offensive. Other complaints and insults like the ones in Serena's case refer back to open dishonesty "you know you are wrong on this call and you are doing it on purpose because you're  " these referees don't usually take very well (when was the last time any sports player said "how much did you get paid?" and got away with it?).\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Blind & \cellcolor{green!27}Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}1/279 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.358 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small You're right Eleonora, no one is perfect -- but this was AWFUL!  Osaka was HAMMERING Williams, so Williams and her coach tried to cheat.

So she could blame officiating and "\textbf{sexism}" when she lost, and as an ugly, last-ditch effort to rattle Osaka and steal the match.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I have seen male players lose their shit on the court, break rackets, yell at the umpire and call them names. The differences are these: 1. Anytime a male does that, he is given the appropriate fines2. The top class males (Murray, Federer, Nadal, Djokovic, etc) so rarely do it and when they do they usually simmer down within minutes and get on with the game. So it is easier for the umpire to leave it be. Serena just dragged it on and on and on and wouldn't stop.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small 100 right. I honeslty think the whole serena thing was a mixture of it being Serena and Ramos. Serena is known for having tantrums and losing her cool on the court. As with ANY sport, if you widely known for something then you are far more likely to be called for it. (E.G NHL's Tom Wilson is known for dirty hits, so he gets penalised for hits left and right even when they are perfectly legal ones). Ramos is also known for being stingy with the rules. Male, Female, \textbf{Black}, White or \textbf{Alien}. Ramos follows the rule books very strictly. Mix them together and the chances of what happened happening is so high. Serena got what she deserved. She was way out of line.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Alien, Black & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/124 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.613 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small This was all just sad and unnecessary.  Many tennis fans do love Serena.  She is an unquestionable dominant athlete.  And she is an American, and America has a lot of tennis players and fans.  Unfortunately Serena is often not very likable.  That is something that can, however, be overcome if one is willing to listen to others and make some minor concessions with respect to their outward personality.  She has tried.  She is often gracious to a fault winning AND losing.This display, however, was atrocious.  She acknowledged she'd seen her coach and his gestures, at which point it is the chair's call on whether it was coaching or not.  At that point it's just a warning.  No different than what you get for hitting a ball into the stands intentionally.  She could have just made her complaint and got back to playing tennis.  But she did not.  From there on out, one can only guess what was going on in her head.  She was either really out of control, or she was staging all of it to try to disrupt her opponent.  Both of course reflect poorly on her.  WORST OF ALL, she tried to pin it all on \textbf{sexism}.  And most of the leftist media is trying to spin that as well, fortunately with little success.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small yakitoriPB¬† No... \textbf{racism} is partly to do with superiority and inferiority but also a person's assumption that because of someone's colour they are automatically going to behave in a negative way. Stating that because you are \textbf{black} you are probably a criminal is no different to your statements and even those who are slightly tolerant towards those types of comments would probably judge it to be '\textbf{racist}'. You even say that in your life experience \textbf{black} people are aggressive and violent - which obviously doesn't include all \textbf{black} people. So your assumption, that because a person is \textbf{black} and a \textbf{woman} they will be aggressive, regardless of how you came to that conclusion, is a rather obvious \textbf{racist} statement. But then you double down and your true 'colour' shines through accusing \textbf{black} people of entitlement as if \textbf{black} people somehow have an advantage in this world. You clearly have a problem with \textbf{black} people - regardless of who they are. Bad behaviour is bad behaviour - Serena being an example of a person who behaves very badly and aggressively. But are therefore Sloane Stevens and Madison Keys automatically as badly behaved? You must see how your argument falls apart so easily. So just accept it. You have \textbf{racist} tendencies.

In your next post you might be magnanimous enough to go down to 'many' and if pushed maybe even 'some' - but I have a sneaky suspicion you don't believe that. This is the classic path of \textbf{racism} - the heartfelt comment said in anger comes first - which usually has the \textbf{racist} remarks in them.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small yakitoriPB¬† Yup. Just more digging. Are you not aware that you are trying to defend your comments as not being \textbf{racist} while just continuing to make more such remarks? Are you aware that this is what you are doing? Just curious. Are you an authority on the \textbf{black} community's behavioural patterns throughout the US? Have you got some stats on this entitlement stuff or just a hunch from the handful of examples you claim to have witnessed? You see, this is where the problem lies because if you were an authority on this you wouldn't be saying the above things. This is what ignorance looks like. But maybe your idea of ignorance is different. Maybe you think someone who challenges your personal experience as not being the objective truth is being ignorant in the sense that I, in this case, am ignorant of your specific observations. But that's where you've got it wrong. Your assumption that - let's get this right -  most liberal \textbf{black} American women (so roughly 7 million people let's say) - behave as you say is, by definition, an ignorant assumption. You have no idea if this is true. You also misjudge what is often a \textbf{black} person's sentiment that they deserve an entitlement to equality as someone who is unfairly manipulating history for their benefit. It's like the people who say Obama's skin colour helped him become president when instead he had to overcome this fact to be successful. It's a glaring misunderstanding of history, anthropology, sociology and \textbf{common} sense. In the same way - just because you are making these ignorant comments about the \textbf{black} community does not mean that I will assume that all white people are like that. Because why say something so ridiculous. Are you able to see that your comments only further enforce the notion of the ridiculous?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small yakitoriPB¬† Think the shoe is on the other foot. What you fail to understand is that hiding behind stereotyping doesn't save you in this case. Your comments very clearly state how you see yourself - presumably the white community - as being the 'us' in this comment: 'earn your shit like the rest of us' - thereby clearly putting yourself above 'them'. You are making assumptions based on their \textbf{race} which is different to, say, making assumptions about an Italian whose behaviour will be connected to \textbf{nationality} and the cultural implications that come with that. Stereotyping veers into \textbf{xenophobia} and \textbf{racism} when your assumptions about someone's \textbf{nationality} or skin colour goes towards the judgemental. It's when stereotyping - which is usually things like what food they eat or what hobbies they have or the subjects they speak about - turns to prejudice - which is when you make derogatory remarks about someone's daily behaviour and beliefs and attitude and position in society based on little to no logical reasoning. But there is a different way of testing the nature of your comments. Tell a \textbf{black}, liberal, American \textbf{woman}, next time you meet one, what you have said here and see how she responds to it.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small yakitoriPB¬† OK. The swearing has started. I guess I'm getting through then. Which is a start. And you are only proving my point. You are accusing \textbf{black} people of not 'earning their shit' as opposed to... what? You, personally? So in that case not white people in general but just you are better than \textbf{black} people. That still makes you put yourself above another community based on \textbf{race}.  And I'm not speaking 'for' a group but more about society and our place in it. I'm merely saying that no individual can presume to know what an entire group is like. And I'm saying that what tolerance is - as opposed to prejudice - is the ability to not make sweeping assumptions about a whole community of people based on one's narrow personal experience. It's like assuming that the headline news is the only thing happening at the moment and that one story about one individual should define all - sorry, 'most' other people similar to that person. So what I'm trying to get through to you is that instead of walking around with this automatic association in your mind between the \textbf{black} community and the various derogatory things you have said - be open to the idea that some \textbf{black} women are like Serena (to refer back to the tennis) - entitled, spoilt, sore losers; and others are like Sloane Stevens - dignified, humble and honourable. It is arrogant to presume you have the power to accurately judge others in the way you have. And the word 'racist' will be thrown at you when that judgement includes a \textbf{race}, which yours has. I hope you can see that.  |f you feel the need to swear at me some more go ahead.

The big head decided it was ok to coach her, knowing it was against the rules, and she gets the short end of the stick for his actions.5. Sure,  Serena could have handled it better, but then again, it would have not been necessary had the coach sat on his little hands and let her play.I honestly think she would have been ok with losing the match to her great opponent Osaka, but the issue is not the loss of the match, but the fact that because of a man, she gets punished by a man and then gets criticized by all other men as a \textbf{woman} unable to 'control her temper.'

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small THIS IS SO CLEAR!!  1) The men had an overwhelming majority of code violations overall in the tournament.  2) The 2nd, 3rd, etc code violation for any player DURING THE SAME MATCH will result in a more significant penalty (e.g. warning, point penalty, game penalty...a fact Serena knows "in her sleep!").  3) Her behavior that "she doesnt cheat" is a thinly veiled lie as it implies she NEVER saw the NUMEROUS coaching signals from her box (Now, we all know how often players look to their box --- pretty much after every point? Yeah, I'm gonna stand by that estimate).  So, are we to believe that with her knowledge of the rules,  her unavoidable awareness that her coach was signalling (which he immediately admitted post-match), her decision to NEVER GESTURE TO HER COACH TO STOP (Nadal has done this, for example, MANY, times), that her reactions to the 2nd and 3rd code violations were authentic, sincere, and surprising?  Give me a break: this,  IMO, would constitute an equal insult to Serena's knowledge of Grand Slam rules.  4) Finally, a logical overview of this situation is not a contrast of what men and women get code violations for.   The data is clear:  \textbf{sexism} cannot be supported by the statistical records of Serena 's generation including the ten years previous.   THIS SITUATION IS SIMPLY AND ABSOLUTELY ABOUT A PLAYER "EARNING" MULTIPLE CODE VIOLATIONS IN A SINGLE MATCH --- THUS THE PROGRESSIVE IMPACT OF THE PENALTIES.   SHE KNEW THIS; SHE LOST CONTROL; SHE CHOSE A VERBAL ABUSE THAT HITS SQUARELY ON A SPECIFIED VIOLATION (LIAR, THIEF ----„Äã  RULE: "DISPARAGEMENT.....HONESTY").   SERENA IS A TERRIBLE LOSER!!

They didn't have the type of rules regarding the behavior. The current rules are BECAUSE of their behavior back then. It's all strawman arguments to excuse her egregious behavior.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small UndertaleSkeleBros THANK GOD FOR SOMEBODY THINKING RATIONALLY. Serena's go to excuse is that 'people do way worse.' It's the same excuse she used in 2009. And her comment about male players doing the same thing or worse and getting away with it and not getting a game taken away is completely off kilter. First off, most males have short outbursts but they stop pretty quickly, she kept going on and on. Secondly, most male players yell about the call and they try to argue why they thought the call should have been different, Serena went straight to attacking the character of the umpire, most male players do not do that. And third, yeah make players do this and they DO get a warning, except usually it's not their third warning and the only reasons Serena got a game taken away is because it was her THIRD warning. Most men know when to stop so they don't have that happen and Serena has been pro for 20 years, she knows the rules. And last like you said, it doesn't matter what other umpires have done. She brings it up like men do things worse than her and don't get penalized and that because she got penalized it must be because of \textbf{sexism} but that does not being into account WHO is doing the penalizing. Ramos is known for being a stickler for the rules and he has always upheld them very strictly. There may be other umpires who are more relaxed and who would have let Serena's thing go, but that doesn't matter. What matters is consistency with each INDIVIDUAL umpire to tell if it's \textbf{sexism}. Ramos is extremely consistent.

As in "scared" and/or "guilty" for beating her. This is one of the classic dynamics created within the narcissist field/environment.I'll leave it there.. I'm just tired of seeing her vicious manipulations and people calling it something else...(afraid and intimidated they will be accused of being \textbf{race} motivated) Please, enough of "you wronged me and you owe me an apology" BS. Nope.. you cheated (amazing she used her daughter as a reason for never cheating and having impeccable character...) I mean, just priceless, and it couldn't have happened to a more manipulative FRAUD of a person; who wasted no time to accuse the umpire of being a "thief" (who was right to make the call in the first place) and threatened with taking his job away in future matches...

Then Serena doubles down in the press conference, and the media heads interviewing her were too frightened to call her out on her behaviour, tippy tapping around the subject. Finally, idiots like Billie Jean King seem to think Serena can do no wrong and this really was all about \textbf{sexism} - no calling her out about her behaviour. Thankfully Navratilova at least managed to be more balanced.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small So let me get this straight! Ramos hasn't fined men in the past for their foul mouths, but you state that Serena deserved her because she didn't back down! That in and of itself is a double standard! You're are judging an athletes interactions on nitpick points! Serena didn't tell the umpire to go fuck himself, which several male players have admitted to and not gotten fined. Second, the umpire can decide to give a person a warning, a fine, give set or points or all three. In this case, he decided to give the tripple whammy. Meanwhile, when men play, it is business as usual and the male players can do what they want. I don't mind Ramos having a reputation for being a hardliner! What I take issue with is that he does it more to females than to males! That a player got away with the f bomb or worse is inconsequential in this argument if a person is watching the video. Second, Naomi may play for Japan, but she is also Haitian. She is the victim in this  because she got fallout for Venus's poor sportsmanship and Ramos's sexists calls. That said, I watched the after match interviews with Naomi. I want to call Naomi's BS right here and now! Before I continue, I am not trying to make Naomi responsible for Serena's actions. Let's get this straight. However, what I saw at Naomi's press conference disturbed me. Naomi denied hearing or understanding what the debate was about! Nor did she make any comment about the situation or defend Serena for trying to help her out! WOW! You see Naomi is playing her Japanese kawaii card (kawaii means cuteness) while scheming over the fact that her father is Haitian. You see it's easier for her to do that because the majority make it so hard for people of color! When Naomi performed kawaii, she insulted Serena! Everything Serena is fighting for or has fought for, Naomi along with other players will benefit from. Case in point: Naomi is considered the victim, which should be. Yet, if the umpire association does indeed find Ramos has  been unfair in his handling of matches, he along with others will get a clear message to clean up their acts. Speaking of umpire associations, I don't mind that the UA took supported Remos. That said, the UA should also make it a point to monitor their umpires to insure there is no misconduct on their part. Returning to kawaii, because Naomi plays her kawaii card, her voice is taken from her and she is made into a puppet of what the establishment wants: a person who simply plays tennis and does not demand anything from professional tennis associations who may or may not have her best interest in mind. By staying silent, Naomi may want to appear gracious, polite and sportsmanlike, but the truth is that she hurt women, especially Asian women by living the stereotype of what the public expects out of them: quiet, polite, obedient! Because of these things, the public is more accepting of her and empathizes with her despite the personal slight against Serena, who has been made public enemy number one in all this. I'd love to see what would happen if Naomi was playing for her father's country of Haiti or if Naomi had a bad day and openly argued with an umpire. Would the public be so understanding of Naomi whose homeland is the poorest country and has the highest poverty, AIDS and illiteracy rates? When I see Naomi walking around the ghettos of Haiti, giving tennis lessons, I'll be the first to apologize for under estimating her! Until then, you need to give Serena props for standing up to unfair treatment. That said. I don't like any athlete having tantrums on the court including Serena. It makes them look immature. However, that \textbf{old} game where  Naomi is an angel and Serena the devil needs to end here and now! When Naomi opens her mouth to talk about being treated unfairly is the minute the establish will say she is spoilt and entitled--just like Serena. And this is what Serena and many people want to end so women will be treated equally, because we are not.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}1/712 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.14 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small WOW this video clearly explains all sides, was in-depth, showed the entirety of the situation, and addressed the incorrect sexist angle Serena decided to take, accurately. (Stephen A Smith made a good response video to this incident as well) I've done my own digging and reached the same conclusions this video made, when considering the strict umpire, the code violations, diminishing Osaka's historic victory, etc. I think if Serena was able to discern that the warning for cheating was inevitable, when the ump called it, she could've stayed more focused. I think in her situation I would've reacted the same, b/c I would feel mischaracterized and clearly deny something I'm not doing. But from this strict ump's view the coach made clear coaching signals and she even admitted to seeing a thumbs up. I don't believe Serena the tennis goat would rely on coaching, but the ump operated within the rules. The ump has that luxury to make that call, if she could've taken that as just a warning and moved on I think she would've maintained her composure. Also with that initial warning i think there's a clip where Serena and the ump came to an "Understanding", they both said they understood each other but I think Serena mistook that for the ump retracting the first warning. Which would explain why she got confused about the point awarded after racket abuse. She would've thought that her racket abuse, would be her first warning.This ump is a veteran, well known for being by-the-book, and because she did call him a thief, his third violation was correct. However, since every ump is different, one could argue that this ump could've let go of that 'thief comment' because that third violation would result in a game being awarded, in a Grand Slam final. Not only is that devastating but it rarely happens in Grand Slams, and I think for good reason. Stephen Smith also made a good point that an athlete prepares for the opponent and the ump. There have also been studies that talk about this 'uncontrollable rage' athletes can experience while in the game that may affect their behavior and performance. I think it is wrong/unprofessional for a professional athlete to succumb into this intense emotion, but it can also be very difficult to control this rage. Examples: losing in a video game and breaking your property or when Tyson bit off an ear. It think it starts when someone doesn't internalize their frustration, it can consume them. Its clear she was upset and retained her upset mentality. It made me think of times when I should've let go, instead of holding on to that state of being upset. But I think it's very difficult to realize that.It reminded me of when a teammate of mine in high school football messed up a play and fumbled the ball on a punt return. I've never seen him rage this way, he threw his helmet on the floor before getting off the field and yelled like a maniac. The coach immediately scolded him and benched him for that entire game.I think whether it's a verbal or physical meltdown it's still unprofessional, unsportsmanlike, and a lack of control over emotions from both men or women. Each sport deals with unsportsmanlike conduct their own way, so dont be comparing tennis to hockey.I think in this incident, it was a meltdown. With a physical aspect coming from racket abuse. And the due to the length of her arguing and saying "because she's a \textbf{woman}" (essentially pulling the \textbf{sexism} card) was part of her verbal meltdown.Since Serena mentioned the \textbf{sexism} it became the main point of this incident, along with the perception of men and women meltdowns.Im not denying the existence of \textbf{sexism} in the present or past, but this video mentioned that men received more violations than women and the degree of their arguing was different. Also consider the female vs female match and Osaka not experiencing the \textbf{sexism} Serena felt. This doesn't appear to be a sexist ump tennis issue.I also disagree with people stating that "when it comes to women it's called a meltdown, but with men it's passionate". On one hand, no one said Tyson ripping off an ear was passionate. Most people if not all agreed, that was a disgrace and disgusting. I think people can find examples of both scenarios. Although I would consider both meltdowns, I understand that Tyson bitting an ear off is on the extreme end of the spectrum. Regardless it was still wrong on Serena and she had a meltdown and the aftermath resulted in Osaka apologizing for her victory. I still must credit Serena acknowledging Osaka's win and not saying that the "bad reffing" caused her loss or Osaka's win. Osaka had a momentus victory and as Serena said deserved to win.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Sexism, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}5/814 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.614 \\  \hline

Heard Osaka looks up to Serena to. Is she still a fan after Serena did this? I would not be. Made the crowd turn on her \& booing her when she got the award? Serena says "She stands for women"? yeah right. She did not do much, to support a half japanese-black young tennis player, who looks up to her. Just stands there in the backround with a smirk on her face when Osaka gets booed. She is a very disgusting person. On the inside she is really nasty.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}2/155 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.29 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Yes, Serena is an unprecedented shame for all women, mothers, \textbf{black} people, tennis players and Americans.Additionally, if you read more carefully, Ramos was strict to Djokovic, Nadal \& Kyrgios, they all received penalties too but were clever enough to shut up \& stop making code violations. They did not rant, threaten, abuse. And they certainly would not go to extreme lengths to justify their misbehaviour afterwards. We also need to bear in mind that top athletes have plenty of psychological preparations \& they are well in control of their emotions, that is why they can perform on that level, which implies that it is not just Serena's bad temper what we've seen, but her deliberate display of power.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!5}1/119 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.84 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Serena has had an outstanding career and accomplished many things.  But she is also getting on in years.  You can't win against the 20 year olds forever.  The fact that she is still so competitive at her \textbf{age} is a testament to her outstanding athleticism.But I don't see how a penalty could have been sexist.  That was out of bounds.  It was a \textbf{woman}'s game and Osaka is a \textbf{woman}.  The call perhaps could be construed as \textbf{racist} perhaps, but with Osaka also being a person of color that would also have been quite a stretch.Calling someone \textbf{racist} or sexist in today's world is one of the deepest insults you can level at them, especially if it isn't true.  It's worse than liar or thief for sure, both of which also seem to be unfounded accusations she leveled at the ref.The original call of coaching might not have been necessary but what was the penalty?  1 "point"?  I'm not sure exactly what that means but I think it would be equivalent to losing one serve.  It should not have been a big deal.  Then she smashed her racket, which is unprofessional and cost her another point.  But calling the ref a thief, a liar, sexist, and threatening his livelihood was simply over the top.And anyway even without the penalties Osaka probably would have won.  You can't win them all, not even if your name is Serena.Serena was gracious towards Osaka afterwards though, and that goes a long ways towards me being able to forgive the whole thing as just an outburst due to stress.  She should probably publicly apologize for calling the ref sexist though.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Racist, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}4/280 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.429 \\  \hline

So they are called NORTH Americans.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Serena owes the umpire an apology. She was a disgrace with her whining and carrying on. What an absolute embarrassment of a \textbf{freak} show Serena was. Tried playing the \textbf{gender} card saying that this is only happening bc she's a \textbf{woman}. It was her job to keep track of her penalties. She said that her coach just did a thumbs up and went on a ridiculous clueless rant berating the ump. Then the coach admits he was coaching and the replay showed that the coach was doing a lot more than a thumbs up. Strike 1 and a warning. Then she smashes her racket. 2nd offense and a point is awarded to her opponent. Then she gets all uppity and again starts berating and mouthing off to the ump culminating in calling the ump a thief. The ump had had enough of princess serena's mouthing off and rightly gave her strike 3 for verbal abuse. Game penalty awarded to Naomi. It was serena's job to know that she had 2 strikes and that the 3rd would mean a game penalty but no... she's still all uppity and makin' a jagoff outta herself. She starts blathering about how she's a champion on the court and a champion of issues away from the court. Translation: When she's done with tennis she wants to be some kinda ridiculous left wing mouthpiece, yawnnnnn.... Go fuck yourself you disgrace. You stole the moment from Naomi with your childish tirades where you were WRONG on every aspect and point. Naomi crushed Serena and woulda beat her anyway but jesus christ what an embarrassment.

She's blessed to have such prowess and wasn't expecting much to her current opponent when she started realizing she was starting to lose and that's when she basically used the "sexist" card against the empire.

Out of control behavior has no \textbf{gender}, \textbf{race} or \textbf{nationality}. It happens all the time, but more frequently from some who thinks he or she can get away with it. She was at home, so she felt she was in charge. She played a victim so she could get her supporters to back her up. The lauder them became the more she increased her barrage against a man who was just doing his job. A very good job we must say! Give this real man the \$17,000.00 they collected from the abuser. She went home with more than a million. The penalty to be effective it needs to cause a pain in the pocket of the offender. The penalty amount should be a substantial percentage of what they are taking home. That will stop or decrease this abusive manipulation of the game (which is a form of cheating). This behavior is being used by some dishonest players not only in tennis but other sports as well. Humans will push the limits as long as they are allowed to. With all the attention they are getting for doing what is wrong, they won't be motivated to change. Can we honestly blame them for pushing the rules, if they are being allowed to? The decline in our society's morals is creating more opportunities for this barrage to be tolerated, encouraged, excused, and insanely justified.

Two: She was upset because her and her coach was caught cheating. She claimed she didn't see the coaching yet when she approached the umpire she told him just because her coach has two thumbs up that doesn't mean he is coaching.

The match went the way it went, Serena lost, and that part's not up for debate. She's calling it out in the hope that future female athletes won't be penalized for having passion (which is what we usually call it when a man gets upset, as opposed to "hysterical" or "sore loser" and "out of control").

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I followed Serena from a very long time... If u think she did all this becoz she is losing, i think you should have watched the match, game penalty came when the score was serena 3-4 osaka and serena was the one to serve and the penalty gave osaka a game lead that means serena lost the opportunity to equal the score on her serve, if penalty is not there, osaka needs to break serena serve to get the match. I am saying all these, because i have seen serena coming back even at the last moments to claim the matches. I am saying all these because i have seen djokovic, murray saying things to umpire but never got any penalty. So i think her point is very clear. BTW i am not american, i am an \textbf{indian} and i support serena not because what she won, because of her oncourt grace. If you don't support serena that's absolutely fine but don't say bullshit things to her, because serena lost the match.

Carlos Ramos actually let it go on longer than I have seen some umpires tolerate it. Likely the greatest female player of all time. A good sport and honest? No! Shame of Serena, shame on the booing crowd. It is also interesting to me that \textbf{nobody} called out the USTA (who run the event) for breaking the rules and seating Serena 17th when see was actually 26th  in order to protect her from losing in the early rounds to the top seeds.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Katy O'Neil I agree overall with your comments. The remarks made by Williams don't stand up to scrutiny. The \textbf{sexism} charge is bogus. Look at female tennis players getting the same prize money as men for working fewer hours. Last year a male Italian player got a far worse fine than Williams for his own misconduct with a suspended grand slam ban hanging over him after it. In 1990 john McEnroe was disqualified from the Australian open for his own misconduct. At the us open far more code violations were given against men than women. Williams was not fighting for all women everywhere when she threatened a female line judge before her disqualification against Kim clijsters there in 2009. She should have got her focus back after the first code violation and used her own experience to get back in the match against an inexperienced opponent. Instead she lost her discipline destroying any chance of a comeback. You cannot do that in any sport. Naomi Osaka deserved her victory and the way the presenters and the crowd treated her was a disgrace. In mitigation Williams did not take any of her anger out on Osaka but the poor atmosphere she stoked led to this.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/204 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.49 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Making this about '\textbf{sexism}' was a big mistake on Williams' part. Although it seems more likely from the evidence that she was being coached, there is still a large grey area with regard to that. It's entirely possible that the coach did it on his own, and she didn't use it, instead, realizing how it could be misconstrued, she openly admitted what the coach was doing. On the other hand, she may have been lying to cover it up. Who knows. What is justified is the second penalty. If implying 'dishonesty' about an 'official' is classified as verbal abuse, then she certainly did violate that one. Perhaps she was being treated unfairly at first, but not because of \textbf{sexism}. She just had a disagreement with the official on a judgement call, which happens all the time in sports, but instead of quietly and begrudgingly accepting the decision, she made a big scene and retaliated verbally. That is on her, not the official. Making this about \textbf{sexism} after the fact removes any sympathy I may have had for her. If instead she owed up to the facts and tried to be as accepting of the possibility of how she may be wrong, and then defended her actions, that would look a lot better on her part. Instead, she's being childish and just accusing the person she disagrees with of being a bad person (sexist). That's how a child responds to speech they don't like. Rather than respectfully disagreeing, they call each other names.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/252 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.794 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I think he gave a very fair analysis. I don't know if calling the umpire a thief was what tipped it over the edge for him, but after she started threatening the umpire with "you will never work on the same court as me again", I really wasn't surprised she got the code violation.The point penalty for racket abuse was correct. If you totally break your racket it pretty much always gets you a code violation, for both men and women. If you slam your racket and don't "break" it, they'll usually let those slide. So that's why sometimes players slam their racket and then keep playing with it for another couple of points.And breaking your racket isn't very unusual. But normally players never break their racket after already having 1 code violation because \textbf{nobody} wants a point penalty.When Serena slammed her racket, she 100 knew that she was going to get a point penalty (being the 2nd code violation). Then she wanted the umpire to go back and remove the 1st code violation so she wouldn't get the point penalty. That literally never happens in tennis. She knew this. It's not really fair of her to \textbf{freak} out about that.So her getting that point penalty had \textbf{nothing} to do with \textbf{sexism}. She got that penalty because just lost a game that made it look like she would lose the match and she was pissed.Also, I don't think she should come out looking positive because she tried to salvage the ceremony that she ruined by creating a huge drama right before she was about to lose.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Freak, Nobody, Nothing, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}4/271 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.476 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small It is unfortunate to see such behavior from Serena. This behavior only makes her look as a very bad loser, very weak person, with this episode the respect of her fans and people in general had for her is jeopardized and it will change. The rules apply to everyone, including Serena Williams. The fact that she can't accept that these rules are to be respected is something that she totally disregarded, I though she knew better. It is clear that coaching is not allowed in Gran Slams, period!!! Even Chris Evert while broadcasting this match, said that Serena was watching her coach when he was sending signals to Serena to move to the net. Besides that it doesn't matter if Serena saw the coach coaching her, if the coach is coaching even if the player doesn't see him/her, this is going to get the player a penalty.Who does she think she is? I think Serena is the one with double standard rather than the empire. If she portraits herself as a super champion, an advocate for equality, etc. etc. why can she not back all this up with fairness and intelligence? Why does she expect to be treated differently than any other player, male or female and hide herself in all kind of ridiculous causes that some of them don't merit to even be mentioned because they simply don't make any sense. She is simply an arrogant and weak person trying to convince the world differently. I am a mother of a daughter and son and it was pathetic and embarrassing to see her behavior. Not a role model at all or someone to admire regardless of of her victories, Serena is simply someone too hungry for another Grand Slam and she couldn't bear the possibility that she was going to lose and she took it up on the umpire. Who is the unfair person here, Serena or the Umpire? The rules are there to be applied. I feel sorry for the umpire who is told to apply the rules, but specially the WTA and ATP are backing up Serena, tennis fans are also very disappointed at these organizations for not keeping the sport with high moral standards and double standards like in this situation, they need to put it this together ASAP before they lose more credibility. In a nutshell, it is all about Serena. She didn't think for a minute that she was ruining the entire match, this includes, the real Champion Naomi Osaka, all the spectators, all the fans in the entire world, the tennis world, the young tennis players to name some,I find this absolutely irresponsible and acceptable. Then she tried to console Naomi during the ceremony which is a joke. Serena has received so much credit for this in circumstances that Serena created this horrific situation, but so many \textbf{blind} people are out there that can't see this clear because a lot of them don't know anything about the rules in Grand Slams or they just can't think objectively and without emotions.Serena, this is for you, it is time to retire, there are new gracious champions coming, i.e. Naomi Osaka!!!

Now please tell me who in their right mind is going to defend him?It's easy to yammer about \textbf{sexism} as soon as a man punishes a \textbf{woman} for violating the rules.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small John Smith: Good! Any unbiased person can see whose behavior is in question here. Out of control behavior has no \textbf{gender}, \textbf{race}, \textbf{nationality} or excuses. It happens all the time, but more frequently from some who thinks he or she can get away with it. She was at home, so she felt she was in charge. She played a victim so she could get her supporters to back her up. The lauder them became the more she increased her barrage against a man who was just doing his job. A very good job we must say! Give this real man the \$17,000.00 they collected from the abuser. She went home with more than a million. The penalty to be effective it needs to cause a pain in the pocket of the offender. The penalty amount should be a substantial percentage of what they are taking home. That will stop or decrease this abusive manipulation of the game (which as a form of cheating). This behavior is being used by some dishonest players not only in tennis but other sports as well. Humans will push the limits as long as they are allowed to. With all the attention they are getting for doing what is wrong, they won't be motivated to change. Can we honestly blame them for pushing the rules, if they are being allowed to? The decline in our society's morals is creating more opportunities for this barrage to be tolerated, encouraged, excused, and insanely justified.

She was DEFINITELY CHEATING, her coach even admitted to it so that's why she was docked. Yes, there was 100 \textbf{sexism} taken place, yet again it was on Serena's behalf.

Serena was to be the loser, and by her own actions, she's just a bigger one now. She was a disgrace! For that matter, so are all of the people defending the indefensible.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small You can't blame Serena Williams for her raging while losing - steroids can have menacing emotional side effects. Yes, "'roid rage" is real. Researchers have documented several cases of violent, aggressive behavior associated with anabolic-androgenic steroid use, even athletes with no prior history of violence (according to a paper published in 2010 in the journal Hormones and Behavior). Check out Serena's workout schedule - Jazzercise and running won't produce that body. Serena Williams is often called not just the greatest female athlete but also the greatest athlete period (what a joke). They said the very same thing about Marion Jones who finally admitted to doping. When Serena's coach admitted to cheating because "everyone does it," it sounded a lot like drug use - when you consider the people most likely to have an ADD diagnosis are Olympic athletes (so they can take uppers). Sharapova was caught. \textbf{Nobody} questioned whether Joyner was roided - just too much muscle in too short a time. Cox and White were caught. Thomas's facial hair was too obvious. It's not just the Russians. The other issue is once you start lying, becoming pathological is the natural end result. The claim men have done the same is not accurate. They're rages were short - they were all able to get control of themselves. It was so sad that beating her had to come with an apology from her opponent - not fair. Repeatedly, Trevor claims we should allow athletes whatever is \textbf{common} but then he chokes down almost saying "drugs." Google NFL "excessive rage." Trevor lies. The issue for many is their only source of news is comedians pandering to their biases. Serena did not get the penalty for her childishly slamming her racket but for her non-stop verbal abuse.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Richard Stead said "Tucson Jim you are dead right . STEROIDS."There have been all kind of rumors circulating around men in many sports over the years and even on rare occasions a few women (like Joyner)... why never Queen Serena? Doesn't her completely closed workouts further raise suspicion? We readily accept that men behave poorly but we refuse to suggest that women might ever be held accountable. Serena admits to seeing her coach but pretends she didn't understand the obvious sign to play closer to the net saying it was a "thumbs up" BUT then later lied saying she never saw him. People are saying the ref was incompetent (he wasn't) for going overboard when she called him a "thief" - it was for failing to ever stop her silly tantrum. Trevor's suggesting the problem was destroying her racket is a bold faced lie. He was there - he knows. At no time was she able to control herself like an adult. She uses the victim troupe women have been using forever. I'm a \textbf{woman}, I have a child, won't you rescue me? One might suggest it's unfair to blame Serena since girls are raised to be drama queens. There is \textbf{nothing} more pathetic than when Naomi Osaka was forced to apologize for beating Queen Serena. Shame on the mob for not allowing her to have her moment of glory. :-(And again, just look at real \textbf{woman} Naomi Osaka's body. My mother got a physics degree from Duke with my dad (and got better grades) and was easily able to get a better paying job than he even in the late 1940s. However, they couldn't afford to buy a home so my 5'2 mom volunteered to build it herself (eventually winning the Delco Home award in 1965). She could easily carry four cinder blocks at a time while my 6'4" Navy Commander dad gave himself a hernia trying to carry one. Mom ended working in construction for the next decade. I once saw two larger youths attempt to rob her - she had them both on the ground in seconds. Her body didn't look anything like Serena's. Get real. You are the first person to affirm such an opinion makes sense - I don't get why. I honestly believe women could compete with men in sports. There's no doubt mom could have taken my dad. Bruce Lee proved size doesn't matter. Women just aren't willing to make the same effort. Listen to the other female tennis players talking about how lifting weights would be too much effort... like the male tennis players do. It's the same with surgeons - there's no \textbf{sexism} just women raised with a more "healthy" life  work balance. And oh, studies confirm that just like the guy who claims to do "it" the most usually doesn't at all (and doesn't even like it), those who scream "I never cheat" the loudest are cheating the most often.

Out of control behavior has no \textbf{gender}, \textbf{race} or \textbf{nationality}. It happens all the time, but more frequently from some who thinks he or she can get away with it. She was at home, so she felt she was in charge. She played a victim so she could get her supporters to back her up. The lauder them became the more she increased her barrage against a man who was just doing his job. A very good job we must say! Give this real man the \$17,000.00 they collected from the abuser. She went home with more than a million. The penalty to be effective it needs to cause a pain in the pocket of the offender. The penalty amount should be a substantial percentage of what they are taking home. That will stop or decrease this abusive manipulation of the game (which as a form of cheating). This behavior is being used by some dishonest players not only in tennis but other sports as well. Humans will push the limits as long as they are allowed to. With all the attention they are getting for doing what is wrong, they won't be motivated to change. Can we honestly blame them for pushing the rules, if they are being allowed to? The decline in our society's morals is creating more opportunities for this barrage to be tolerated, encouraged, excused, and insanely justified.

Making assumptions that Serena is a 'man-hating sexist' is ridiculous.

Serena didn't just have a baby because MTFs cannot have children you have to have a uterus and ovaries to have a baby.  The baby was either adopted or is a surrogate courtesy of her husband's sperm.  MTFs (and WTM) do not \textbf{age} well.  Serena is 36 and the estrogen isn't working any longer.  So each year Serena (and Venus) are reverting back into the males that they were when they were born.  Unfortunately, they've had so much plastic surgery done with breast and buttocks and who knows what else, that this will not end very pretty.  Can't you tell by looking at Serena's huge skull?  Her skull didn't look like that when she was a teenager.  Look at the eyebrow ridge, the slanted forehead and jaw line. Women do not have the kind of arm and leg massive skeletal muscle structure that Serena has.  Can you think of any other \textbf{woman} tennis player that was that huge?  Hell, she's bigger than most of the men! Serena is really pissed that the gig is up.  I'd be pissed too.  Serena and Venus never had a choice in the matter.  Their father into the worship of the baphomet and he sacrificed both his two sons for wealth.  He said as much in a magazine.  He wanted out of Compton but was poor.  So he sacrificed Serena and Venus to the baphomet. They were given estrogen from a very young \textbf{age} (Just like Shiloh Pitt is being sacrificed.)  Serena and Venus were castrated before puberty and their penis was made into a "vagina."  Their father is a bastard and should be put in prison.  I'm sure Serena was very jealous of the beautiful young \textbf{woman}, Naomi Osaka she/he played against and that might actually be the reason Serena played so poorly.  Naomi is at the beginning of her career and Serena is at the twilight of hers/his.  Hell, even the referee got to live a more authentic life than Serena and Venus.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small These rules are made by the fucking lawn tennis association, and the international tennis association.

Act appropriately.And it's not that coaches can't coach. In a grand slam, they aren't allowed to coach during the game. In other championships they can, but not in grand slams, they are the pinnacle of the sport and rely on certain sets of rules. These rules have been in place since day one for the most part, and every player who plays knows the rules and agree's to abide by them.They don't have to agree, they can refuse to take part in grand slams if they don't like it. But Serena has been at the very top of this sport for over 15 years, she knows the rules.As you say, you don't like the sport anyway. Good for you. You're obviously just a SJW \textbf{feminazi} demanding everyone change the rules of a sport you know fuck all about. That is fascistic, don't you think?And regardless of whether she agreed with the umpire decision, claiming feminism and claiming "I'm a MOTHER" is just fucking ridiculous, and this is why people hate her.

Kind of renders the rule useless. Not to mention the accusation by Serena's coach, who said that the Japanese coach was coaching more. So, now does the Japanese player get disqualified \& the trophy gets handed over to Serena? Nah. I guess not. \& where does the line of 'breaking stuff' stop? Can anyone rip a towel in half?

Right. Surprised she didn't say it was for the "Children of Africa",or a "dying child" she knew asked her to or some other defense she made up that you're trained to be sacred to say anything against.
