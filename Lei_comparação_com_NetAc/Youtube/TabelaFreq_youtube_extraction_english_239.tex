  \cellcolor{green!27}\small So this post is about Yellowface. However you have people complaining about Netflix casting a \textbf{black} person.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Remember that's it's only bad and \textbf{racist} when you use a white actor on a non-white character; if you do the opposite it is very empowering and progressive and also the story is fictional so why bother with specific \textbf{ethnicity} and color.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/42 & \cellcolor{green!5}4.762 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Am I the only one who doesn't see anything wrong with this. I mean acting is acting. If you cast someone to play the role of a mother or grandmother and they have no children or grandchildren in real life. Isn't it the same thing to cast someone of a different \textbf{race} to play another \textbf{race}? I don't see the problem. Acting is just playing pretend, so why can't you pretend to play an Asian character or \textbf{Indian}? It isn't \textbf{racist}.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I'm half-Korean and I find this concept ridiculous. Sure, it'd be great if Hollywood would cast more Asians. But it's first and foremost a business. They make movies to make money. And they cast famous actors because they are recognizable faces and will get people to go see the movie. It just so happens to be that most American actors are white. I don't know the percentages but I'm pretty sure the majority of Americans are white. But on an artistic level, I don't care what \textbf{ethnicity} the character is.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Well...How often are Caucasians -- or any other \textbf{ethnic} actor -- cast in Chinese-made or Japanese-made or Mexican-made films?  Actors act as all kinds of things -- aliens, animals, robots.  How often have men played drag when many actresses were available?  Young person playing \textbf{old}?  Actors pushing thirty years \textbf{old} playing high school teens?  Are you suggesting actor's should ONLY be cast as "type", as their perceived \textbf{race}, as "themselves"?  Only a housewife could play a housewife?  Only a Native American actor can play an \textbf{indian}?  This is the same argument by actors with disabilities who push for roles that include "Little People" or wheelchair-bound characters.  Hollywood's narratives have been and are based on the world-view of heterosexual, wealthy, \textbf{old}, white, Jewish male producers who initially had lofty ideas about translating written classics (chock full of bigotry for the most part) into populist entertainment and failed, turning to cheap exploitation that panders to stereotypes (as is the case with the new awful film, "Supervised").  Breaking ground starts with a compelling, relatable, universal story and ends with people voting with their pocket book.  Blaming producers/actors doesn't change the bigotry of a culture who thought \textbf{black} face was entertaining and low-brow audiences who are easily distracted by someone who looks "different" in the cast, including white blonde women.  Look no further than Disney and the overly homogenized, yet still sexist, \textbf{racist} and repressive cultural appropriations for the masses for decades have mass produced, who now own the Muppets and Star Wars.  WE, the unquestioning consumers, are the enemy.  When we know better, we'll do better, and we'll lead by example.

And how unfair is it to judge art from the past and call it \textbf{racist} just because it doesn't apply to our standards?Oh, and for Starship Troopers, back the hell off.

In  the netflix deathnote i was disappointed because L in the manga and anime was so damn pale that if they didn't use a japanese looking actor, they could have atleast used a pale person in general, that also goes for Light and all the other characters, but the movie also messed their personalities beyond belief so it would have been doomed anyways.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!5}2/190 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.053 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Its honestly sad that when i think about the Asian representation that affected me when i was young, i think about Mulan. And she's Chinese. Im Filipino. To this day Asian representation is something that a lot of people in the movie/tv show industry neglect because it seems like we don't need it. \textbf{African} American and Hispanic representation has increased over the pass few years, which is amazing and is great progress, however Asians have always been overlooked when it comes to media representation. Why? Because we are the middle ground essentially. We don't have as many disadvantages that \textbf{African} Americans and Hispanic people do in society, but we don't have the same advantages as white people. Asians are stereotypically perfect. Therefore who cares if they get representation? But people fail to realize that representation is important to all cultures. When most people think of Asian, they think rice, cone hats, squinty eyes, and other tidbits from Japanese and Chinese culture. When I started going into a primarily \textbf{African}-American and Hispanic high school this year, i was asked if i was Hispanic (which is fine because i don't look stereotypically Asian and its a broad \textbf{race} of people) or Chinese. I was amazed at how little people knew about other Asian cultures besides Japanese, Chinese and, more recently, Koreans.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I understand the issue about the point of casting actors according to the \textbf{ethnicity} of the characters. And yes, this is something that should be more respected in movies. That being said, there is two big issues here, that Vox didn't point out. First, you can change a fictionnal character \textbf{ethnicity} if you find a great actor who would be great playing the part. As long as it respects the vison of the artist/creator of the character. Hollywood has cast a lot of non caucasian actors to play the part of originaly cancasian characters... but no white people here is complaining. Isn't it what we call hypocrisie? Nick Fury, Domino, Heimdall, all of Peter's friends in Spider-Man: Home-coming, etc. All those characters where originaly "Whites".And secondly, congratulation Vox, you know \textbf{nothing} about Animes. It's important to understand that it is NOT because it is Japanese, that it means that the characters are all Asians or Japaneses. In fact, they rarely are because Japaneses are big fans of caucasian looking people. Whites are exotic for them. When Japaneses want to represent a non asian character, they give them large eyes, pointy chin, pointy nose, \textbf{crazy} eye colors and hair colors. Does it ring any bell? In Ghost In The Shell, the main character is anything but japanese. She is a caucasian looking android who changes appearance in pretty much every sequels. But some things remain: Large eyes, pointy chin and pointy nose. These are not the features of an asian looking \textbf{woman}. Where the point to cast a non asian actress like Scarlett. She really looks the part.Same in Cloud Atlas, those that you called Coreans are in fact kind of an hybride evolution of the futur. A \textbf{race} that doesn't really exist now.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I believe it is the way that the characters are represented that matters though, even though this has gotten much better with time-- there aren't extreme cases like "Breakfast at Tiffany's" anymore thank heavens. And historically, if someone white played a \textbf{black} character by painting their skin \textbf{black}, the backlash would've been severe, as it is seen as exploitation and mockery (also known as "blackface"). I see your point, but the main focus of this conflict isn't the debate whether casting directors need to pinpoint and match each character to a corresponding actor with the exact same \textbf{ethnicity}, it's more like trying to point out and document how yellowface/brownface has historically been a tool to stereotype Asians in films, even though this practice should've been eradicated long ago. You may think, and you are well entitled to think, that this is no big deal since it's just a movie, but for someone people who are living in America, it is quite hurtful to see your own \textbf{race} stereotyped and made invisible by the media. When people grow up watching those stereotyped films, the stereotypes often find their way into real life, affecting how they view other races. Again, this may not happen to everyone, but everyone needs to recognize that this is happening.

We've seen Hollywood elevate indie white actors so why can't the do the same for other ethnicities...especially when the role calls for it. It's not like there are no people of color in the business so they're forced to white wash, there are plenty of people of color that work hard and deserve a chance but instead white people get cast for their roles. Im \textbf{black} btw and I feel there should be more representation of Asian, Latino, \textbf{African} American etc. In mainstream media, realistically whether you like it or not white people aren't the only people on the planet.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Smoove 100 how is it possible to white wash character who aren't even written to be any specific \textbf{race} it's directors preference on who they want to cast based on how they vision the character but that could be based on \textbf{race} but if that's the case then why even bother even auditioning any other races at that point it makes no sense because at that point it isn't white washing it's just hiring an actor based on how they look and act. No \textbf{Indian}  guy is going to even have a chance at an audition if the director specifically wants a \textbf{black} guy for the role and even if it wasn't specifics of color they just have to be good actors, the better you're at acting the higher chance they are going to be hired it's simple. Are you saying minorities aren't as good of actors instead of white people? And if a person fits the role and has been established they would be hired but if you're are talking about a big summer action film with millions of dollars invested in it they aren't going to take a risk if they can't find someone with a big background and fits the character they are going to find someone who can display the character well enough and is popular it's the only logical thing to do, but that can happen with other races instead of white people what if they couldn't find a good actor for a blade remake and instead had a mexican actor perform, why lower the standards just because they couldn't find a good actor whose a specific \textbf{race} and instead keep them high with a good actor who is a different \textbf{race} and can still embody the character it's the safest bet yeah sjws or liberals will probably boycott but honestly what makes people want to consume media more  is a piece of media that can get a offended reaction out of one side while gaining the support of the other for example doom eternal had a joke in it about races and the left got mad you know what happened to the right they got happy and enjoyed seeing a company with the balls to make a joke therefore securing sales thats what drives media it's profit and as long as there is a sure fire way to make profit one side will still buy it and sales will happen\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Indian, Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Ethnicity - Native-American & \cellcolor{green!5}6/406 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.478 \\  \hline

It is not the same because white actors have plenty of roles in hollywood. They make up a large chunk of the industry, where as poc don't have a lot. So when they do finally have a potential role, to have it given to someone who already has so many opportunities to audition for something is a slap in the face. And there is no history of ‘whiteface'. Most times when POC is playing a role that was originally white, the character no longer is white.

Of course, it's not right by any means, since America is multicultural and their movie industry should reflect that, but I'm saying that it's not an easy \textbf{transition}, even for, or maybe especially for the audience.  I tried watching Japanese and Korean movies and it wasn't easy to watch, it always felt to me that the acting was always over dramatic, and somehow I couldn't connect with the characters (is it because I'm not used to the Asian face?) I love some Japanese anime, so the problem shouldn't be the writing. I have to say that watching \textbf{Indian} movies was easier to me from this aspect (meaning I was able to connect with the characters easily) however the problem with \textbf{Indian} movies is the bad writing and directing.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I'm Asian and a big fan of Ghost in the Shell, and I for one think the character of Major Kusanagi Makoto has always uniquely allowed her to be played by a westerner. She is not meant to resemble a Japanese \textbf{woman} physically, she is not physically human. That was a big point of her character, and an important concept in the source material. Her entire body was artificially created to house her "ghost", or human consciousness. I would not be at all surprised if in the world of GitS, her artificial idealised face would bear resemblance to the visage of Scarlet Jo. Just because the source material is Japanese and has a character with a Japanese name, doesn't mean that she has to look like a Japanese. For any adaptation, any consideration of 'faithfulness to the source material' depends on the context of the world within that said material. I would even argue that the casting in fact helps her characterisation further, as having a western face can make her feel even more alienated and feel detached from her own body, a good analogy for her 'unnaturalness', but a shame it wasn't something the film made use of, i think it was a missed opportunity.I find it \textbf{weird} that Americans are getting bent out of shape for this particular casting decision when even the creator have little issue with it. I get that white washing is bad, and representation is important, but in this particular case, it's not a good example of white washing if it is congruent with the source material, and might even help it. If you want to take issue with this film, the biggest target is the plot and the utter failure to bring out the philosophical nature of the source material.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Weird, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}2/298 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.671 \\  \hline

I would understand if they said there were better actors but when they told me I didn't have the eyes of a Asian person, I became very upset. I don't like the idea of the media portraying us Asians as only having 'small' eyes. We come in all shapes, sizes and features and we don't exclusively have small eyes. As others have pointed out, Anime characters don't necessarily look white. They are kinda their own look. People assume blonde hair and big eye anime must be white but a lot of these characters have profiles written about them by the manga artist themselves. And there are a lot of characters who are clearly stated by the artists to be of Asian descent even if they have orange or blonde hair. Think Kurosaki Ichigo from Bleach. And big eyes are actually not uncommon in those of Asian descent. Scientists have measured eye size in Asians and they are no more bigger or smaller than Caucasians. What separates caucasians from Asians anthropologically speaking is that caucasians have protruding brow bones. And even then, some Asians also have those characteristics\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nobody & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!27}1/230 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.435 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The video was good before you mentioned Cloud Atlas. Whoever wrote the script to the video clearly either didn't see Cloud Atlas, or is deliberately misleading. Please, watch the movie before criticizing it. Or don't, I'll tell you what's up with that. In the movie, the same actors were playing different characters from 6 storylines that took place in different time periods, in many cases they wear makeup that would fit the character. In one storyline, everyone looks Asian, so white actors wear yellowface. In another storyline, everyone is white and the Asian actress wears a white face, or whatever you call it, makeup that makes her white. In one case a male actor is playing a female. In another storyline, Halle Berry who is half \textbf{black} is playing Jewish character. THIS MOVIE IS NOT AN EXAMPLE OF \textbf{RACISM}. Yellowface, as other faces, is an artistic choice for the movie and is following the main theme. As for the other examples, clearly Brando or Rooney characters were extremely \textbf{racist}. But Tilda Swinton? She is not playing a Tibetan monk, neither she wears a yellowface. She was chosen as this strange \textbf{alien} character, a cliche dodge even, and she fits the role perfectly. If you complain about this casting choice, you must also complain about Valkyrie, Heimdall, Nick Fury, Roland from Dark Tower and many other non-white actors playing characters that were white in comics or books. But you don't care when it's blackwashing or asianwashing, only when it's whitewashing. You are a hypocrite and virtue signaling at best, and \textbf{racist} at worst. But you know what? Unlike you, I don't care. I think Idris Elba was as good of a choice for Heimdall as Tilda Swinton was for the Ancient One. The only time it matters is when the character's background is important. For example, if someone makes fun of a ginger Irish character, it would be wrong to cast a \textbf{black} or Asian actor, the same way it would be wrong to cast a Native American actor to portray an \textbf{African} leader. As for Aloha movie, it's a bit trickier. Emma Stone didn't portray an Asian character, but a quarter Asian, quarter Hawaiian, and half white. What would be a correct choice for you? An Asian or half-asian may not work. Emma Stone does look the part, and is also a famous actress. But what would work for you? How many quarter-Hawaiian quarter-Chinese actors are there?

But what does Hollywood know about other cultures? Probably not more than a Wikipedia page. I think demanding them to represent a culture and people from it will result in the view of that culture being watered down and lose meaning to people it's meant to connect with.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Ugh white people LOVE to be offended on behalf of other people. As an Asian i can tell you that Asians are SICK of playing stereotypical roles. I applaud Marvel for casting a white women to play the role of the ancient one. I'd be offended if that role was played by an Asian man because it would almost be a caricature. Marvel intentionally chose Tilda to show us how narrow and frankly \textbf{racist} our vision of an ancient sorcerer is. Saying an Asian man should've been cast as the ancient one is like saying "how dare they cast a white man to play a taxi driver? that role should've went to an \textbf{Indian}".All characters in anime are drawn as Asians cuz anime is Asian. That does not mean you have to cast an Asian as every character in any anime adaptation. A lot of anime stories particularly ghost in the shell take place in the future in a global world. I don't think Major was ever even described as Asian. Anime characters have a lot of western features most noticeably big eyes. Scarlett was chosen cause she has a lot of those features.The whole point of acting is playing what you're not. As long as the actor is skilled and he can do justice to the role, it doesn't matter. I mean ffs what's next? You're gonna criticize people who play gangsters but have never been close to a gang? What about rich people playing the role of poor people?I'll agree that sometimes Hollywood does screw up. They should cast actors of the same \textbf{race} when they're portraying a real life person.

About the whitewashing, I don't overly mind or find it too offensive unless it's too overboard like Ashton Kutcher was. It's not the fault of film companies to want to make money from their films and the best way they'll do that is to put a \textbf{common} famous celebrity in their film. They could hire an appropriate cast for each role according to their \textbf{race} in the film, but why does it matter so much?

Sure we aren't a perfect country, but we are all American. So yes, white people established government here, but don't forget the people who helped them. Lewis and Clarke would have been dead without their \textbf{Indian} guides. If they died they never would have been able to explore the other sife of America. The white plantation owners, without the blacks, they wouldn't have made a lot of money to survive with just indentured servants. Sure these things may not seem really huge, but every little thing in history matters. America was built by whites, blacks, Asians, and more.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@IIThunder  LeoII  sorry but no, America had an immigration policy from the 18th century and prior to the 50s or 60s. Of importing white only Europeans, majority of the population in America during it's development. So really most of the people who were actually  building this state were of mostly white origin throughout the years. Most white people did not own slaves, this was something evidently the rich can afford, white people did play a part in the slave trade yet the slaves were sold off to them by POC. And you may have not been taught this in school but Britain was the one who managed to pressure other cultures into stop practicing slavery. Africa, middle east etc.Just an fyi. No offense but if you do research in the cultures that were in this land, you would find that the people who were before the Europeans but not native. Had been killing each other and having rivalries for centuries and it depends on the culture. The French were much more considerate of them than some of the English, they actually learned their language. But yes, there was blood shed but not surprised that there was during that time. But the situation between "natives" and Europeans is not \textbf{black} \& white. You seemed to be taught a one-sided version of history. "Our country isn't just made of white people"Once again, this country for centuries was literally becoming or already majority white. The other side of America, the Navajo state was not as advance as the eurocentric state. Most "natives" did not free their slaves when slavery was federally abolished in the US, they didn't give their slaves citzenship. For example, Don Cheadle. Just another fyi. Most of the traditions and cultures were are most familiar with are from Europe, Halloween is pagan, thanksgiving European concept (of you watch non bias videos about the historical background of thanksgiving you would find both "native Americans" and Europeans at fault) St. Patricks day, valentines day, 4th of the July, Christmas has European origins. The language we speak is of European origin and the history we are aware of is that as well. Most concepts here are of European origin as well. If you are making small exceptions as well then maybe you should take these into considerations.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!5}1/386 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.259 \\  \hline

For example, Brits or Russians (I think Germans escaped this due to there not being much tension after the world wars between the two countries). Both often appear as the bad guys and both are heavily stereotyped. As a Slav, I was very upset at how little I was represented in media when not in a negative light. I never had any of the issues you mentioned but still, it was a letdown. In fact, I think I had a smoother reaction to this due to there being little contrast.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Gabby Wow it's definitely toxic that we continue to mostly exclusively represent one \textbf{race} in our media when we live in a massively diverse country. Something that stuck out was the part about you wishing you had blonde hair. You know that feeling of not being on the in group and not being 'it' was felt by a a lot of white kids too. I remember my childhood friend who had curly brunette hair told told me she really wished she had straight blonde hair —your story reminds me of that. I think aside from just diversifying casts, Hollywood can produce media that better supports society (not like that's Hollywood's goal) by expanding notions of beauty and challenging the existing standards. I myself remember wanting blue eyes so badly as a child because media consistently depicted that as very beautiful—which they are, but so are other colors! Doesn't it say a lot when whitewashed Hollywood makes even white kids feel like they aren't white enough? I can't imagine what it wild be like dealing with that as an actual racial minority, but it's clear dissatisfaction with our identities due to media messages and subtexts has been alarmingly pervasive and seemingly shared across racial boundaries.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Race & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/204 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.49 \\  \hline

Yes they could have given an asian \textbf{woman} the role which would have been cool for her, but the only reason the movie got any attention at all was from having an A-lister like Johansson, and it still was a box office bust.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small My Name I see where you are getting that but what I'm saying is that people are saying too many white people are playing \textbf{black} roles while \textbf{black} and Asian people are also playing white roles. I think diversity in films is fine as long as it isn't just to please people. Diversifying roles shouldn't be about pleasing the public it should be because that would make the film better. The argument or wether or not white people are the majority of films cast isn't really the topic here. Not to mention of course there will be more white people on films this is a majority white country. It isn't a \textbf{racist} thing it is just a fact it isn't bad and we should forced in diversity when it isn't needed or contradicting something.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/134 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.239 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I don't think any modern casting decisions are made with the intent to be \textbf{racist} or to harm others. I do think that there have been modern castings that had poor judgement, but I also think that unless you work in hollywood you shouldn't be outraged about a white person playing an asian character. You should be trying to understanding the casting process, and the idea of having the best actor available portray the character the way it was meant to be portrayed. You should want a good character portrayed well regardless of skin colour. If you have a character that impacts the story because of their \textbf{race}, than yes have the same \textbf{race} play that character, but if there's a character that can be played well by any \textbf{race} then get the best actor for that character. I'm personally not mad about \textbf{race} swaps, so I won't fully understand why people are mad, but I do think people should try and understand both sides of the argument.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Race, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}5/168 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.976 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small LOOK. Regardless of how many ignorant people down vote this video, the fact of the manner is the majority of out-of-touch Mid aged, male, White Hollywood film casters are stuck in the \textbf{racist} 1950's.They are afraid of having their ego's challenged, and are afraid of giving the shine to people they deem as inferior to them.Because in the back of these White Hollywood casters and producers minds, they KNOW they have low self worth about themselves as a people..  So they go out of their way to do and say anything that can make Asian characters in Hollywood films look bad.  They do this by either casting Asians as weak, \textbf{effeminate} characters with horrible accents... or creepy-perv types who can't get the women love interests in the films, and in the end it's always the "good" looking White male character who gets the \textbf{woman}, while the Asian character continues to be portrayed as 2nd class or "creepy"\textbf{Nothing} but White Hollywood propaganda, and the masses eat it up.  \textbf{Black} face on film might be gone for the most part because they have a strong civil rights + advocacy foundation in their history..  People stand up and speak up for the injustices they face in the \textbf{Black} community.  But Asian face on film will ALWAYS be around, because \textbf{racist} White Hollywood casting won't face any backlash from the Asian community, cause the Asian communities focus less so on advocacy and civil rights... and more so on academics and finance related endeavors.  At the end of the day, who needs Hollywood though right?  As visible minorities and POC's, you have the ultimate power by voting with your wallets.  If there is a bs \textbf{racist} movie with superiority undertones in the casting choices or story line.  Don't watch it.   Educate your friends and family about the negative and \textbf{racist} elements of said film(s) and go watch a movie that represents your people in a more positive and honest light.  Let these \textbf{racist} movies be only watched by grumpy \textbf{old} White dudes who miss the "good ol days" of the \textbf{racist} 1950's or whatever.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I agree with the issue of Yellowface and recasting Asian people as white people as being a huge problem in the industry. Asian people need more representation and more lead roles.  What I don't agree with is applying the same thing to anime and manga. Although it is a Japanese cultural art form, its a visual medium with characters who almost always have caucasian looking features. Goku and other characters in anime mostly look like white people and when you cast a white person it looks more similar and more true to the source material. I very in support in more well developed Asian characters and lead roles in films, but I don;t believe in not accurately adapting a manga or anime in visually only because there is stigma and history in \textbf{racism} and stereotyping.

Also, there is a cruel lack of representation  for Asian American and a lack of opportunities for aspiring Asian actors. It would have made perfect sense if they had casted a different actor who's Asian but they didn't. Like I said, he's reincarnated therefore he's supposed to look completely different.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Haby 2611 I agree with you on everything you're saying. The only issue is, in the film, Hugo Weaving - and at least 10 other actors - is reincarnated at least 7 times through the different time periods in a large over-arching, connected story. Hugo goes through several costume and prosthetic changes in the film, he even plays a \textbf{woman} at one point and an evil goblinesque spirit. But most importantly underneath all the different makeups and wigs he's recognizable in all his reincarnations, specifically playing the continues role of an antagonist. So, when the audience sees him on screen they recount him as the villain. Which is why the directors chose to put him in that makeup, specifically because it's during a futuristic time period when 80 of Earth's population has become a mix of asian. If they hadn't and chose to recast someone else it would have been disjointed and confusing for the audience to follow, because at this point they're familiar with already established characters - this movie jumps from time period to time period. Even Halle Barry goes from \textbf{black} to while to asian in her reincarnations during the film. Doona Bae, who plays the protagonist and is South Korean, is reincarnated as a man, a white person, and Filipino. The important aspect of the film is that each character can be spotted in their new reincarnated role. They grow and change, becoming more complex through each life.Tom Hanks is the villain at the start of the story, by the last time-period/reincarnation he developed  into the hero.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/262 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.763 \\  \hline

But look at shows like Kim's Convenience, and Second Jen. I remember seeing Asian characters in Katts and Dog, and  Danger Bay where they didn't play stereotypical characters.... They played marine biologist and a cop. These were \textbf{old} shows decades ago. In film, Double Happiness with Sandra Oh which basically launched her career into a Gray's Anatomy, Arli\$\$, etc. So I think Canada showed more Asian representation earlier than America who weren't portrayed as waiters, restaurant and laundromat owners, gang members or martial artists. The only American show that had a positive Asian actor was George Takei's character in Star Trek. Huge Chinese and Asian in news ie. Andrew Chang (CBC), Mutsumi Takehashi (CTV Montréal - she's been there for decades!), and I'm sure there's more whether it be on national or regional newscasts. Personally, I think Canada is more progressive than the US in many respects. Remember, we pride ourselves on multiculturalism. Even South Asians like Ian Hanomansing, Camille Ross, etc are main anchors and hosts.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}1/194 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.515 \\  \hline

I agree wholly for their reasoning back then being totally \textbf{racist} and to definitely not do it when it's based on a real life character, but changing up the races in fictional characters to an extent can be qualified as ok. Ofc don't whitewash or blackwash of purplewash everything and if it's a certain culture being portrayed yah  let the cultural person do it but if it's really not a cultural character then do whoever is the best actor or actress for the job. Don't be \textbf{racist} on either spectrum but excluding a \textbf{race} or forcing diversity is basically my message is. Choose the cast based on what's NEEDED to portray the character correctly (this going to, biographies, cultural characters, most fit actors; etc)Ex: if I remember correctly in Cloud Atlas they often played different races, genders etc in each time period. The story is meant for that to happen.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I believe it's wrong to do most things like this but some can be excused like with Ghost in the Shell.

So if Japan wants to cast a Japanese Superman to get Japan into the character so be it. If something is in the realm which it was based off of then I could see a problem with that like an \textbf{old} American movie getting a remake where the original had someone Asian and the remake had someone who wasn't, for example more recently how they switched Mary Jane to \textbf{black} is just as bad if not worse because they also changed the character entirely.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!5}2/128 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.562 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Hollywood wants to pretend they are a champion for diversity, but any time someone points out how many \textbf{black} actors there are, I always just point out how Asian and Hispanic actors don't get near as much recognition.  One of my favorite movies of all time is Seven Years in Tibet.  But if you notice, the movie has pretty much every well known Asian actor Hollywood could find at the time minus Jackie Chan.  Which is not that many.  Less than a dozen.  They're all amazing actors, but constantly got type casted as Karate instructors, restaurant owners or shady villains from the "far east".And while I'd like to blame Hollywood for it all, I really can't.  They are actually casting these people based on the trends of their audience.  The real issue is that despite America being a melting pot, many people in America are still closed off to the outside world.  They are uncomfortable watching a subtitled movie or learning about a culture beyond what they grew up with.  They need a movie to be 'Americanized' before they will commit to trying it.  Which is why you have stuff like Avatar or Dragon Ball completely ignoring its roots and just defaulting to a bunch of white actors.  It isn't \textbf{racism}, it's a moderate form of \textbf{xenophobia}.  But a \textbf{xenophobia} people don't actually recognize.  They don't hate other cultures, they're just ignorant of them.  Which Hollywood sure doesn't do much to fix.  You can even make the case that Hollywood encourages it, so they won't have foreign competition in their domestic market.  Imagine if anime had taken off in America and was overtaking Pixar films.  Yeah, that's a future Disney sure doesn't want to think about.I theorize this is why British cinema has been such a hit in America for the last few decades.  It's "foreign" in the sense that it has different cultural nuances, but the people still speak English.  This simple lack of a language barrier allows most people in America to open themselves up to watching a Harry Potter film or an episode of Dr Who.  But then it's like pulling teeth to get those same people to watch a subtitled version of a Bruce Lee film or some anime, despite them absolutely loving those things in dubbed form.  I'm not trying to chastise the American public.  But hopefully someone reading this might try watching Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon subtitled next time.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Peter Sellers is somewhat of an exception to this.  Sure, he played an Asian character while not being Asian himself, but the choice of him in that movie role was based on his radio work.  As the most vocally versatile of the Goon Show radio cast in the 50s, he was called upon to produce a wide variety of voices throughout the run of the show.  This included an homage to the \textbf{Indian} people he met while working in India during the second world war (a character written by \textbf{Spike} Milligan who not only did wartime service in India but was actually born there).  In some ways, Sellers was cast purely for the voice work and the visuals were made to serve that.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Ehhh, there's more to the 'Ghost in the Shell' casting than "white washing."  It's an easy target, but you have to consider that the Major could've been white in the original - she want anything.  Plus, who would've worked in that role with that amount of star power.  Avatar was garbage period and their races aren't really established in the series.  I guess what I'm saying is claiming what's happening now with white people in "Asian" roles shows how much people don't understand show business.  If there was an Asian Scarlett Johansson, she MAY have been considered for that role, even if Major was a cyborg that didn't belong to any \textbf{race}.  That's not being \textbf{racist}.

White-washing worked back in the day when people were not exposed to the various, beautiful diversity in the world. It brought them comfort to think of Jesus Christ and everyone else in the Bible (except that one Magi) as White. People don't need that kind of pseudo comfort anymore. I understand that White people feel threatened in the United States because they see more diversity in their neighborhoods but what they don't understand is how long people of color have waited to see ANY representation in anything. There is a long-standing "joke" about any time you see a \textbf{Black} person in a horror movie; they're usually one of the first to die off. Or, they're simply the "token \textbf{Black} person" added for cultural "flavor." Same with Latinos. This is why I hardly watch American films. Oh. And don't even let me start on Americans redoing foreign films, like there was something wrong with the first presentation or that we need a more American-friendly presentation. American remakes are almost-always trash. (I leave that .0001 chance for margin of error) Long story short, why don't we lead with our wallets and stop buying into the "well maybe it's not going to be THAT bad" when we see this type of misrepresentation and exclusion?

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small "When someone like Scarlet Johansson is cast as the lead in an adaptation of a Japanese series it's important to understand that" in the original Ghost in The Shell \textbf{nobody} was strictly Asian. Yes, they were Japanese in the story, but physically speaking most of them were drawn with varied racial features. This is true for most manga and anime. Everyone knows about the prevalence of absurd hair colours, for example.Take Batou for example; big, burly, square jaw, pale hair. Doesn't sound very Japanese, eh? Or let's consider Togusa; pointed jaw, angular nose, light brown hair. Sound Asian to you?And it's even more ridiculous when you consider that in every Ghost in The Shell canon Matoko Kusanagi is completely cybernetic aside from the brain. She could be literally any \textbf{race} and her face wouldn't show it. Her body is fake, her hair is purple, her eyes are \textbf{r\textbf{ed}}. Hell, in the new OVA series her backstory is that she didn't even make it out of the womb, so she's been a full cyborg her entire life. \textbf{Nobody} in the world would have any idea what her real face might have looked like. She could have been \textbf{black}, or she could have been a really, really smart cat that people mistook for a human.So whining when a white \textbf{woman} is cast to play a raceless cyborg in a sci-fi movie is absurd and makes you look uneducated about the subject matter.Also, I'd like to quickly bring up the question of why it's OK to recast a white character as \textbf{black}, but it's abominable to cast an Asian character as white. Could someone answer this? Why the blatant double standard? Either both are fine to do or neither are.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I have to disagree on this one. The surplus and availability of white actors in Hollywood means that they are more likely to fill roles in movies, regardless of the \textbf{ethnicity} of their portrayed role. Blaming "white actors" is incorrect. Would you rather these movies not be made? Even if you say yes, you have to acknowledge that you're in the minority of the movie-going public.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I agree with most of these but I don't think live action Ghost in The Shell was \textbf{y\textbf{e\textbf{llow}}} face or \textbf{racist}. Japan loves Steven Spielberg's Ghost In The Shell and Motoko Kusanagi is a purple haired \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} eyed cyborg who is a fullbodied cyborg where her whole body is mechanical including her brain. So any \textbf{woman} of any \textbf{race} can play her since she is a machine. I love Ghost In The Shell the manga, anime, even the video game for Playstation 2. But I don't think Scarlett Johanson was being \textbf{racist} since she was playing a cyborg character with very anime looking features that aren't primarily Japanese features since in the films Motoko Kusanagi had blue eyes and dark ink \textbf{colored} blue hair or jet \textbf{black} hair with blue highlights and in Stand Alone Complex Ghost In The Shell she has purple hair and \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} eyes and looks more like a doll than a human. Most cyborgs in GITS are racially ambiguous since they are full bodied cyborgs and do not look Japanese. Like Batou from GITS is Caucasian looking with pale features and very light almost white blonde hair in the anime. And Nishkawa also doesn't look very Japanese either only the chief and Togusa look Japanese and they aren't fully cyborg or full bodied cyborgs only parts of them are. I mean live action Ghost In The Shell while a bit difderent from the anime films like the originals and Arise I thought it was respectfully done and I can't call it \textbf{y\textbf{e\textbf{llow}}} face or \textbf{racist}. Ironically live action GITS was an even bigger hit In Japanese theaters than it was in the USA. And they showed Scarlett Johanson playing Motoko Kusanagi and showed posters and trailers to people in Tokyo and they all said she fit the role well and thought that the live action Ghost in The Shell was cool and looked good. \textbf{Nobody} in Japan had a problem with it at all. They thought Scarlett looked very close to Original Motoko. I can understand the grievances with DBZ live action and the Last Airbender films since those people are all biologically Japanese and are not made of robot parts. But for GITS I have to give it a pass its not \textbf{racist} at all and even people in Japan agree that it isn't. Motoko isn't human so she doesn't need a perfect \textbf{race} case since her body is purely a mechanical shell for her human soul or "ghost". It's an artificial mechanical body not a real Japanese girl with a human body and since Motoko isn't really human anymore it doesn't apply.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Colored, Nobody, Race, Racist, Red, Woman, Yellow & \cellcolor{green!27} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Asian (East- China, Japan, Korea, Philippines, Vietnam), Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Ethnicity - Native-American, Gender - General, Nationality - Chinese, Nationality - Japanese & \cellcolor{green!27}20/438 & \cellcolor{green!27}4.566 \\  \hline

Let's think again, what about \textbf{indian} and asian movies that use american and european stories and fill all the roles with asian actors. Maybe cos they don't have enough european and american actors wanting to act with an asian language film. Instead they choose highly recognized asian actors to portray foreigners characters.Of course there's discrimination on film and entertaiment industry, but not beacuse they choose white people to play asian roles, but cos they never cast asian people in roles where the \textbf{race} is not important like romantic comedies or drama. Usually this big franchaise films like dragon ball and the last airbender don't risk on casting asian actors cos there are not enough asian movie stars with big fan bases that ensure the ticket sales that such a expensive production expects. hollywood rarely gives chance to asians to make a big carrer that's why theres not many asian movie stars, but asian actors shouldnt be limited to play asian intended roles only.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Indian, Race, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General, Ethnicity - Native-American & \cellcolor{green!5}3/172 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.744 \\  \hline

As a result, Japanese pop culture idolizes blonde people, so it's not surprising that if a future Japanese \textbf{woman} could pick any body to hold her consciousness she would pick Scarlett's body.  I'm not even close to white and look \textbf{nothing} like Scarlett, but if I could look like her I would and my life would be better.

Maybe I'm nitpicking, but really that movie was about reincarnation and souls reocurring in the human timeline and the filmmakers decided to represent that by keeping the actors/actresses as the souls of the people rather than the individual characters. Like the white man on a ship a few centuries ago has the same soul as some future Korean in Neo-Seoul so they're played with the same actor.

Just take Donnie Yen and Tony Jaa as an example, they are seeing increasing exposure in Hollywood, I don't think there is a need to be so sensitive about it.White washed films in the modern era are more likely to fail than to succeed, just take a look at DragonBall, Last Airbender, and so on.

China makes up a gigantic portion of ticket sales and with the on-going problems with Tibet and China they A: couldn't cast a Tibetan person or they would loose that market, B: couldn't cast a Chinese person or they would loose that market, and C: couldn't just cast a random "Asian Person" or they would come off as \textbf{racist} and insensitive. so they got a good actress to fill the role and went on the moral high ground of feminism.Although then there's Gods of Egypt..... so yeeeeeaaaahh, white wash is still a thing.... just wanted to explain those two movies. lol\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/144 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.694 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Including Cloud Atlas is an unfair inclusion, due to it being intrinsic to the stories. They are all being told by the \textbf{old} man and major roles cast in each story he tells are cast by people he has met on his life. (At least that's as close as I've come to figuring that movie out) So all cast members play out the story in the \textbf{old} mans head and that is what we are watching. As well as an Asian role, Xun Zhou also played a blonde caucasian lady in the storytellers main plot line. Doona Bae played an English aristocrats daughter in one plot line and a Mexican lady in another as well as the heroine in a pivotal plot point. Hugo Weaver not only played an Asian but also played nurse Ratchet or something close to that. This movie doesn't fit an  otherwise justified disgust and it detracts from your point. In the case of most modern cinema, the choice is incomprehensible. Casting Directors in charge, should get another job, this one obviously isn't working out. They robs the story of depth and structure. With potential multi million dollar franchises like the last Airbender devoid and dried up of any hope of them wringing money from fans,  because of stupid decisions starting, but not limited to, casting, may be the only way change will happen.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Where did I say I was offended on Scarlett being cast? I simply think it's disappointing that Hollywood didn't take this as an opportunity to cast an Asian-American, same with the Netflix adaptation of Death Note (especially Death Note because Light is 100 \textbf{ethnic} Japanese). Also, you can't take the opinions of Japanese people in Japan the same as those of Asian americans, because while Japan is a homogenous country where Asian faces are almost always represented in popular media, Asian-Americans rarely see people who look like themselves in the position of protagonists or heroes in American films and TV. This was another situation where Asian-americans felt slighted from the opportunity to see themselves on screen (This has happened again and again ex. Dragon Ball movie, Avatar: The Last Airbender, etc.) However I am not naive, I understand why they cast Scarlett and technically Makoto in the manga and anime is a cyborg with ambiguous racial background.

Now, it's a different scenario when the characters are outright stated to be European, as in the case of Attack on Titan. If Hollywood ever did a live action adaptation I would honestly be offended if many of the characters WERE Asian, considering the fact that Mikasa's rarity as the only Japanese person (half-Japanese) is a plot point.Now, if Hollywood used Mikasa's half-Japanese \textbf{ethnic} background to justify casting a completely NON-Asian person, I would have a problem with that.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnic & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/133 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.752 \\  \hline

Either way they were screwed, so they tried to dodge a bigger bullet, and they made a wise choice. Here's the thing: A.) I already said that the other option would not work B.)

Bollywood casting is different in that when they remake the movie, they don't have \textbf{Indian} actors pretending that they are white; the script is essentially changed so that the characters are now \textbf{Indian}, and fit the story to match their culture, not imitate American/White culture.

You know, where women and people who aren't white can be \textbf{doctors}? I think the point of casting an Asian \textbf{woman} as Watson was to emphasise this contrast. Again, it's an adaptation of the story, one in which Lucy Liu (who plays Watson) does not pretend to be white, or a man. Also, she's an American, so she fits in with this context perfectly. Most white people cast as Asian characters have no connection to the culture that they are portraying. They are cast because of the perception of "normality", aka the idea that white people are the norm and everyone else must accept it. It's called "whitewashing" because we see a pattern forming where other cultures and ethnicities are either erased or altered in film to fit into this perceived norm.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Woman, doctors & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/153 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.307 \\  \hline

We treat one \textbf{race} differently than another.The Oscars had huge issues due to no people of color being nominated for some of the more prestigious awards. I think that's a reasonable objection. But then we have awards shows like the BET awards that do exactly the same thing but instead of not nomination \textbf{black} people, they tend not to nominate white people.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small You're seeing everything as \textbf{black} \& white and that's not the world we live in. I entirely understand why you're comparing Elementary and Dr Strange but what we're critiquing, and what this video is about, is the systemised removal of \textbf{ethnic} characters within film. Do you really think there's systemised removal of white characters? Think about every hollywood movie that's come out this year. Think about Elementary for a second. It's a TV show set within modern American, it might be an adaptation of Sherlock, but it set in an entirely different context. America is a melting pot of multiculturalism. And this is reflected in the series. Only 63.7 of the population is white and yet 73.1 of speaking roles in films goes to white people. If you narrow that to lead roles, it's far more than 73.1. The thing about Doctor Strange is, unlike Elementary, they're keeping it as close to the comics as possible. They even brought Stan Lee in to help them keep it the same. Yet the one thing that changes is that the Ancient One, a symbol of wisdom and knowledge, gets turned from Asian to white. My question is, why change it? I understand how you're seeing all character changes as the same, but I explained the change in Elementary in my other comment. What purpose does the Ancient One being white instead of Asian have? This is just one example, this video provides others and these are only the tip of the iceberg.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@superherowho All right, I'll bite. Point by point.1.) But please don't try and pretend like \textbf{racism} within the film industry is fake.The onus is on you to prove that it exists. Simply switching one actor for another doesn't prove \textbf{racism}.The only way this possibly makes sense in context is if you think that Asians are being passed on roles simply because they are Asian.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small You don't seem to understand the point everyone is making. If \textbf{racism} was dead, we could replace any actor with any other actor and it would be fine, who cares about their \textbf{ethnicity}. But \textbf{racism} isn't dead and neither is inequality. The casting of white people in asian characters roles isn't bad cos they're changing the character, it's because they're taking away roles from asian actors, who already rarely get cast because they're asian. White people pervade cinema, like I said, majority of big films that come out have white people as leads. You're misinterpreting the problem. The problem is not casting someone of another \textbf{ethnicity}. It's creating a discourse where white people are at the forefront of every film despite, like I said before, only making up 63.7 of the population. It's creating the idea in the minds of the population that only white people can fill these roles. This is starting to change, we're seeing asian people in more and more roles and that's good but we still haven't come near equality. In reference to Star Trek, hollywood has always cast people of similar ethnicities in a certain role. That's never been a huge problem. Even within Star Trek you have American and English actors portraying roles of European heritage and that's never a problem cos it's close enough. The problem is about the inequality, not about changing roles.

"The casting of white people in Asian characters roles isn't bad cos they're changing the character, it's because they're taking away roles from Asian actors, who already rarely get cast because they're Asian."You need some evidence backing that up. I see absolutely no evidence that they're not being cast simply because they're Asian.If you have evidence supporting that hypothesis, PLEASE present it. Show me that actors are being passed on roles simply due to them being Asian.2.) " White people pervade cinema, like I said, majority of big films that come out have white people as leads."Probably because the majority of people in the US are white. When 74.2 of the population is white and only 4.8 is Asian, you would expect to see about 15 times as many leading roles going to white actors as Asian actors. This isn't \textbf{racism}, its simply math. Source:  [LINK] So the whole idea of Asian actors getting less leads than white actors actually makes a lot of sense. Guess who gets the leads in Asian movies? Asians. Same math at work. They are way more populus than Whites ergo, they get way more of the parts.3.)  It's creating a discourse where white people are at the forefront of every film despite, like I said before, only making up 63.7 of the population.Every film? Now you're just being plain dishonest. Go look at the list of films that came out this year and tell me that every lead went to a white actor. You won't be able to.4.)  "This is starting to change, we're seeing asian people in more and more roles and that's good but we still haven't come near equality."You want Asians, who make up 1/15 of the population, to get an equal amount of roles that Whites get?

Look, I gave you stats that prove that asian people, or pretty much anyone who's not white, get cast in roles far less than white people.

I really do.You're an idiot.I have explained over and over and over that I don't have a claim here. I'm not saying \textbf{racism} is leading to Asians not getting parts. I'm not saying it doesn't either. I'm simply asking for some reasonable (non-fallacious, non-fictional) evidence. The only possible reason someone could be this closed-minded is because they can't think.Every time you say that I'm saying "\textbf{racism} doesn't exist" is completely misrepresenting my position. Its untrue, its inflammatory and quite frankly, its offensive.So yes, I agree that you should absolutely stop posting here. I think your time would be much better spend by working on your reading comprehension skills and your reasoning skills. You don't seem to have much of either. And that's going to be a big big problem from you eventually.You could be 100 right that actors are being denied parts due to their \textbf{race}. But your absolute refusal to cite evidence, your inane and completely fictional ideas, and your constant need to resort to fallacious arguments is never going to convince anyone of anything.You won't even address you making wildly absurd claims. You just ignore any point contrary to your own and make more in hopes that brute force is somehow going to be seen as "truth".Take a philosophy class. Learn to debate.

Like the Rob Schneider and Ashton Kutcher ones, to me, are obviously supposed to be a joke. Look at Robert Downey Jr in Tropic Thunder. Maybe sometimes it's in poor taste, though.Also, I think representing a real person with an actor of a different \textbf{race} can be okay as long as their \textbf{race} or appearance have \textbf{nothing} to do with the story, and they don't try to say that the character is Asian even though the actor obviously isn't. But if the characters \textbf{race} never comes up and doesn't make a difference, it's fine.... Usually.Also, I never understood the hate for white actors playing anime characters because most anime characters don't look Asian.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I totally agree about Cloud Atlas.  Each time period in the film has a main character, and those characters are all played by an actor who is of the same \textbf{gender} and \textbf{nationality} in real life.  Meanwhile, the other incarnations of those characters sometime require the actor to change their \textbf{gender} and/or \textbf{nationality} using make-up.The reason Jim Sturgess plays Hae-Joo Chang is because he's a reincarnation of Adam Ewing, the main character in the Pacific Islands segment.  Likewise, Sonmi 451 is the main character in the Neo Seoul segment, so she is played by Doona Bae, a Korean actor.  Cloud Atlas gets criticized for not casting an Asian actor in a lead role, but Doona Bae is the lead actor in the Neo Seoul segment, not Jim Sturgess, and to assume otherwise is \textbf{sexism} if anything.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender, Nationality, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}5/137 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.65 \\  \hline

It's pretty much done not really as a localization (because the original source is Japanese) but pretty much as an adaptation, because most Japanese readers see and view these characters as themselves, Japanese. It's an interesting example, but the thing is, it's not really the same, as Japanese readers envision themselves as Erin or other main characters (even though they are Japanese), so this adaptation, to an American point of view seems like a localization (changing white characters to Asian) but honestly, its not really the same case. It's like white American people in the U.S. imagining themselves as Superman, who, although is \textbf{Alien}, can technically be any \textbf{race} or \textbf{ethnicity} imaginable and we wouldn't imagine him in any other way.

The fact that every industry in the world is not exactly representative of the racial and \textbf{sex} makeup of their respective countries is not, in itself \textbf{racist}.

The reportedly named "sorafanchick" had to say "For some reason, people think it is a coincidence that all the actors and actresses cast in the whole world for Hollywood movies are white". Hey, moron, ever heard of will smith, one of hollywoods biggest stars, and has been for years. \textbf{Black} people are everywhere in Hollywood. Hollywood is filled with people who are irritatingly left wing, and who would love to have racial diversity, and asians are the highest paid demographic in the country (they make more than white people, on average). Maybe this undermines your victim hood narrative a bit, and maybe asians are where they are, socially and economically, because of cultures that value education in worthwhile fields, and not going off to be an aspiring actor in Hollywood.Now, If they want to cast a white \textbf{woman} in an american version of an anime, I'm not going to get outraged by the "Injustice".\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Nobody, Race, Racist, Sex, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}9/369 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.439 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Jumping Spider This is not about victimhood...this is reality.  You're ignoring the fact that white people do in fact make up the majority of film characters, even for characters that are not typically white.  And even on television white people have taken roles that were supposed to belong to \textbf{black} people.  You ever heard of the show Awkward?  Well, this show was actually made by a \textbf{black} \textbf{woman} right here on Youtube with a \textbf{black} person as the lead role on her youtube channel.  Tina Fey found the videos and agreed to air it...but do you know what Tina Fey told her?  She told her it would be better to make her white.  She replaced the \textbf{black} girl with the white girl.  Watch the video here on youtube.  The youtube is called Awkward \textbf{black} girl (her video has Tina Fey in the title).  She describes how her show was literally whitewashed in front of her face.  That is just one example.  After seeing this video of her explanation behind Tina Fey's decision, I wonder if you would believe it?  It is very true that some Hollywood castors (not all but some) prefer to cast white over other races in some cases.  Have you actually ever looked at a statistic of Hollywood's casted actors and actresses?  \textbf{Black} people are a minority on that list, and hardly any of them are \textbf{black} women.  And have you looked at a statistic of how many minorities are considered top Hollywood actors?  If Will Smith is the only one you can mention, that is not many.  The statistic of other minorities are not nearly as high as white actors and actresses.  This is not a myth.  This is a fact.Hardly any Asians have been lead roles in American film, despite that fact the largest Asian communities exit in California (right around Hollywood).  And yet when it comes to Asian characters, they still cast white people in those roles. Do you not see that? To add, there are millions of Asians who want to be actors.  Why do you think there are so many major Youtubers that are Asian right now?  They are all looking to get their feet in the door of Hollywood, but Hollywood is not biting.  Why do you think this is so? Do you honestly believe that Scarlett was the best person for the job out of all the Asians in the world that could've been in that role? I'm curious to your answer on this.  You keep saying that people are just being victims, but do you honestly have any explanation as to why they chose a white person to play the role of a Japanese character? Look, I understand that Scarlett was chosen because she is a well known actor.  I just feel  that by choosing "well-known" actors, it will always limit minorities because unfortunately the only ones that have been able to become well known have always been white people.  The only movies that have come out in recent years before this decade have been movies with white people.  As a result, no minority has been given a chance to become big time Hollywood stars.  Becoming a Hollywood star is a big deal for any person who wants to be an actor because Hollywood has the most influence entertainment wise. If you or your children wanted to be actors or actresses, but hardly had any opportunities to get a role in Hollywood, how would you respond?  Do you really think Asians have the same opportunity to be in the same roles as white people?\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}8/596 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.342 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small isn't the fact [<---------------notice the use of the word fact] that all these Asian roles of Asian characters with the original scripts featuring an Asian lead being replaced by a different \textbf{race} the definition of systemic discrimination against Asians during casting? Your argument seems to be inherently lazy, and misguided as well. What does the average income of Asians have to do with your argument or this subject on Hollywood for that matter - no one ever said Asians feel victimized about income, this was always a subject of misrepresentation.The sad part is, the masses, like yourself, are easily influenced by media - which means whatever stereotype exists, film is the best way to promote and spread those ideas. And when you have areas where Asians don't reside, and its citizens watching those movies, a film's portrayal is the idea of an entire culture that's left in their head.I've seen the other side too - white people as being portrayed as big \textbf{dumb} and trigger happy in Asian media. You're probably gonna say that it doesn't affect you or your feelings - mostly because you don't seem like the type to see the bigger picture. So let me spell it out for you:  it's the fact that Westerners are misrepresented in this manner. And indirectly it does affect you if you ever want to travel to these parts. I had a friend that came back from Korea, someone had told him that "He's not as \textbf{dumb} as he looks." That makes me sad because it reminds me of when people would say "Your dicks not small like I thought." Funny, but also a sad, example.If they want to cast Johansen, I won't get mad either, they wanted star power - but.. let's not forget that there's another reason (maybe not as major). They don't think you're ready for an Asian outside of the typecast roles of Kung Fu masters on the big screen. Aren't you offended that they think you're \textbf{racist}, or at least slightly biased?Personally, I think it's getting a lot better.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small +Jumping Spider I don't know. Even if it's a bit exaggerated sometimes, I do think there's quite a large degree of discrimination against Asians Americans when it comes to casting them for lead film roles.I admit, I used to buy into the stereotypes that Asians were less good than other races at doing "creative" things like film, comedy, and music, mostly because I didn't really think Asian Americans were familiar enough with American culture to really participate in it in a big way. I'd always thought that Hollywood rejected aspiring Asian actors because those actors simply didn't have the talent they were looking for. I also thought that Asians failed to land lead roles because there were simply less Asians in the US to begin with, so statistically speaking, there wouldn't be many Asian lead actors in the first place. Plus, I thought Asians would rather pursue more stable career paths, not something as risky and unpredictable as entertainment. These were all factors which I thought explained why we never really had any Asian American movie stars, singers, dancers, or other entertainment talents.Sounds pretty reasonable, right?But after the advent of Youtube, my view of Asians changed COMPLETELY. I saw all these talented Asian Youtube stars that quite literally came out of nowhere, all these Asian Americans who could actually sing, rap, dance, act, write skits, be creative, be hilarious, and give superb performances in theatre and independent film (which they promoted through Youtube). In fact, to this day, a good proportion of the biggest and most successful Youtube stars are -- you guessed it -- Asian American.This took me completely by surprise because:1) It happened so fast, and2) It happened among the LAST racial group I would expect it to happen to.Before Youtube, I never imagined that Asians would be doing any of those "artsy" activities, because they were the opposite of the Asian stereotypes I bought into (and I KNOW I'm not the only one who bought into them). So upon seeing these things, I naturally thought to myself, "since when were Asians so... outgoing? Since when did they become so good at doing "creative" stuff? And why did they pop out of nowhere all of a sudden? One after another, just like that?"And then it hit me -- these kinds of Asians have probably ALWAYS existed in America. We just never got to see them because major entertainment companies didn't want to hire Asians on the belief that an Asian face wouldn't sell as well to the broader American audience (most of which is non-Asian). All that talent means \textbf{nothing} if the music and film industries don't think that an Asian face could appeal to the broader American audience.Therefore, talented Asians simply get passed over during the selection process in favor of a non-Asian face that could generate more money, particularly a white one. That's precisely why Youtube is dominated by Asian American stars -- it's because of the massive buildup of Asian Americans who have been longing to enter the entertainment business and express their creative talents. Asian Americans took to Youtube because no other place would give them the opportunity to express their talents. Youtube doesn't have a middle man stopping you from doing your thing, no big name producers to tell you, "You're good, but you're just not the kind of voice we're looking for" or "you don't quite fit the mold we had in mind."I can literally name more successful Asian American Youtube stars than all Asian American actors and artists in the film and music industries combined.

So so sorry."Cloud Atlas" is a special case because of the concept and the spiritual aspect of Buddhism behind it. The actor does not only play multiple "person", they played "soul" - a soul that will be reborn again and again to live in a similar/different destiny every time: a white man's soul could be reborn as a \textbf{black} \textbf{woman},  then as an asian man, on and on.And every soul is connected with each other by fate. For example, if you do something meaningful to another person (ex. find your true love, or murder someone) in your previous/current life, you two will have a chance of meeting each other in similar manner next life. And when a million people are connected to each other, their destiny is intertwined and keeps shifting, hence the word "cloud" in "Cloud Atlas".The creators truly understand this native Asian spiritual concept, which is really, really hard for people who are not born around a native Buddhism culture to get it. That's why it did quite well in Asian countries like China.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Burning They are wanted, if a movie can achieve a POC seal of approval then it gets extra praise from the left, most Asians in the West don't want to go into careers like acting and music as they are successful to the biggest actors. Look at all the \textbf{old} Kung Fu masters in films or the street vendors that are typically played by Asians. As in Asian culture you are pressed to be in a high paying job (especially the men) and discouraged to go into jobs that are as risky as acting and music. If they have that much of a problem then they will need to take it upon themselves to go into these industries, it is largely a case of actors and actresses being a strong enough actor to present the characters. Mostly it is the white kids on Tumblr who will scream that white people can't experience \textbf{racism} and how being white means you are more privileged if you live on the street then a millionaire \textbf{black} person. It is largely proportional as well with Asians and Pacific Islanders making up just 2 of America's population, with most Asians not going into acting because they were discouraged too. It gets to a point where they will need to either bring in actors from Asian countries (which would be hugely expensive and there would be no guarantee on the actor's English knowledge, also they would have to have a video interview before flying then over and they risk missing the delivery of a line that could make or break the actor's chance at playing the character) or employ white actors for the roles as you wouldn't want to use an actor who only does Rom-Coms in an action film rated 18, it would be disastrous as people will expect a Rom-Com look at Se7ev and its test screen. Also the ones they have a problem with now Ghost in the Shell and Doctor Strange are easily explainable; Ghost in the Shell - She can be any \textbf{race}, and she has been praised for looking like the character by Japanese people in Japan. Doctor Strange - There is currently heat between the relationship of Tibet and China meaning that bringing in a Tibetan actor would lose the Chinese market and bringing in a Chinese actor would lose the Tibetan market, however, replacing the character with a white person ensures that there is little chance of a cultural outrage occurring because of the film.

The issue isn't down to \textbf{race}, it is down to the actors ability and how big their name is. No name actors aren't likely to be hired by Hollywood because they won't perform as well as an experienced actor. Hollywood doesn't stop people from achieving anything unless an actor gave a subpar performance which lead to an unsuccessful film. There is an issue of reusing actors I'm Hollywood who are already big stopping no name actors from getting a shot at the film. Hollywood prefers actors who have already made their name in film. Actors who's name will bring in fans. Actors who's most known genre align with their film. Anyone can make it in Hollywood, however to consolidate your ability in Hollywood you must first build a name through TV or other forms of medium. The more popular the actor the likelier they are to be cast in a film. Some aspiring actors go broke or even homeless so they give up and return back to normality from their dream. The issue is Hollywood constantly reusing tested actors in order to garner a larger audience, there is no wide spread \textbf{racism} of Hollywood.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Nadiya Nanoha) Well the major thing is the population make up. In Korea and Japan it is very homogenous. Almost entirely Korean people or Japanese people living in a country run by Korean or Japanese people in a culture dominated by Korean or Japanese people. China is largely the same deal but a little less so due to the amount of foreigners living in big cities for business and such, but for the most part it fits in with Korea and Japan. The US on the other hand is a melting pot of most every \textbf{race} and \textbf{ethnicity} you could pull out of a hat. Name it and there is a 75 chance there will be at least one person of   decent in the country. So asking for, Japan for example, to have more white actors is seen as stupid because there isn't a sizable enough white population that ache to see themselves represented on screen in their home country. Same as China and Korea. The US on the other hand has a very, very sizable Asian American population, and they are not the majority, but they also can not be ignored. While in Japan foreign residences of non East Asian origin may be around 1 of the population (and even that number includes some East Asians so it could be much lower), America's Asian American population is about 5. That is about 19.4 million people. Compared to Japan's around 1 million and counting. So it's a bit more of an issue for there to be Asian actors in American movies than white actors in East Asian movies. Plus, who wants to be told that the movie industry and culture of their \textbf{nation} doesn't give enough shits about them to include people that make up a sizable amount of the population and that they should just watch K-dramas or other Asian media for Asian actors.

Of course I would. I don't usually care about the \textbf{ethnicity} of the actor/actress as long as they're good in the role.

The fact is that a white \textbf{woman} is playing a Japanese character, so many ppl are in rage. And on a small note, Asian actors have been turned down for Asian roles because they are Asian.

I don't know much about the Death Note adaptation- Is it still set in Japan? If so, not looking for Asian actors is \textbf{dumb}.Whitewashing is not a good thing, and if this were virtually any other adaptation I would cry foul. But the Major is a cyborg, in a story where the Humanity of the main character, even when they are in an entirely artificial body, is a key focus. The Hermione comparison is flawed because she has been portrayed as White in illustrations and in the movies. She is, in the source material, Caucasian and this is not up for debate, yet people are completely okay with that change but not this one? I disagree.Would I have preferred an Asian actress? Yeah, I would've. Not casting Asian actors because they are Asian actors is wrong, but I don't know if that's what actually happened behind the scenes here. I can live with a White actress here because the source material allows for the change with few differences and because Scarlet Johannsson is a good actress.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Dumb & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}2/259 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.772 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Absolute Configuration So in the world of fiction books, illustrations define a character's \textbf{ethnicity}? Okay, then let's look at it this way.First of all, I would like to point out that Attack on Titan movie was made by Japan and produced by Japan in where the society isn't as diverse as America and their movie industry isn't as big as ours so I doubt they can make deals with foreign actors. Death Note is being made in America, Hollywood.Secondly in Ghost Shell, whether the characters are human or not, they are supposedly Japanese. If you look at all humanoid androids being developed in Japan, they all look like Asian or manga characters, while the ones being made in America look like Caucasians or cartoon characters. The cyborgs are usually and naturally influenced by the culture and tradition originated from the respective location.Lastly, I think that Hermione example isn't adequately justify whitewashing in Ghost Shell. I understand what you were trying to say, but how many non-white characters are in the universe of Harry Porter? If I remember correctly 99 of the actors were white, so what if one of 100 white characters was portraited by a \textbf{black} actor? Is this such a big deal? I don't think so. Even the creator didn't care and pointed out she didn't have a \textbf{ethnicity} preference for Hermione. Then, I guess a white illustrator pained Hermione as white and \textbf{nobody} bat an eye on it cuz that character's \textbf{ethnicity} was insignificant. I think this is the reason why ppl were okay with Hermione played by a \textbf{black} actor.Now, how many Asian characters are portraited by Asian actors in America cinema? Very little. And how many Asian characters are portraited by non Asians? Quite a lot. This is the problem and form what you said, I think you agree. But the fact that Ghost Shell developers didn't even think about the possibility of casting Asians and went straight to Scarlett Johanson is a problem. Btw, SJ is hot, but not really a good actor with wide range of acting. If the role went to Anna Hatheway or J-Law, then I would agree that the role is in the hand of a good actor, but still won't justify the white washing.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Ethnicity, Nobody & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}6/379 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.583 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@ExThinker "Secondly in Ghost Shell, whether the characters are human or not, they are supposedly Japanese. If you look at all humanoid androids being developed in Japan, they all look like Asian or manga characters, while the ones being made in America look like Caucasians or cartoon characters."Firstly, there's a lot about the world of the Ghost In the Shell we're not privy to. You don't know how many bodies are artificial shells and how many aren't. As such it seems odd that you're able to pick out which characters are inhabiting fleshy asian bodies, and which aren't. Second, there's a rather odd situation with the manga universe and the film universe. They seem to have different art styles entirely. This was captured best, by some person on the internet who was talking about the Puppeteer shell. Many people agree that it looks "white." But then, what happens is that the face is then compared to the Major's face- and it looks quite similar. This is of course somewhat different from the original vision of having the major inhabit an "inconspicuous shell." And then there's the general issue of how it's pretty hard to tell \textbf{ethnicity} in manga/anime/based on appearance (How many people have eyes that take up half their face, or have naturally purple/pink/blue/green/etc. hair? Why does everyone have the same head shape?).Plus we really don't know if the Major is Japanese, or even of "full" Japanese ancestry. We're pretty much left in the dark, except knowing that she was active in Europe and America. I personally wouldn't have gone with Scarlet Johansson (she rubs me the wrong way, like my brain is signalling that there's something wrong with her). But at least we did not get Jamie Chung playing her. Besides using a Chinese-american, for the role of a Japanese character, which would've been a whole other backlash altogether. There's also the issue of her being a bad actress.Third, the Hermione thing seemed to be heavily implying that she was not of relatively recent \textbf{African} descent. There are passages where it is mentioned that she gets easily tanned during the summer, her hair is bushy and brown. In fact, I rather disliked Emma Watson portraying her. Hermione's not supposed to be attractive- until the Yule Ball. She did not have the noticeable buck-teeth, which was quite heavily mentioned in the first book- and I think one of the later titles (where she shrinks them). And whitewashing \textbf{y\textbf{e\textbf{llow}}} characters is sort of a non-issue for a lot of asians. A lot of us could care less-its sometimes creepy when there is a general tendency to simply start rewriting characters and stories, but that's not unique to whitewashing. I had larger issues with the film Argo, and how it marginalized the role of non-American nations, and ended off with the note that what really happened was that the USA did everything.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African, Ethnicity, Yellow & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Asian (East- China, Japan, Korea, Philippines, Vietnam), Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Nationality - Chinese, Nationality - Japanese & \cellcolor{green!5}5/483 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.035 \\  \hline

Repeating what you already said by not taking account of my assessments do not justify ur point better.2. You are saying that \textbf{ethnicity} of Manga characters is ambiguous because of the drawing styles. Agreed for the reasons that I already mentioned, but it doesn't mean it justifies guessing the \textbf{ethnicity} of a character based on the drawing style. Manga style is a drawing style which does not accurately represent \textbf{ethnicity} of anyone, thus using a drawing style to justify whitewashing is flawed. It seems like that's why you even mentioned Manga drawing style which I find extremely appalling.3. Okay ... why is that still being mentioned? It is a bad example, period.4. Alright then, I and MANY ASIANS care about whitewashing and it needs to stop.5. ummm, haven't seen the movie so don't really what the story is about and how Matt Damon's character got involved, so not sure what to say about this.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@ExThinker 1. I'm pretty sure I did take into account what you said. "Naturally and usually the appearance of a cyborg is influenced by the culture and tradition of the respective location" That's what I was addressing with my bit about plastic surgery/etc. The point about culture and tradition influencing the design doesn't seem to be decisive for either side. But that was meant to address part of your point- largely the the creator(s) being silent doesn't lead  one to assume that culture argues for a japanese intended look.So, I'm a person who was introduced to the universe through the films. When I think of the major, do I doubt she's Japanese? No. Do I doubt that she was once a Japanese girl/woman/whatever before her shell? Nope. Do I think her \textbf{ethnicity} was even important to the story? Nope. Do I think they had to mention it explicitly? Nope. In complete agreement with you until here. But, do I think her shell was meant to be "asian" (whatever set of phenotypes correspond)? Nope, partly for the reason I gave above. The other much larger reason was the opening to the first film. For some reason,that opening primed me to assume that she was not asian in any way. I'm not saying Scarlett Johansson, at all captures what I would've thought the Major "ought to" look like, but that's another issue. I'm sorry if you think I didn't address your point, I think I did. I'm not sure there's anywhere to go from here-even if you were to believe that I addressed your point. We might simply disagree. Feel free to disengage on this point if you don't feel it's the effort.2. This point I admit was really intended to respond to a misreading of your second paragraph.My point has some use for the first comment I responed to, but not your second comment. I skimmed the paragraph, and I apologize for that. We're in agreement on the use of visual style being an insufficient indicator of race/makeup of body/etc. 3. I tend to mention things that aren't necessarily crucial to the point being discussed, especially if another person brings it up. Since its an internet discussion about something where our discussion really won't have any impact, I don't really care if I go on tangents. Feel free to ignore it. 4. Eh, don't got much to say. People have different stuff they care about, I'm sure we have different moral priorities/principles/and view different things as issues and non-issues. 5. Just mentioning it because it seems to be the next movie/piece of work that people are saying that is guilty of whitewashing. Some argue, based on the trailer footage or whatever, that it looks like Matt Damon is the protagonist. Based off this they're worried about the whole white saviour thing (see Dancing with Wolves). Others have responded that this might be less like Avatar or Dancing with Wolves, and more Last Samurai (not Oba: The Last Samurai). Matt Damon may simply be a spectator and lens for the audience.Some are wondering what a European is doing around that period in Northern China. Others say that Europeans (Russians, I believe) served in the Chinese armies, although it was a rare sight (I don't know about the historicity of this claim).\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/552 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.181 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I don't think Death Note was a good idea to bring up though, considering that the angle they are going for is a localized live-action version set in the US. All the names are even changed. Just like how Light from the manga was supposed to look like the average Japanese teenager, the Light from the Netflix show is probably supposed to look the same - and technically speaking on average someone is more likely to be white in the US than Asian. I'd just like to point out here that bringing up Japanese media as examples here is pretty stupid (not counting how stereotype-focused Japanese media is) - even in the case where \textbf{nationality} isn't expressly stated, or it's heavily implied (or even expressly stated) that the characters aren't Japanese in manga/anime, people still expect those characters to be Japanese (look at Dragon Ball, where the characters were never expressly said to be Japanese - in fact Japan doesn't even exist in the Dragon Ball universe) - no one made a fuss about AoT's characters being all Japanese - despite the characters expressly being stated to be German by word of God - because they understand it was localized for the country it was made in and most of the big stars in Japan are, well, Japanese. Same goes for here in America - the country is majority white, so having the majority of popular people be white also fits with this sentiment. Localization is something that everyone has to deal with, whether they're American, German, Japanese, a video game fan, a book fan (although rarely does localization happen with books), a movie fan - it really doesn't matter. Localization happens to appeal to the broadest amount of people. If something like Ghost in the Shell is localized, it doesn't matter if the original character was Japanese, the director  writer might have something else in mind.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nationality & \cellcolor{green!27}Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/318 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.314 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@ExThinker Actually I was going off of the first ~five to seven comments, as the first part of my comment was directed towards those. The second half was directed towards no one in particular, however. All that said, I'm normally better at things like these, right now I'm pretty tired, although I never once said they aren't considered locals, I said they were the minority and thus not the average person - the average person in the US is white, considering over 50 of the population is white. It's not \textbf{racist} nor saying that minorities are not locals by saying that white people are the majority and the average in the US. Localization is making something from one culture appropriate for another, some things get changed in the process (or most things depending on the type of localization) - the \textbf{race} of characters tends to be one of those things (especially in movies), and localizations in particular tend to be aimed towards the largest demographic (not even necessarily the original target audience, or the fans of the original material). Considering the majority of popular actors/actresses are white, and arguably one of the biggest, if not the biggest female actors right now is white, casting her is probably best to getting word out about the movie.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Race, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/215 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.93 \\  \hline

You make it sound like it is White-centric despite America is a melting pot of many cultures and races. You stopped at a number of 50 which just shows that minorities are that minority. Why didn't they "localize" movies like Concussion while they obviously "localized" an Asian character from Argo despite both are based on historical event and people? If your argument is gonna be along the line of weight of the role, then well think about Oscar hands trophies to  supporting roles and Melissa McCarthy got nominated for her role in Bridesmaid while she wasn't even in half of the movie.This really reminds me of someone who said that ppl think it is okay to be \textbf{racist} toward Asians since we don't have it hard.

If a character's \textbf{ethnicity} is never explicitly stated, I think it's open to reinterpretation.

The story Colud Atlas was a lot about reincarnation and it made sense in the story to use the same actors for multiple roles. I didn't have as much of a problem with the makeup because they needed the same actor to play the different role for the story to make sense and they didn't just use white actors for all the roles. for example the white characters of Rose and Tilda where played by Korean actresses, one of Halle Berry's roles was an \textbf{indian} \textbf{woman}.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small A lot of crass, disingenuous comments here.  This is all about representation.

You know - in the movies people actually go to see.   It's the same with any \textbf{ethnic} minority in that respect.  It's still pretty bad for blacks, but it's even worse for Asians.  You're going to be marginalised.  You're probably going to be stereotyped quite a bit too.  So a role comes along specifying an Asian character - "Great!   Finally my general appearance /ethnicity will work for me for a change."   Nah.  Here comes Emma Stone or some other actor who's never out of work -  and robs you of your big chance.  It just stinks - it's wrong.  It tells young Asians -  we want someone 'Asiany' but not really Asian.  It can only subliminally tell you that who you are is not good enough.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Its funny that people think 'Hollywood' is akin to the 'illuminati' and has an agenda. Hollywood is a hundreds of thousands of production companies all competing for attention and funding - they are personalities that prefer to work with other personalities that are relatable and communicate and receptive to ideas. To get funding you need to attach a name to a role, a name that is commercial and is willing to do that role at that time in that place.\textbf{Race} has very little to do with, its only the racists that are emotionally attached to characters being any particular \textbf{race}. Some of this video seems to think if a book had an 'Asian' in it, then the movie should have an 'Asian' in it - when the book has been rewritten into screenplay format and very little thought is given to the \textbf{race} or geographic origin of most characters anyway - film is a collaborative process, if any actor walks into an audition and blows the socks off of the producers, well then they're likely to get a role because they are awesome - not because they have a particular ancestry.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Race & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/192 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.562 \\  \hline

Hollywood studios cast new actors and cut new versions of films for Chinese audiences. Virtually every political thriller or war film uses corrupt American insiders as villains because outside threats could be perceived as \textbf{racist}. Doctor Strange sidestepped Tibet because it might upset the Chinese film board, and the remake of \textbf{R\textbf{ed}} Dawn changed the original antagonists from Russians, Cubans, and Chinese to North Koreans.Really, the only American minority that should have a bone to pick with Hollywood are Middle-Eastern or Muslim Americans. Islamaphobia is still rampant in many parts of the US, and Middle-Eastern/Muslim-majority foreign markets are not lucrative at the box office. But Asians themselves?

Another is that this is a western adaptation and 77.35 of the population of america is white,  this would mean from a business standpoint pandering to the majority would be a more financial move.Also avid anime fans will know of many characters who are not Asian from anime cast as Asian in live action adaptations. as an extreme example the live action Attack on Titan, in the anime which is set in alternate Germany there every character is European bar one Mikasa who even then is half Asian, but as the film was for Japanese viewer they cast Japanese as that us who they were selling to.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small +Paul Olugbusi This is blatantly false. Although the subject of the \textbf{race} of the Ancient Egyptian peoples is heavily contested, there are a few things we do know. The Ancient Egyptian languages, which are attested and well-studied, were Afroasiatic, belonging to the same linguistic family as Hebrew and Arabic, the latter of which is spoken in Egypt today, and both of which are currently spoken overwhelmingly by Semitic peoples (who form a subdivision of the Caucasoid \textbf{race}). Second, in classical depictions of Ancient Egyptians by themselves, there is an overt contrast in complexion between them and the Nubians who had some heavy involvement in the ancient history of the region (they are much darker).On the whole, Ancient Egyptians, may have had some native \textbf{African} admixture, but it certainly does not account for the majority, and typically would not account for more than about a third. Modern Egyptians, who were culturally and genetically influenced by the Arab conquests of the last two millennia, do not have more than 20 Negroid DNA on average.Instead of trying to hijack other cultures and peoples, why not try to find pride in your own? Africa is an incredibly diverse region. Even if Egyptians were mostly Negroid, they would be much less closely related to Xhosa or Yoruba peoples than they would be to Sudanese or even Jews, and incidentally, most \textbf{African}-Americans, who claim largely West-\textbf{African} decent, would not be able to boast Egyptian kinship.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}African, Race & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/241 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.245 \\  \hline

And the success of Chinese martial arts movies, or derivatives such as IP man demonstrates that there is most definitely a market for Asian actors in Hollywood movies. The thing that people apparently don't understand, is that one, Asians are a very small minority 5.6, and that of the population acting isn't exactly strongly preferred. So at most you'd expect 5.6 of actors to be Asian. Though you'd expect fewer of them to be top actors. This isn't \textbf{racism}. That is just the result of living in a country with a small Asian population. Same thing with that stupid "\textbf{Black} actors are underrepresented in media and oscars" except that A) their over represented in media, especially in high paying or high status jobs and B) if you actually look at the statistics it turns out that \textbf{Black} actors win 14 of Oscars, roughly the same percentage that \textbf{black} people make up of the  U.S..\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Racism & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}4/179 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.235 \\  \hline

For example, most country clubs in Los Angeles had policies explicitly excluding jews, it was unacceptable for an actor or TV personality to use a jewish sounding name, and holiday celebrations depicted on TV are still almost exclusively the secular christian ones. The first show I can think of to have an exclusively jewish character and to depict a jewish holiday was "The Wonder Years".

And you can't condemn only a select few actors for putting on makeup to play a different \textbf{race} when the entire cast is doing the same thing. It is perceived as hypocritical. A little extra narration or a note saying you didn't agree with any of the casting choices in Cloud Atlas would have gone a long way to fight that perception.I think you should have saved Cloud Atlas for a video, say, about where we've had the opportunity to include Asian actors but have failed to do so.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I don't see why \textbf{race} swapping is such a big crime. 99 of the time the \textbf{race} swap is not in poor taste, the other cases are usually for comedic reasons, which do work (sometimes). I mean, what's comedy without being offensive?The truth is that actors alone can sell movies based on their popularity with audiences- that's why we always see the same people in movies and why they're paid so gd much. Unfortunately, popularity doesn't mean diversity.  White people happen to be on the top because Hollywood is a western, mostly white, institution that makes entertainment for a western audience. There are popular non-white actors but they're so rare that we often get sick of them because they're in every movie that requires that \textbf{race}. I mean, how many movies has Sam Jackson or Morgan Freeman been in? If you need an \textbf{old} \textbf{black} man, you cast Morgan, if you need a \textbf{black} man with a 'tude, you cast Jackson. That's just how it works. Unfortunately, Asians don't really have a Jackson or Freeman. At best they have martial arts characters (that don't fit in non martial-arts roles) or Lucy Liu. Be grateful that you're not Native American, as I think there may be 1 Native American actor in all of Hollywood and I think he's been in every single movie that has Native Americans.  Anyways, even if it is ridiculous or offensive to \textbf{race} swap, people should still have the right to make movies any way they want. If you don't like it you can make a movie with Asians playing white people- just be aware that it probably won't help your profits unless you're selling it to an Asian audience.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Old, Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}7/284 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.465 \\  \hline

These movies featuring Asian characters can't be expected to cast Asians because their are so few wealth-generating Asians to cast. The reasons for this from what I can surmise) are twofold: 1.

These are all shown on the first episode and are certainly not the only dramas depicting stereotypes. There are so many stereotypes about other people in famous Asian movies/dramas but it seems to go unnoticed even though it makes a huge impact on how the Asian society looks at different races, religions, etc. as Asian countries are not very culturally diverse so most likely the only impression they can make about other people are from entertainment.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Druggie, Fat, Race & \cellcolor{green!27}Behavioural Addiction - Drugs, Ethnicity - General, Physical Identity - Physical Features & \cellcolor{green!27}3/207 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.449 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small +Chloe Bear Thank you!  People in this conversation often like to pretend context doesn't exist.  It's not single instances that are the problem (although often, they are problematic of themselves, indicative of casting calls that explicitly lock out pocs, the belief that only white characters will draw audiences, and the roles often include racial stereotypes)- it's the pattern being critiqued here.  Also, Hermione's \textbf{race} was left ambiguous in the books- even JK Roling said in a tweet that she never specified.  She's described only as having bushy brown hair, freckled skin, and when she's younger, big teeth.  Casting a \textbf{black} \textbf{woman} to play her isn't going to change anything about the character.  There's \textbf{nothing} about Hermione's experiences that could be better or more accurately portrayed by someone with the experience of being white, either, unlike, say, Emma Stone in Aloha, where a mixed \textbf{race} actress would have been able to bring actual lived experience to the role.Excluding minorities from roles creates an echo chamber: white people write the roles, and white people play them, and white people absorb them, and the chance for actual stories about poc are lost, and considered not important, and are seen as less good because they are different (read: more accurate) than the white version of those experiences.  People become disinterested in investing in minority characters because they are never put in compelling leading roles, and then producers feel justified not casting poc because they those movies won't be successful, so they never give them a chance.Honestly, I think waiting for audiences to be "ready" for poc leads is stupid.  It's never going to happen if we aren't presented with them.  And there have been recent successes: Star Wars had a \textbf{black} lead, and was an enormous success.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Nothing, Race, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}6/295 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.034 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small When we're talking about comedy I think the argument is moot. The point of that kind of comedy is the same as that of a single comedian being able to pull-off exaggerated caricatures of individuals. If a comedian is good at it I don't mind my own \textbf{race} being made fun of, unless they never make fun of anyone else. I laugh just as much when Americans are painted in a comedic stereotype on Japanese or Korean television. As for movies where the entire cast is supposed to be a different \textbf{race}, it's generally impractical to assemble an entire cast of authentic foreigners, and even if you do, it's still inauthentic to have them all speaking English. Certainly any very significant historical person should be played by someone that at least resembles them. Where I draw the line is where the integrity of individual roles (often lead roles) absolutely depends on their being a certain \textbf{race}/nationality, which I do not think it does in the case of Motoko Kusanagi (her \textbf{race} and and name could be changed without it affecting the character in any serious way), but absolutely does in the case of Goku whose whole essence is deeply steeped in the culture that created him.

Also, no one is surprised that in the 40's and 50's, there was no such thing as political correctness.

When you complain regardless of context you just end up advocating in favor of \textbf{racism}.  At some point you aren't actually doing any good for racial diversity, and just letting disingenuous con artists profiteer off your good will.Take Cloud Atlas for example.  That movie's whole shtick was that they used the same actors over and over in multiple timelines.  But somehow that unusual and interesting bizarre creative choice just gets labeled "white washing".The Last Samurai.  Tom Cruise' character was an AMERICAN, who was based on a REAL LIFE FRENCHMAN.Doctor Strange having Tilda Swinton play an originally Tibetan Stereotype character is an example of the dark side of globalization and economic diversity.  China becoming a world economic super power means that we now have to take their tastes into account, and they're really prejudiced against Tibetans and mysticism and generally made the US look like a paradise of diversity and equality (A lot of countries do actually).Aloha:  It was a major plot point for the character that she looked white.  I LIVE in Hawaii and I had a Hawaiiana teacher in high school who had the same issue.  If you're going to complain about this movie complain about the fact that I didn't even see it because the trailer made it look like all the characters were supposed to be 100 ethnically white.And now Ghost in the Shell.  Motoko Kusanagi is a \textbf{woman} with a fully prosthetic body.  Depending who you ask she literally has no biological parts at all and her consciousness was transferred to a cyberbrain, leading her to wonder if she was ever actually human to begin with, or just an insanely advanced android.  She was transferred into an inorganic body as a child, due to a catastrophic accident and has no memory of her life before then.  Motoko Kusanagi isn't even her real name.  Scarlett Johanssen has played \textbf{Black} Widow for the last few years, who is superficially a slightly less badass version of Motoko Kusanagi, and she even kinda looks like her.  She's the best actress I can think of for the role.Obviously that doesn't mean there isn't a problem overall in Hollywood when it comes to casting and racial representation, but as a gamer who cares about \textbf{sexual} equality I had to stand by and watch as Anita Sarkeesian made a mockery of both feminism and video games, didn't even finish her series, and triggered a resurgence of of reactionary bigotry, all to line her pockets.

IMHO regardless of the role is two people are available to play a role you go with who can give the better performance and NOT who happens to have a more convenient skin tone.   Holywood is only one market and it has plenty of actors who  have proven their worth as assets, so why should they cast some dubious person just because they want to appease someone that might take offense to the fact their fictional character is being played by an american/european instead of a japanese/asian etc?  that makes no sense.Also I have the Peter sellers movie you listed, Ive watched it frequently...  You should realise that he was dedicated to performing as well as a comedian/writer by trade.  He took that role as seriously as he would were he a stage actor playing hamlet, he went to alot of trouble to undergo the character \textbf{transition}.   Dont dismiss his or other serious actor's effots just because you'd rather see an \textbf{indian} playing an \textbf{indian}...   otherwise you'll have to question the flip-side...  Like why Bollywood only cast indians when they are playing \textbf{african} americans.   Have you ever seen the bollywood versions of well known movies?

It's not as if we live in the days of 'blacking up' (or whatever the 'yellow' equivelant is), and I'm not aware of any kind of yellow-spolitation. it is simply and clearly an issue to do with human resources....    In a \textbf{nation} (US) where there is an abundance of european actors it should be obvious that there is going to be an over average of europeans on screen going for roles that require them to actually ACT rather than gain merit on the fact they happen to share a skin tonal similarity with the character(s) in question.And I'm aware of MANY 'asian' actors.

If the character is changed to a white American and the setting is changed to America, then that's just all part of the Americanization of the franchise, which is acceptable for a deliberate American remake.Remember, there's been numerous Japanese versions of the story where the character is Japanese already. There's no sense in making an American version if everything's going to remain Japanese.

Nevertheless, the point I was trying to make is that Vox only fixated on the 'issue' of that a white actor is playing a character with an asian name. Thats also another issue I have with this video. They use it as an example when in Ghost in the Shell we don't even know what \textbf{race}, The Major is, just that she has a Japanese-esque name. All of that shouldn't matter anyway because the idea that assigning people 'roles' that only they can play because of \textbf{race} is somewhat \textbf{crazy}. Personally, I dislike the idea of any 'role' should be determined by skin or any other basic trait. When actors are cast, as well as any other job, the only thing that should matter is how good at said job that individual is, not their skin color.Overall, my issue is that Vox didn't really delve too deeply into what is going on and went straight for an 'Hollywood is \textbf{racist}' in an attempt to stir the controversy pot. They didn't actually bring up any real examples of white washing and attempted to make Hollywood seem \textbf{racist} for having good business practices.

That China isn't going to be big on allowing a movie that has pieces of the subjugated Tibetan culture in it. So making the character white and female removes that issue.This theory is lent credence by the face Zootopia got blasted by the Chinese Government's press for it's plot, mainly in that a rabbit can become a cop, as it goes against Chinese party doctrine that society has distinct ceilings and lines you can't cross, that you are born in a position and are stuck in it and should be happy.

That leads to the fighting in the comments etc etc. The real issue, in my opinion, is that not everything is being considered.

What I was trying to get at is that Vox, as well as other news agencies and people skew things to make them appear \textbf{racist} to stir the pot and get people angry for attention. \textbf{Racism} is pretty cut and dry if you follow what it is defined as and don't misconstrue it as things such as 'microagressions' at which point it just down to peoples opinions and actual \textbf{racism} loses its meaning. I digress, to put it simply, we don't know why Scarlett Johansson was cast but I assume that it is because she was the best actor to be cast for the role, not because she is white and there were other better asian actors. As a result there really is \textbf{nothing} '\textbf{racist}' to be found in this situation except Vox claiming that there is, which they can't really back up without proof. Doesn't mean that representation and other racial issues don't exist, just means that in this situation its Vox just fanning hate flames.And if you don't believe me, take the word of the publisher of the Ghost in the Shell manga, Kodansha. The international business director, Sam Yoshiba, said in an interview that "Looking at her career so far, I think Scarlett Johansson is well cast," Yoshiba said. "She has the cyberpunk feel. And we never imagined it would be a Japanese actress in the first place. This is a chance for a Japanese property to be seen around the world." Sorry bout the rambling, wasn't very succinct.TL;DR: While its not exactly \textbf{racist} to claim \textbf{racism} in a situation where there is none, like here, it is naive to believe such claims without evidence.

Some directors mostly chose well-known actors, whether they were good or not. In the past, most actors hired were white, regardless, so of course the most well-known would be white. People paid money to see a well-known person rather than a new-time actress. But good? Ha! Many of these actors were not good at the roles they portrayed. \textbf{Race} is a part of misrepresentation.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small +Progeny of Europe It's bad when they cast white people for someone who is a REAL Asian person. Imagine a movie about Marilyn Monroe and they cast a \textbf{black} \textbf{woman}. Uh, no.Heimdall isn't real. However, I don't believe casting a \textbf{black} man as Heimdall is right either, as it is based off of Norse mythology. It is misrepresentation, true. In fact, it feels shoved in there rather than making a TRUE \textbf{black} hero. As a \textbf{black} person, I was against it. But how many \textbf{black} men are in super hero movies anyway? The problem is that there is not enough representation of other races so they shove \textbf{black} actors in roles that are not "realistic" or represented well. There are few people of color in these movies, even in roles of their own \textbf{race}! I guess some people at least want a shot at Hollywood when it comes to characters they actually CAN portray.Hollywood thinks they can spare to put a \textbf{black} person in the role as Heimdall. Honestly, there are so many white people in Hollywood, it doesn't matter if one pitter patter role is played by a \textbf{black} man. But there are so very few \textbf{black} men in super hero movies and in comic books, they shove them in these roles. On the other hand, this video isn't just about HOW MANY Asians are cast but also how they are PORTRAYED, which is very stereotypical in most cases. To give a white person stereotypical "slanted eyes" and call them Asian is just incorrect and derogatory.It's hardly believable that ALL of these white people are somehow superior actors than ALL of these other races in the world. Really? Some of these actors seem selected personally and it doesn't seem like a fair audition happened at all.  Honestly, the stats are influenced by the fact that what white people find entertaining is different from what other races find entertaining, which makes the playing field limited for other races because white people make up the majority in the USA and influence Hollywood that much stronger. White people are simply not exposed to other cultures in a "dominating" perspective. They may show interest, but will hardly accept any other culture but their own as "normal".\textbf{Black} people, Asians, Hispanics, Native Americans, those from the Middle East can all relate to white culture and can easily watch movies with them in it because they have assimilated and been dominated by white culture, thanks to colonialism and other reasons. But for some reason, white people can't seem to relate to other cultures, like Tyler Perry's movies for example. Why is this? Because white people 's culture is the dominant and there is no encouragement from anyone in the world to encourage white people to look outside of their perspective. Hollywood reflects this attitude, if you're not too \textbf{blind} to see it.To think Hollywood is anything but fake is definitely naive. Hollywood often casts crappy actors in the Step Up movies just because the people are good looking and can dance. Acting skills were clearly not a part of the package. Look at the Twilight movies. Good looks were obviously chosen over talent. Hollywood is full of bias. But would we really enjoy a movie if it wasn't believable to a certain degree?

If skills was the issue then they would have changed the plot to make all of the characters white and completely forget that asian actors exist (which obviously is bad too). Instead, the directors deliberately chose to cast a white actor/actress to dress up and "act" like an asian character.

Caucasians tend to just have a bit more pink or \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} tones in their skin. I agree 100 that we need to stop casting caucasians for clearly asian roles. Especially if it has to do with a setting in an asian country like Japan. For Ghost in the Shell. The main Character is basically a robot and could be anything I guess. But it would have been cool to see a good Japanese, or Japanese american actor play the role. If they were trying to match the look of the anime character exactly then Scarlett Johansson isn't a bad choice. When anime was originally created, they tried to make the characters look more "white". If you look at the movie Attack on Titan that Japan has made it's about a bunch of German people.

Isn't that 'white-facing' or the exact crime your rebelling against?  Maybe you should worry about double standards. You don't dictate the art style of this character.

If you or the movie makers want to point to a backstory about her being ethnically Caucasian and being adopted or assimilated then lets see it.  But "I think she looks white" doesn't cut it.That aside you're ignoring my larger point.  There are always excuses.  Someone is always certain that "in this case" it's not \textbf{racism}.  Well when the end result is a consistent lack of casting Asian actors in Asian roles, it is indistinguishable fro \textbf{racism}.

We already know what will happen. As why if you are asking why White people barely appears in big Asian (India and China) Movie, China is Homogenous \textbf{Nation}, living under significant 1 \textbf{race} of people for milleniums and doesn't have significant number of white people, even virtually non existent, and their movie is intended ONLY FOR CHINA, not aired in US Theatre or TV but even in Chinese latest movies you see more White people around portraying some "BADASS LEADER" in Big Chinese movies (See Dragon Blade by Jackie Chan, Adrien Brody and John Cussack), the same reasoning also apply to India. While United States is originally inhabited by Native American, White people came and occupy their land and brought people from Africa, later from China. And nowadays U.S has significant population of White, \textbf{Black} and Asian and your government declares U.S as "multicultural \textbf{nation}". Not only that, your Movie is intended for WORLDWIDE AUDIENCES, we 7 BILLION PEOPLE OUTSIDE U.S can see your movies here in China and India, unlike Movies made by India and China which are largely intended for their people and not aired in U.S. DO SOME RESEARCH and you will find that China is now 2nd largest box office market for U.S movies and in few years going to be bigger than even your audiences, means we are buying your movies, and 60 of U.S Movies revenues came from ASIA. It means that we need some "FAIR REPRESENTATION" of us not WHITEWASHING it or otherwise YOUR MOVIE MARKET WILL FALL 60 AND FILED FOR BANKCRUPTCY DUE TO HIGH PRODUCTION AND ADVERTISING VALUE. While i can understand why Cloud Atlas \textbf{race} change through the movie and not feel offended by it. At least know this logic first, literally your movie actors, producers and directors can continue make movies because 60 of the money came from ASIA, so it means fair if we want at least only 1 Semi-lead non-stereotypical guy in your movie alongside 7 White and 2 \textbf{Black} actor. We have talented non stereotypical and popular actor known by billions of people to portray major roles such as Shahrukh Khan, Daniel Wu, Andy Lau, Kris Wu, Huang Xiaoming, Amitabh Bachan (Those people can replace Tilda Swinton as The Ancient One since the character was a male and "Nepalese" which could look \textbf{Indian} and Chinese at the same time), Fan BingBing, Deepika Padukone and AngelaBaby.

The role of an actor is to give the viewer a truly authentic experience in connecting with the character. I find it a lot easier and less distracting when a character is the same \textbf{race} that they're being portrayed as. Btw by the end of 2016 and into 2017 we're seeing 3 white actors take the roles of characters that were originally Asian. Those shows/movies being "Iron Fist", "Doctor Strange" and "Ghost in The Shell". That's only what I know of...there could be more.

And we never imagined it would be a Japanese actress in the first place.'The original creator hasn't stated an opinion yet.The people closest to the source material agree with the choice and didn't think it should be a Japanese actress in the first place.  So on what grounds is Scarlett not the right choice?\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Handicapped, Race & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}3/269 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.115 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Going to be honest here as an anime fan Hollywood's pick for actress for ghost in the shell actually makes a lot of sense not in terms of \textbf{race} but in terms of actually trying to make the film sell well. Anime still isnt somthing thats popular enough in mainstream media to stand up on its own for the most part with a few stand out exceptions so in this case i feel that hollywoods actully attempting to give this movie its best chance to do well  And honestly i find it a tad odd that anyone actully is buged by the casting choice in this particular movie seeing as the major can look anyway she wants white \textbf{black} Asian or other so its not really a problem who portrays her long as they do a good job. As for in other films ya totally valid and good points people are making but if we are talking strictly ghost in the shell if ya do your research theirs actually little reason to be buged by the casting choice i know for fact that most people in the anime community sure aren't buged by it. But thats just my opinion on the matter but i do know a few YouTube's in the anime community who have out right said they dont mind the casting choice at all so if anyone is interested in herring their opinions on the matter i will put a link to their vids.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/246 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.813 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small tl;dr: Yeah I don't want to detract from the issue here (which is real in many cases), but some of these examples are cherry picked and taken out of context. The two white actors in Cloud Atlas that is supposedly taking Asian roles is probably the worst example here (Awesome movie, highly recommended). The whole movie is about story lines and characters being repeated throughout history. You have a handful of actors playing multiple roles in different time periods (The 2 mentioned, Jim Sturgess and Hugo Weaving, each take on 6 roles). And you have Doona Bae, a Korean actress, who plays a white \textbf{woman}, a Mexican \textbf{woman} and an Asian clone. I'm not trying to create some false equivalency here, just trying to give context. Our racial history matters, there's a reason why something like \textbf{black} power and white power are not equivalent and the world would be a better place if we knew why and understood the difference.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small These kind of videos makes me less convinced of Vox's credibility and where they get their information for all of their videos. Using Cloud Atlas is definitely a \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} flag, as many before me have pointed out, is because they obviously did not even do the courtesy of looking at the films Wikipedia page and finding that these were characters reincarnated into multiple roles, all of different ethnicities and backgrounds.The second, is that the creator of the Manga for the movie this entire video was made for said that he didn't envision the protagonist as Asian in the first place.My third and last point is that it also gives no understanding to how the industry works. If you did not attach a name to this film such as Scarlett Johansson's, then there can be no guarantee that the film is going to sell tickets and so it is much harder to attract investment for it to be even made. If you try to attract investors for new clothing store, you'll get more investment if it has Gucci on the front rather than a name nearly noone will recognise because more people will go to the Gucci store (and it also has the track record of consistently being good ala Johansson's previous films compared to some suggestions, the girl from Pacific Rim's maybe 2 films)This is also evidenced by such films as Lucy, a stupid plot but got a name that could attract investment, thus provided work to numerous Asian and French actors that could now go further in their careers because they've now got actual notable work in a real movie.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Red & \cellcolor{green!27} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Ethnicity - Native-American & \cellcolor{green!27}2/274 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.73 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small +Clee4000 I agree. Gotta keep those things generally the same, otherwise it wouldn't be Ghost in the Shell. However I'm ok even if not every other actor is Japanese. The fact of the matter is that we may not have a large enough Japanese-American talent pool to fill all the other roles, and that's ok. Movie production studios in other countries also have this problem. For example, in Japan a movie based off a manga called "Attack on Titan" had a cast compromised mostly (if not all) of Japanese actors, despite the fact that there was only one ethnically Japanese individual in the story. I don't think anything is wrong with this however, because they just don't have the talent pool there to pull off a mostly Caucasian cast. As long as a character's \textbf{ethnicity} isn't an important part of there identity, I think it's perfectly acceptable for them to be played by an actor of a different \textbf{ethnicity} if said actor can effectively portray the character's identity.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/168 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.19 \\  \hline

There are Asian actors out there, and by continually casting Caucasians to take their place, the potential of many Asian actors is lost. For example, the amount of high profile Asian actors who aren't cast exclusively for extremely stereotypical and/or \textbf{racist} roles can pretty much be counted on your fingers, in fact, the only ones I can think of are Steven Yuen and maybe Lucy Liu. Talented Asian actors exist, perhaps give them a chance to thrive?On the other hand, I don't find Scarlett Johansen's casting for the Ghost in the Shell movie particularly damning; the beauty of that movie isn't the culture it comes from, but rather, the great plot line. It's whatever. However, casting a white female to be a Tibetan monk is a no go for me.

Also, "If you cannot see or understand why an anime character looks the way they do without automatically thinking "she looks white", that's your own fault" You are basically saying that anime characters can look the way they do, and still HAVE to be portrayed by an asian actor? I can draw three blocks on top of each other, give it an asian name/origin, and it would have to be played by an asian actor? Or if I made a \textbf{black} character in a manga, asian name/origin, he has to be played by an asian guy because there may be a dark skinned asian out there with prominent \textbf{black} features and not the stereotypical asian features??

Fans get really annoyed when that happens too. Like Cheese in the Trap? Bro, no one's gonna think he's not korean. But most of the time, if the script calls for a \textbf{black} dude then they'll just get a \textbf{black} dude who can speak, say, Japanese (like Dante Carver... Karver? or Julian Kang for white dude), because they'd rather their audience can understand him without having to read subtitles. But no, they wouldn't just get an asian guy to put on \textbf{black} face paint and pretend to be \textbf{black}/white/etc. as long as they have enough budget. A lot of foreign actors ask to get paid a lot more than native asian actors - because it's hard for them to land a role anyway - or the famous ones may not have a good enough grasp of the language (You know, like why Jay Chou for a hollywood film when there are other people who speak proper english whyyyyy - well, he is popular).

WE DO NOT KNOW.What we DO know is that the publishers of Ghost in the Shell DIDN'T PICTURE MOTOKO AS A JAPANESE ACTRESS.'Looking at her career so far, I think Scarlett Johansson is well-cast,' Sam Yoshiba, director of the international business division at Kodansha's headquarters in Tokyo, told The Hollywood Reporter (via AnimeNewsNetwork and RocketNews). 'She has the cyberpunk feel. And we never imagined it would be a Japanese actress in the first place.'The publishers of the manga are fine with it. The creators never imagined a Japanese actress in the role. The only people whining about it are the crusaders on YouTube and Tumblr, and I'm willing to bet 75 of them are white, too. As for Starship Troopers-- \textbf{NOTHING} ABOUT THE MOVIE HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE BOOK so why the hell would they be gung-ho about character races being accurate? The movie was NOT the book in any way. Seriously. Yes, Hollywood whitewashes a lot of roles, but you know what? SO DO OTHER COUNTRIES' STUDIOS. Turkish Spider-Man is Turkish. Bollywood Superman is \textbf{Indian}. Italy has cast Italians as Native Americans AND Mexicans. \textbf{Nobody} complains about this. \textbf{Nobody} says "OH MY GOSH! BOLLYWOOD IS BROWNWASHING SUPERMAN!!!" Yes, there should be more casting agents casting more Asian people, but there aren't exactly a lot of A-list Japanese actors running around Hollywood, either. Name ONE Japanese actress that could have had the same box-office draw in America as Scarlett Johansson and I'll be shocked. I can't think of any. Can you? And that's the bottom line. The character is of nondescript racial background. The publisher says she wasn't necessarily Japanese. Scarlett Johansson is able to sell tickets. This isn't a conspiracy against Japanese people any more than casting Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury or Idris Elba as Heimdall was a conspiracy against white people.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African, Indian, Nobody, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - Native-American & \cellcolor{green!5}5/360 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.389 \\  \hline

Not only that Neo-Japan wasn't multicultural at all not especially after world war 3.

The reason why the studio cast Johansson is not because they don't like Japanese, its because they need a big name on a project that doesn't have as big of a following in the US due to it being an anime. There are no Japanese-American actresses with that much pull (partially due to the fact that most actresses usually stay in Japan). And besides, Johansson's character isn't even human, she is a cybernetic being who, other than the name, isn't imperative that she is a certain \textbf{race}. It's not like hollywood films are the only ones to ignore the character's original \textbf{race} in casting, just look at the Attack on Titan movie that is being made in Japan. Guess what, the entire cast is all Japanese, even though there is only one person in the original anime or manga that was Japanese, so it's not just the minority hating executives.

Instead, they have greatly over-represented white ones. Blacks are 12.6 of the American population, and 10 of Oscar nominations since 2000 have gone to \textbf{black} actors. But just 3 of nominations have gone to their Hispanic peers (16 of the population), 1 to those with Asian backgrounds, and 2 to those of other heritage (see chart)."Your argument is akin to "look at how much diversity we have at this company," while failing to see the executive board is the \textbf{old} rich white boys' club that it always has been.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!27}3/173 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.734 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small This "issue" is very complicated, there are many factors as to why Scarlett Johansson is playing an Asian character. One factor is that the directors of this movie want it to sell and wanted a famous name to play the lead. Even a casual person who is not into anime might decide to watch this movie because they enjoy Scarlett's work or at least know her name.Another reason is because there are simply a lot more white actors/actresses as oppose to Asians in the acting business. Of course the directors might not have much luck finding Asian actresses to play the role if they feel that the person is not right for it. I find this video to be very hypocritical since there is absolutely no backlash when they announced that James Bond (a typical white character) is going to be played by a \textbf{black} actor. Much like how \textbf{nobody} is going against the idea of Hermione (another white character) being played by a \textbf{black} actress. Saying that the reason why Scarelett Johansson is playing an Asian character is because the film industry is \textbf{racist}, is simple and does not take any other factors into consideration. How about we cast actors and actresses based on their skill and not on the color of their skin? By the way, anime movies are not intended for anime fans just like how comic book movies are not meant for comic book fans. The reason why Wolverine is played by a 6 foot Australian as oppose to a 5'2" Canadian is because someone believed that decision will appeal more to the audience and generate more revenue.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Nobody, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}4/273 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.465 \\  \hline

India has a lot of diversity, but our racial diversity is mostly shades of brown/beige. i'm not too big into Bollywood but in Lagaan, Rachel Shelley played Elizabeth Russelland Paul Blackthorne played Captain Andrew Russel.Mokoto from Ghost in the Shell is a Japanese role. Even the name is Japanese and she is a Japanese Cyborg in the story who works for the Japanese National Public Safety Commission.

In such a plot, you go and put a Caucasian in and thats supposed to be OK?The argument isn't make your roles more racially diverse. The argument isn't make your actors more racially diverse. It is simply, make your roles racially accurate. If you are adapting a book with a white character, don't make them \textbf{black}. If the character is asian, don't make them white. And we complain that your historical whitewashing of the roles tailored toward non caucasians means other races don't much get a fair representation in media.The argument isn't even don't cast americans.

If big-name stars really aren't important in movies and animations, then it makes very little sense that they would hire a famous celebrity just so that they can use their voice in a movie.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@somewhatcompetent Indeed, that's why I say it has the right message. But speaking of this particular case with Scarlett Johansson, people get carried away with their personal issues with that casting choice. I'd like to clarify that I neither defend, nor oppose her presence in the film. I frankly don't care, despite that I quite enjoyed the 1995 film (never read the manga, unfortunately). People have that \textbf{weird} idea that this vague entity called Hollywood somehow owes them something. It doesn't. It's just a business, just a piece of pop-culture. A bunch of people gather around, act out few scenes, point a camera at it, add some visual effects to it, then show it in a theater. And you can go, and pay, and watch, or you can not go, not pay, and not watch. Thus, the natural business selection works itself out.It's just some audio-visual entertainment that milks a franchise, it's not gonna change the world or revolutionize anything. If someone wants to actually impact the society through film, Hollywood should be the last place to look for movies that do so. Shouldn't be a surprise to anyone - that town is only about money and \textbf{nothing} else.A person on the internet, no matter how disappointed or offended by someone's casting choice, just doesn't get to tell anyone what to do, how to do it, or not to do it. Just no. Now, is it not obvious that many Asian people are angered by such representation? Absolutely obvious. But no amount of mass anger will change what real actions can change. When it comes to business, speak with your wallet, not your mouth. Or better yet - make an example, make your own movie, if it comes to that, but don't just shout from the mountain, it never works, and often makes the shouter look silly. I personally don't feel like going to this movie, regardless of the reason. We can talk of nuances of right and wrong within this subject all we want, but let's see how this film does in the box office when/if it comes out - that would be a more substantial conversation.I apologize for possible typos or whatnot, I had a few drinks, and don't mean to sound like a douchebag, but videos like this seem to me a lot more whiny, rather than constructive. So, again, right message, a \textbf{common} personal issue many people take, I get it, but completely misplaced sense of entitlement, and a very narrow approach.Crap, that's a lot of words up there...\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Common, Nothing, Weird & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}3/427 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.703 \\  \hline

I've said this before, probably on another youtube video since this movie casting has been making news, when it was rumored that they were testing making Scarlett look more Asian through affects, that I'm honestly, not mad they casted her. She's been doing a great job as an action hero actor star person lol in recent years. I don't doubt her ability. But, the issue isn't her, it's lack of representation. If there was more of it, fine. I don't really have an issue with changing races and characters of stories and retellings. It's more like how I would've like to see more \textbf{black} people on tv and movies growing up and \textbf{black} cartoon characters, I feel the same for Asian Americans, and all the other races out there. Everyone deserves positive role models. I guess my stance on hollywood is that it's powerful in a sense that it's apart of the media, and the media has a way of turning public opinion. The only reason why people are more outspoken now, is thanks to the internet and education of the other part of the world. Yes, I agree one person shouting from a mountain looks \textbf{dumb}, like seriously, get down. But if enough people shout too it can make a huge difference. Especially when money is involved lol. I doubt (highly doubt) they would change the actors at this stage. But, I do understand what you mean about VOX and waiting for the movie to actually come out. I think people just don't want another Dragon Ball or Avatar haha!

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@somewhatcompetent I certainly see your point. Unfortunatelly, this is not just a Hollywood issue. It happens pretty much everywhere in the world in one form or another, where any kind of majority/minorities division takes place within the society. Sad to admit, but whatever sells, remains on the shelf. Interestingly, (and I'm just speculating, but willing to bet), if we go outside and just stop random people, and ask them about the issue, I'm convinced the vast majority would speak against whitewashing. So, I don't think there's a conspiracy. Probably just a broken market, that time might eventually fix.P. S.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small +Val Hakun You say Hollywood is just going to make movies to make money, and I think that's part of the point here. Videos like this are involved in a dialogue to change the perspective of the consumer so that he/she demands movies where Asian actors play Asian characters, and other similar things. You can say that it's futile to complain but the opposite is just to sit back, do \textbf{nothing}, and let the \textbf{racism} wash over our impotent, brainless viewing selves. I'd rather be incensed by \textbf{racism} like this, voice it until the film industry starts making less money, and then get the kind of movies that represent and include minority groups who deserve it.I don't really agree with your "speak with your wallet" idea, though. It's making everything about access to money in places where money actually comes to involve the values being represented (especially when certain minority groups don't have the money that white people do and so can't "speak" their interests in the same degree). I think our basic disagreement is on the point of money's relationship to the movies that get made. You think that film producers should have the autonomy to make whatever movie is going to make them the most money because that's business. I think that this money-making model shows an entitlement on the part of the film makers - they think that by showing films with white actors, they're more likely or entitled to large profits. I think that this view, as centered as is it on a single perspective about how to represent people and make money, is the real narrow perspective. If you want to paint this as an issue of making money, I think that people like those at Vox are trying to make it more profitable to make movies when people of color are cast as people of color.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nothing, Racism & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/313 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.958 \\  \hline

Additionally, like other commenter's I argue that Cloud Atlas is ok because the same people in different lives is the whole point (tho I personally don't like it because most of them look to \textbf{weird}), they have halle berry in white face for example.Having said that the examples like Argo, 21 or Air-bender seem clearly just \textbf{racist}. For me the worst is films like Prince of Persia or Gods and Kings were the incorrect \textbf{race} of the actors is as jarring (and frustrating) as grossly inaccurate set or costume design. Having a white guy playing an Iranian prince is like having a medieval suit knight in a movie about Caesar (maybe that's a bit of a hyperbolic example bit it illustrates the point). This also goes for movies who do this for liberal reasons as well like having, say \textbf{black} people in inappropriate roles in the 17th century without justification and therefore 'white washing' \textbf{racism} out of history.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Race, Racism, Racist, Weird & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}6/221 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.715 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I don't get this. They're complaining about actors being portrayed as European, as well as actors being portrayed as non-European. It's lose-lose. The fact is if the vast majority of actors in the country are European, you're going to either have to disguise Europeans as non-Europeans, or have more European characters portraying ones which were traditionally non-European characters. USA and Europe are predominately European population, so it only makes sense.Actors should be chosen based off their skill at acting for a particular role as a priority over what they look like. Sure it's great when they both match, but people shouldn't expect a certain \textbf{ethnicity} actor just because the story it's based on had that \textbf{ethnicity}. In my opinion doing that sort of thing is \textbf{racist} itself. People shouldn't care about \textbf{race}. That is what equality is about, not giving jobs to people because their skin color matches that of a fictitious person in a book. People are complaining way too much about this. The only actual problem whatsoever that this video showcased is racial stereotyping, and that only seemed to be a complete sidelined point to their main point that a European was stereotyping a non-European. Is it somehow okay for a non-European to stereotype their \textbf{ethnicity}? That doesn't make any sense.This whole video was ridiculous. Why does Vox even use/re-enforce the term "yellowface"? That sounds \textbf{racist} itself, and more important not descriptive. Asians do not have \textbf{y\textbf{e\textbf{llow}}} skin, so its completely illogical to call them \textbf{y\textbf{e\textbf{llow}}}. You want to be progressive? how about using proper terms like European, \textbf{African}, Middle-Eastern, and Chinese (or even down to specific regions countries like china or Scandinavia), instead of "white", "\textbf{black}", and "\textbf{y\textbf{e\textbf{llow}}}", which are at best misleading and ambiguous (ex. white), and at worst completely nonsensical (ex. \textbf{y\textbf{e\textbf{llow}}}, \textbf{r\textbf{ed}}).\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}African, Black, Ethnicity, Race, Racist, Red, Yellow & \cellcolor{green!27} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Ethnicity - Asian (East- China, Japan, Korea, Philippines, Vietnam), Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Ethnicity - Native-American, Nationality - Chinese, Nationality - Japanese & \cellcolor{green!27}22/300 & \cellcolor{green!27}7.333 \\  \hline

I don't know about you, but she doesn't even look remotely Asian nor does it ever state ANYONE is Asian in the series.And maybe the reason why a lot of white people are casted more than asians is because there are less quality asian actors than there are white actors? Movies are made to make money and a Ghost in the Shell adaptation isn't going to attract attention unless they have an already well-known actor who does badass female roles well.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small In the movie Cloud Atlas they used the same cast of actors in each of the five seperate story lines.  Meaning the core cast members each played at least 5 different roles in the movie.  For example, Doona Bea, a Korean actress, plays a Korean \textbf{Woman}, a Caucasian \textbf{Woman}, and a Mexican \textbf{Woman} at different points in the movie.  Halle Berry plays a \textbf{black} \textbf{woman} in parts of the movie, and a white \textbf{woman} in other parts.  And Hugo Weaving even plays a \textbf{woman} for one of his roles in the movie.  Yes, this movie contains actors and actresses in "\textbf{y\textbf{e\textbf{llow}}} face" as well as "brown face" and even "white face", but it wasn't due to \textbf{racism}, laziness, or any kind of insesitivity.  I have a feeling you either didn't watch the movie or if you did, failed to notice that the same actors and actresses were present in each of the five subplots in the movie.Don't get me wrong, I think Hollywood should be ashamed of itself for all of the other examples brought up by this vox story, it is truely egregious to, for example, cast Scarlett Johansson as an Asian \textbf{woman}, especially in this day in \textbf{age}.  I just don't think Cloud Atlas is among the offenders, because they had a bona-fide reason for casting the movie as they did.  And if you saw the movie, I think you would agree with me.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I am an Asian so I may just join this conversation. IMHO, hiring a white actor to play an Asian is okay (though hiring an Asian is almost always better for an Asian role) , as long as they look like Asian on the big screen, I don't even care if they use yellowface or CGI or whatever. Just please don't be like The Last Airbender, it is painful to watch a movie where it is so obvious an actor is playing a role not of his/hers \textbf{ethnicity}  deviates completely from its source material. If somehow you can't find a suitable Asian actor for an Asian role, just make an "inspired" version of it,  change some elements and make it logical explainable that a white actor should be hired. [I understand film studios need big names to sell tickets, and there aren't many "extremely famous" Asian actors right now, maybe except for Jackie Chan.  If film studios choose to hire "that famous white actor" to play an Asian role, that's fine by me. But I would like it more if film studios have the guts to hire a person more suitable for the script (i.e. an Asian in this case)]To my eyes, there are just 2 types of movies, good and bad.

People pay to make the films, they will not do so if they spend \$50 million on film that will only take \$20 million as people have no interest in the stars. There are many inferior US remakes of Japanese films (Tha Magnificent Seven etc), and they have made far more money because it is what the main audience wants to see.If whites playing \textbf{black} is \textbf{racist}, then so is blacks playing whites, otherwise you are beinga hypocrite and will try to rely on semantics and non-dictionare definitions of words to support your case.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Genuine question, if acting is essentially pretending to have somebody else's character and qualities, why can't those different qualities include a different \textbf{race}?

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small +SamTheShamAndTheCat Genuine questions deserve genuine answers! I think the reason it's disappointing when white people play non-white characters has a lot to do with the larger social and historical context in which white people have more power and have used that power in the past to subjugate minorities. So for example, at the same time that white actors in early hollywood were playing Chinese characters in movies, the US government had a \textbf{racist} policy forbidding Chinese people from entering the US. Combine that with the fact that non-white actors have a hard time getting good roles in the film industry, and it becomes really frustrating to see those roles go to white actors. In a world without the history of discrimination and power imbalance, you're right, it wouldn't be necessarily bad for actors to play other races.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Dillan Johnson I did not mean to say that you said that white women in general are more qualified (what a grammatically horrible sentence).One hurdle would be purely economic. In America and globally white people are the ones with the most wealth. Films with white leads tend to be more successful because white people identify more with white actors. And since white people are the wealthiest film producers target that audience (by casting white leads).If you look at the chinese version of the poster for the new Star Wars film, you see that they put the \textbf{black} actor in the background. Asians can not really identify with \textbf{black} leads.Therefore, would the wealth (within the U.S and globally) be more equally distributed, then film producers would take a lower risk in giving Asians a lead role. You see, I am not blaming that movie or the caster alone. The entire system is crooked.Another hurdle would be personal networks. A lot of roles are given to people you have personal connections with, people that are in your network. They often spend several hours a day to tend those networks and relationships. It is very hard to become part of such a network and build a own network. New people to those networks get recruited from people that are already in the vicinity of the network. If Asians happened to be a part of those networks in Hollywood since forever, then they would more easily get into those. I guess there are not many Japanese actors in films from Hong Kong, since they are not in the chinese networks.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!27}2/270 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.741 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Archsinner Firstly, Asians are on average, more wealthy than whites are, so I'm not sure what you're talking about. But even if you were right, you're relying on the assumption that white people are so \textbf{racist} that they aren't even willing to see a movie with an Asian in the lead role. This is a ridiculous assumption in the present day of course. There is no reason to believe that an Asian actor couldn't be just as successful as Will Smith, for example, who has played the lead role in many successful movies. So, I don't see that argument as valid. So next, the networking hurtle. Hollywood is literally the most liberal place in America. If you honestly think that a talented Asian actress would be excluded from certain social circle because of her \textbf{race}, you are delusional. Since when were white people not willing to befriend Asians?You are simply creating hurdles that don't exist in reality. You're fabricating this narrative that white people are evil and aren't ready to see Asians in movies, yet there is no valid evidence that could even begin to prove that. I, on the other hand, am making the outrageous claim that actresses are cast based on talent and that Scarlett Johansson is the best actress they came across the play this role.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Dillan Johnson Asian-Americans are not yet wealthier than white Americans. On a global level, Europe is still more wealthier than Asia.The gap is smaller than between other races and continents. Yet, I've never claimed that this is the only reason. It contributes to it.Regarding Will Smith. Even with him there are some \textbf{weird} things. In Hollywood \textbf{black} leads almost never have a white girlfriend in movies (exception for Will Smith being Charlize Theron in Hancock, who is incidentally also African-American). If the casting would not be affected by skin colour, then we should see more \textbf{black} man with white women romances in movies. The numbers are too big to be statistical coincidence. White people feel (unconsciously) queasy about those romances. My point being, skin colour does sadly play a role in casting. Compare how much money films with \textbf{black} leads make overseas with films with white leads. In America, the people are more progressive than in Europe or Asia and \textbf{black} communities in the U.S. are wealthier than \textbf{black} communities around the world. That being said, \textbf{black} leads are still the exception not the rule.Also, once you are part of a network, you get the roles more easily. Will Smith started a musical career that he turned into a television career. I guess there he got access to the inner circles in Hollywood. I suspect if he would have gone directly to Hollywood, he would not have been casted for major roles. His rap-career provided the basis.I never claimed that Asians were excluded because of their \textbf{race}. I'm guessing there are more hollywood actors that have been born in california than in the south-west. What I said, was that it is harder to access those circles when you have no connections with it whatsoever in the first place. People in the south-west have no relations with networks in Hollywood. Not because Hollywood hates the south-west,but simply because personal relationships are missing. Some goes with Asians.I'm not saying that white people are more evil than others races. All are equally evil and \textbf{racist}. I'm simply saying that white people have a advantage in Hollywood for historic reasons, not because white people are more evil than others.Also, I never said that Johansson was not the best actor for that role.

I think ordinary people who don't think about this stuff all day long have a hard time distinguishing between a good, relevant piece like this and hack opinion pieces. For example, the other day Vox posted a criticism of Kimmy Schmidt for Titus's \textbf{y\textbf{e\textbf{llow}}} face play. It was a grossly unfair hot take that deliberately ignored the context of what Kimmy Schmidt is as a show and the style of commentary it does. There is a legitimate feeling that some elements of the media are using throaty opinion pieces to silence reasonable disagreements. Disagreements that aren't \textbf{racist} but maybe do want some objectivity in editorials. Often the motivations of new media companies like Vox, Buzzfeed, Mic, etc. aren't based in actually solving racial inequality, they're focused on stoking certain uncomfortable cultural differences to drive clicks. So my point is that there will of course be outrageously bigoted responses to a piece like this but they're not always based in pure racial hatred like it appears at first. And the more moderate disagreeable responses certainly aren't. Often it is just ordinary people who incorrectly judge this to be just another example of that editorial overreach. The culture of some of these companies (liberal and conservative) are often so uniform that a reasonable amount of debate doesn't happen at an editorial level. Often there is one opinion that is never challenged, and because these new media companies are overtaking \textbf{old} media like the NY Times, Washington Post, etc. as our main sources of news, a lot of normally moderate people get quite angry about the lack of balance and have reasonable fears about our right to disagree without being attacked. Balance doesn't necessarily mean letting Rush Limbaugh write a guest post, but it might mean keeping someone on staff who at least values the moderate opinion.

If people are butt hurt about not keeping to the original material lets look at some other examples.I Am Legend (2007)  Robert Neville is played by A-List Actor Will Smith, even though the character in the book was white, doesn't matter because they got an A-List actor for the role and most people never read the book.Attack on Titan Live Actions Adaptation, though not Hollywood in origin still doing the same this video and many others are complaining about, that its every character save for one is supposed to be of German decent yet the ENTIRE cast is Japanese, why?  BECAUSE IT WAS MADE IN JAPAN!!!  The \textbf{ethnicity} of an actor is never questioned when casting, its the name of the actor, how popular they are and how well they fit the role.  Scarlet Johanson is a great female lead and has been in several action movies where she rocked the role.

You also have The Ring, The Grudge, \textbf{Old} Boy and tons of movies they could have cast Asian actors as, but it's never that. The comparison on the other hand fails because our country is built on different races living together. For a \textbf{black} person to play a white character is not SO bad because there aren't that many \textbf{black} actors who are in movies as any type of role. But 10/10 you'll see a white persona in a film or show. At least in my own experience. Other than that, the only time you would see a \textbf{black} actor is on BET or as a side character who has no development or is just the funny best friend.

I have never seen a good movie translation of a TV series that had a plot.  If you know of one please let me know, I would love to see one (not sarcastic).2) Those movies bombed not because of white washing, but because they were simply terrible movies. They had little respect for the IP, they hired cheap \& talent-less actors because they thought so little of anime fans they assumed that the title would carry it to success.Do you object to statements 1 or 2?---I guess I have to ask because too many people mix these arguments thinking they are the same thing.Are you objecting tot:1. The Ghost in the Shell movie in particular? That Scarlett J, won't play the role well?2. That actors shouldn't play character who are a different race/ethnicity than they are?3.

I agree with you in that the make-up was horrible and they looked like aliens, but I think that it doesn't deserve to be among those other movies, it's not the same reasoning behind them.Also, I'll bring up another movie you mention, The Martian. While Mindy Park was indeed a Korean-American character in the book, her \textbf{race} and heritage means \textbf{nothing} really in the movie, nor her name is distinctively asian, and it's not like there was a lack of asian characters in the movie.

I like \textbf{Black} Superman so I would love to see a movie on it, it would be very very hard to do though to get right\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Race, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/51 & \cellcolor{green!5}5.882 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Hanji Zoe We both would love that but some whites would not. The movie trailer would get a ton of dislikes and bigoted comments in the comment section.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@J. R. I like it how you put "some whites" to point out the white people when the easier way would just say some "\textbf{racist}", I have a \textbf{black} friend who hates \textbf{black} superman. For the trailer it all depends on how well it looks or if they hire someone not meant for the role not just because of his skin color.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/62 & \cellcolor{green!27}4.839 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Hanji Zoe At least I did say "some whites" instead of generalizing like many people do. Sure some blacks like your friend would hate the idea of a \textbf{black} Superman but you wouldn't find him typing bigotry rants just because he hates the idea.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!5}1/44 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.273 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small So is superman, but have him be played by a \textbf{black} dude and I bet you and others would be rioting in the streets. "He's an \textbf{alien}" is the weakest argument for anything, ever. Dragonball has tons of direct Asian references, to cast him as anything other than Asian is the wrong casting decision.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Alien, Black & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/54 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.704 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small +Granite What does that have to do with misrepresentation in the media?

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small +luuvnich I'm as white as it gets and I think it's disrespectful to the source material and any aspiring Asian/mixed \textbf{race} actors looking for big roles like in Ghost in the Shell only to be shoved to the side to be overshadowed by inner circle actors.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Race & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/46 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.174 \\  \hline
