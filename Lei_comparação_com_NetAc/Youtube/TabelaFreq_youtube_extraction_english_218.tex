Not just online white people face \textbf{racism} and also any other types of people throughout world however they look.Before civilised society most tribal groups from all over the world attacked other tribes and took slaves this continued up until the modern era's until it was out-lawed in agreement by all "civilized" countries across the world. Now we have certain \textbf{black} people using the \textbf{race} card as a weapon/tool for political influence and certain white people agreeing with them out of some unfounded guilt and are being used and manipulated. They themselves haven't committed a crime but bare the sentence charged of slavery.Especially in my country the UK the poorer white working class natives of the Island are being blamed for slavery even though it was the Royal Families and people with money who had industry throughout the world who were to blame for these practices but they are held up with high respect because they have money, fancy clothes, fancy cars, mansions etc and the same types of people today are using immigration for cheap labour and they are praised.The human \textbf{race} talking about morality is just a political game and the ones at the moment who look the most clean are the most dirty.Certain people want to be around other certain people, let everyone have what they what without conflict, it's possible, stop forcing a decision to choose to be either this party or this party.Stop beating around the bush and accept people want to be around different people and have different beliefs, we aren't all the same and never will be, we all deserve the right to live our lives in peace.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Race, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}10/346 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.89 \\  \hline

Homosapiens, what we are, first evolved on the \textbf{African} continent and they would of been \textbf{black} due to the sun's intensity in that region.

Don't feel as though this is anti-white just because it criticises white people.In a World where so many right wingers are convinced that Women and minorities are too sensitive, it's very ironic that you seem so sensitive to criticism.2) It's only okay to have racial preferences when you're a minorityNO: It is okay only if your preference doesn't stem from subconscious \textbf{racism}I think that what this tries to do is to examine how for White people, however, racial preferences for Whites are rampant; and to study why they are so rampant, and whether or not the root is subconscious \textbf{racism}.  3) If this where a study of \textbf{Black} people, they would've only chosen other \textbf{Black} peopleNO: In fact, if you were to line \textbf{Black} people up and not white people, they'd happily choose to date white people. I, in fact, have never met a \textbf{Black} person who said they didn't have any racial preferences, and ending up being in a long term relationship with another \textbf{Black} person. Why? Because \textbf{Black} people live in a World where Whites dominate economically, hold most of the political power, have beauty standards which are seen as universally superior . Most famous cities are win white majority countries, and history has been washed of any of its \textbf{coloured} presence (Jesus, the Egyptians), etc...; and White people make up most Nobel Prizes. Finally, the only instances in which \textbf{Black} people discover other \textbf{Black} people is through the shallow worlds of sports and music, or through the insecurity complex inducing exclusive reporting of \textbf{Black} crime and \textbf{Black} poverty; not any sign of \textbf{Black} excellence. Naturally, blaming all of this on 18th century White people is oversimplifying. But the reality is that this current world drowns \textbf{Black} people in the idea that they're inferior.  This translates into so many \textbf{Black} women wearing weaves, or \textbf{Black} africans bleaching their skin, or \textbf{African} American males' obsession with White women, for instance. Which is why this video would be completely different if it examined only \textbf{Black} people's biases.

Symmetrical faces are usually pretty but as far as meaning beautiful I'd doubt it, the most scientifically 'beautiful' \textbf{woman} in Britain is pretty but she is no great beauty. What do inbreds look like? Average people don't look inbred. They share traits with their population like many other places share with their own people.

It's also unconscious racial insecurity. In fact, if you were to line \textbf{Black} people up and not white people, they'd happily choose to date white people. I, in fact, have never met a \textbf{Black} person who said they didn't have any racial preferences, and ending up being in a long term relationship with another \textbf{Black} person. Why? Because \textbf{Black} people live in a World where Whites dominate economically, hold most of the political power, have beauty standards which are seen as universally superior . Most famous cities are win white majority countries, and history has been washed of any of its \textbf{coloured} presence (Jesus, the Egyptians), etc...; and White people make up most Nobel Prizes.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The question is whatever you perceive it to be. There is no right or wrong answer here, despite what school tried to condition you to believe. Is it right to prefer your own \textbf{ethnicity}? Why? Should you not strive to eliminate ethnical preference, since ethnical preference leads to the degradation of the individual? Do you yourself not wish to be treated as an individual, rather than a monolithic entity that is part of an arbitrary skin designation? Why would you expect to be treated as an individual, but not extend that same curtesy to others? Just some things to ponder.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small No worries about the "mess of words" :) I can get your meaning. For once, a little bit of debate with a slice of differing opinions without name calling and mud slinging. :)I think we all do have biases, even ones we are not aware of. I think this is what really contributes to us preferring a skin colour over another, or just completely dismissing a skin tone as potential dating material, rather than the innocuous "I like what I like answer". I think that answer tends to shy away from the idea that we have any choice and therefore no responsibility about who we are attracted to. However I assert that we have more control over such a thing than we admit, and that a lot of the time its other peoples influence over us that dictate our attraction, or who we are willing to admit to ourselves who we are attracted to. Take for example the man (or \textbf{woman}) who is of the mind that they are hetrosexual. Their minds will filter out the members of the same \textbf{sex} that they are attracted to, to maintain the idea that they are hetrosexual. This will continue until they have gained an awareness of self and realise that those same feelings of attraction that they feel for the opposite \textbf{sex}, they also feel for the same \textbf{sex}. I use myself as example, it has taken me twenty one years to realise I find men attractive. However I will not sleep with a man, due to my own fears of what \textbf{sex} would be like. I also find women incredibly attractive also and because of this you could accuse me of \textbf{sexism} which I think would be true, but I wont hide behind double talk and denial, I will hold my hand up to it. In that same way, I think that people are naturally attracted to people, rather than \textbf{ethnicity} (which makes more sense to me than being attracted to a specific \textbf{ethnicity}, since we have no gene for that) but we apply our own filter to decide that we don't want to find that person attractive, so we ignore the feelings. But even then, at some point, this will change. This is because our list of attraction changes over time and our awareness deepens. When you look back at the people you dated when younger and you think to yourself, whatever did I see in that person. As we \textbf{age}, our attraction widens.

Someone could be beautiful as hell but people will not only overlook them because of the colour of their skin but say a whole \textbf{race} is unattractive...wow.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Race, Weird, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}7/119 & \cellcolor{green!5}5.882 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small +Ebony 'propaganda' these countries have a white majority the beauty ideal is simply going to be white. Why would a \textbf{black} \textbf{woman} be the ideal beauty in a country that is mainly white? Also why would a white \textbf{woman} be the ideal in a mainly \textbf{Black} Country? It makes absolutely no sense. Also have you thought some people just don't get \textbf{sexual} aroused by certain races at all even if they tried? Just like a straight guy who doesn't find a man sexually arousing if u believe that \textbf{sexual} orientation is biological than it's so easy for finding certain traits sexually appealing or unattractive. European and American media are aimed at the majority of European and American media is shown in any country in Africa and pushing an agenda then it's the peoples own fault for falling for it (I doubt they do)as the media in Europe and America is aimed at the white majority in their country and the continent of Europe it isn't aimed at Africans or Asians so it's their fault for watching it's not aimed at them\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Sexual, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}6/181 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.315 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Ebony I I never grew up looking at white women and thinking they were more beautiful. The average looking white \textbf{woman} is exactly what it says on the tin but some people will gas it up because of her skin complexion and hair. If that white \textbf{woman} with blonde hair in this video who they voted "most attractive" was \textbf{black} with the same features but with kinky hair they would have voted her the least attractive hands down. We need to stop looking and trying to reprogram our brains to try understand why they find their people the most beautiful because in reality it is not the case. There is beauty in every \textbf{race}. I have seen this time and time, i was watching one of those street interviews and the \textbf{black} male interviewer was paying this thick white girl all attention whilst her friend who was right next to him who was \textbf{black} same shape a tiny bit more pretty got none...he kept in stating she was a thick for a white girl and shit and I just thought first, what a \textbf{weirdo}? and second what was the complete difference, bear in mind i see this all the time...if she was her friends skin complexion with weave would she have gotten attention...no i highly doubt it...this is the reason i  am not nor should i ever take a bunch of scattered men's preference's seriously because most of the time it just doesn't make any sense and it speaks volumes about them than it does a \textbf{black} \textbf{woman} asian \textbf{woman} whatever.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Race, Weirdo, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}9/261 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.448 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small HamishYou're wrong. In fact, if you were to line \textbf{Black} people up and not white people, they'd happily choose to date white people. I, in fact, have never met a \textbf{Black} person who said they didn't have any racial preferences, and ending up being in a long term relationship with another \textbf{Black} person. Why? Because \textbf{Black} people live in a World where Whites dominate economically, hold most of the political power, have beauty standards which are seen as universally superior . Most famous cities are win white majority countries, and history has been washed of any of its \textbf{coloured} presence (Jesus, the Egyptians), etc...; and White people make up most Nobel Prizes. Finally, the only instances in which \textbf{Black} people discover other \textbf{Black} people is through the shallow worlds of sports and music, or through the insecurity complex inducing exclusive reporting of \textbf{Black} crime and \textbf{Black} poverty. Naturally, blaming all of this on 18th century White people is oversimplifying. But the reality is that this current world drowns \textbf{Black} people in the idea that they're inferior.  This translates into so many \textbf{Black} women wearing weaves, or \textbf{Black} africans bleaching their skin, or \textbf{African} American males' obsession with White women, for instance. Which is why this video would be completely different if it examined only \textbf{Black} people's biases.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}African, Black, coloured & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!27}14/218 & \cellcolor{green!27}6.422 \\  \hline
