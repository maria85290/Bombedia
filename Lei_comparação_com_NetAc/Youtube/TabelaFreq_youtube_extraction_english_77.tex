What else do you want live your life be happy and enjoy every moment smile when you see another year be happy you're alive you're around your family friends or whatever you like doing not living 50 of my life I dedicated to plastic surgeries and try to stay looking young 4 ever YAHH. She probably be judging da fuck out of young women. Someone like her the biggest fear she got besides getting older or having a gray hair is for some young kid saying that \textbf{old} lady over there I guarantee you that would break her heart that probably would be the straw that broke the camel's back. Especially if they're at the restaurant and the waiter says yeah them older couple there are next she wants to stay looking young but it's not going to work even if you have a billion dollars and why is she trying so hard she wants to impress people she don't want to look \textbf{old} is her friends I'm the youngest looking one out of all my friends people think I'm like in my late 20s or maybe like 33 because all my other friends don't take care of yourself they you have nice clothes they are clean oh they're very smart they graduated college but you know they just don't take care of their looks. You can make any story you want in your brain and connect search up with it as long as it's a lot \textbf{old} yes a subject where \textbf{old} people are involved or when you will think someone will call her that \textbf{old} lady over there for example some to get somewhere just anything like that so I can go on forever but I felt like for flying until you for example because it looks like you're going to head that way so if you are not her then do yourself a favor don't grow up to be like her live your life yeah married have kids have grandkids don't be sitting next to your daughter and her kids which is your grandkids will be confused my grandmother got awesome flows that would look good on me that's what 18 year \textbf{old} would be saying LOL she probably would be telling people you believe that's my daughter now that's my sister but she cancelled my mom it's not working and like I said even if it does it will always you McKay Bruce Kardashian if that's his name Bruce from that trash  Kardashian life or tv or some shit.. it's amazing how you got to be is a whore and you get famous and make money these days WTF I thought the Kardashians were some actors or some Hollywood producers just cocksuckers and stepfather who became a a stepmother that's what's wrong. Also in this community of our country this new generation so many fathers are not around but also so many mothers are evil bitches that want to keep the kids and some I'm not doing it for money not all females want to keep the children so she can get child support some females don't even want child support they want the father to stay away and that's their mission but some mothers can't stand the father but they still want him to have a relationship with his kids even if he doesn't have a right on the court gives you 100 full custody she still will try to let him meet his kids and be there for them if he wants but unfortunately that's only a small percentage so do do that major collapse of Mother's keeping the kids especially the boys yes especially the boys being around a bunch of females since day one and only gets to see his father once a month some don't even get to see their father at all what happens then by the time they are 10 years \textbf{old} they're \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} when they're eight they start behaving \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} they grow up they become gays because that's all they seen his kids and that's who raised them a \textbf{woman} Can't Raise a Man they used 2 but.not this \textbf{age}. She keeps men around as she and her friends try to raise a couple of boys out of three 100 one will come out \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} 70 to will come out \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} but yes  90 of the reason why a lot of boys grow up and turn out to be \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} because they were raised by a \textbf{woman} who had other \textbf{woman} around her who was always getting dressed up and getting her hair done and had other kids who was girls so that boy gets confused and wants to do what they do so by the time he's \textbf{old} enough he will have a boyfriend by the \textbf{age} 18 he would have been slept probably with 5 other guys then he can marry another man LOL and he sure did his part of spreading disease STDs. ' why do you think they are spreading around faster than a wildfire because of the bisexual men which is the worst if you want to be \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} just be \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} sleep with men only there is \textbf{nothing} worse than a bisexual he sleeps with a man they poke each other in the ass.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Way too over-dramatic for my taste.  I would never buy a property from her!  The baby is too cute though!!  And she completely over-estimated the selling prospect of her property.  What she has is a co-op not a condo which means is that she doesn't really own her own property but a  share of the whole building and in order to sell the property, she has to get the approval of the entire building and because of that it's extremely difficult to sell co-op type of property.  This type of property is very \textbf{common} in New York especially the older ones.  She's a "billion-dollar" real estate broker and I can't believe she didn't know that.  Well the listing history exactly proved my suspicion.  She first listed her property in 2013 for \$24 million and then just kept dropping the price further and further and further and further down to \$17 million and she still couldn't sell it after THREE years. [LINK]   In 2016, it was finally sold for \$3 million from her ex to her.  My guess:  They finally have had it living with each other and she paid her ex \$3 million for him to move out!  LOL  If I were the ex, seeing how attached she is to the apartment, I would've extracted more money than \$3 million from her, at least half of \$17 million.  That property was supposed to be split half and half if it had been sold and it's not the ex's fault that the property is co-op and is tough to sell.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Common & \cellcolor{green!27}Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}1/260 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.385 \\  \hline
