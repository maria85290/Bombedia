  \cellcolor{green!27}\small If someone was to say that all \textbf{black} youths in London are involved in gangs you would, like me, accuse that person of making a \textbf{racist} statement. And the same would apply if someone said that all Muslim men are involved in grooming young white girls. It's not true. It isn't right. To make such comments against a whole community or a group of people ‚Äì simply because of the behaviour of a small number of individuals ‚Äì is unjust and tantamount to \textbf{racism}. If you agree then consider: why a number of EU \textbf{Remainers} feel it is okay to accuse 17.4 million people of being \textbf{racist}? Why it is that certain politicians believe it is somehow just, to imply that those people who voted to leave the EU are \textbf{racist}? To play the \textbf{race} card against any group of people in this way is in itself, an act of \textbf{racism} and such people need to be held to account.¬† mMpGGNuh42Q\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Race, Racism, Racist, Remainers & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Nationality - European or anti-Europeans & \cellcolor{green!27}8/161 & \cellcolor{green!27}4.969 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small We were told that \textbf{Brexit} meant we didnt want immigration. But that is a huge over simplification. My Doctor is \textbf{Indian}, my urologist French, my dentist Italian and Mechanic Polish. All of whom have settled into the UK way of life and have NEVER experienced \textbf{racism} at all. Nor have they ever been in trouble with the Police. But there is a demographic who will only be happy when the law abiding majority of the UK allow then to behave just as they please. They are also the ones that are hugely over represented on TV and in advertising (as if we will accept them if they are rammed down our throats). Yet any criticism of them results in cries of \textbf{racism} and worse. Never the less Merkel and the EU thought it would be a great idea to have huge numbers of these people flood in to Europe. We have seen what has happened in Sweden, Paris and Germany. The \textbf{Brexit} vote was a push back against this and a chance to say no! we only want people who are of real value to the country, not just a load on the welfare and Policing system.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@fanagot you need to look at the situation with different eyes.  I do not dispute that people like Donald Trump are demagogues.  (we have the exact same thing going on here in the US as the UK has with respect to immigration).  but we still need to look at this in the same way that a cartographer looks at a map:  with a disinterested and objective frame of mind.  To explain a little more fully, after world war 1 the victors decided to punish germany.  they were to be brought low and humiliated.  or perhaps I'm wrong.  perhaps the policy to germany was simply to ignore them.  in any event, fascism grew.  so after world war 2, some genius decided we were not going to let this happen again, and so the Marshall Plan was developed.  germany was to be remade into a modern liberal democracy.  the rest you know: germany became a successful liberal democracy...precisely because the allied powers deliberately decided not to humiliate germany again.  the takeaway for me is, don't let fascism grow.  do not humiliate the historic native stock of a \textbf{nation}.  If the native stock of a \textbf{nation} is humiliated, or rather, feels humiliated - then hit the pause button on immigration....  immediately.  on this side of the atlantic, the free trade, open borders and mass immigration love affair began about two decades ago with the signing of nafta.  and it has been open the floodgates ever since.  In 1996 about 85 of the US was white.  20 years later it is 65 white.  This is an astonishing statistic.  It is \textbf{nothing} more than population replacement, full stop.  by mid-century white america will be 50 of the population.  Again, this is a truly staggering thing to behold.  As an Irish American, I cannot really be against immigration.  but I can sure see how many people would be.  (as an aside, I happen to like mexican immigration. they remind me of the irish in that they are quite honest, simple and catholic).  in any event, my point still stands.  if you want to truly arrest fascism in its tracks, then you take on the frame of mind of a scientist, not a social justice advocate:  you look at how many immigrants are coming and ask yourself how much is too much before the white majority loses its shit and starts throwing bricks through windows.  Those are your options.
