  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I don't see why Marvel has to be limited to making popcorn movies.  Wonder \textbf{Woman} had a well written story and brought up a number of interesting moral concerns, including the moral ambiguity of World War I, raising it above the popcorn level and making it an intellectually stimulating film.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/50 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.0 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small It's not about the \textbf{age} of the audience.  It's about the \textbf{age} of the actors.  The actresses are younger on average than the actors.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/24 & \cellcolor{green!27}8.333 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I'm not attacking her.  I'm attacking Marvel being \textbf{ageist}.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Ageist & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/9 & \cellcolor{green!27}11.111 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I agree but she certainly be a main actress at the \textbf{age} of 50 like the male characters are.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/19 & \cellcolor{green!5}5.263 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The thing with Carol Danvers is she was probably ion her late 20s during the events of Captain Marvel.Endgame is probably 25 years later in the timeline of the MCU.  She would be late 40s early 50s.Also the notion of \textbf{ageism} with female actors is something that has been around since film began.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Ageism & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/55 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.818 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I would defend anyone other than Brie Larson regards \textbf{ageism} being a 42 year \textbf{old} white dude that I am (who won't ever be arsed enough to watch CM in any format anywhere). \textbf{Age} shouldn't matter hugely as Downey Jnr has proved but Larson looks washed out with her \textbf{weird} vacant stare. I tell you what I want now, I want Marvel to be stuck with Larson for 20 movies and never legally be able to have her removed from making an appearance in All related Marvel media. I think she should be everywhere.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Ageism, Old, Weird & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}4/94 & \cellcolor{green!5}4.255 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Why is \textbf{age} the issue? Keeping politics out of movies should be the focus!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/14 & \cellcolor{green!27}7.143 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Since I'm a male and automatically assumed to be sexist and bigot I can say that yes. If the they are going to cast a \textbf{woman} as the face of the MCU she should be attractive as both males and females prefer to watch attractive people. Attractive for women is young and beautiful. If she stays for for her complete contract she will be about 42. I'm done with the MCU with everything Disney is doing so yes,she should stay and allowed to speak her mind as much as possible.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/90 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.111 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small What is this list based on.  It seems quite selective.For example - you have included some big baddies in the male list (like Thanos/Josh Brolin 51), but have omitted to include the main female baddie of the MCU to date (e.g. Hella/Cate Blanchett 49).  There are a few older female characters too, like Nova Prime/Glen Close 71, The Intelligence/Annette Bening 60 and The Ancient One/Tilda Swinton 58.  This would bring the female average up somewhat.Also, why does Tom Holland not appear in the male list.  His inclusion would bring the male average down a bit.  Seems like a big omission considering he has appeared in 3 MCU movies so far.I don't doubt that the average \textbf{age} of the female cast members is lower, that seems to be the way with Hollywood - but it would help your argument if it didn't look like you were cherry picking.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/150 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.667 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Hi, I have picked the older characters who physically use their powers and I went through the Captain Marvel and Endgame.  The ages are not scientific but I think they do tell the picture...the selection of actresses is influenced by \textbf{age}.  If I would do it again I would remove Jude Law but he wouldn't change the average \textbf{age}.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/59 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.39 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small What do you think they should do over the next 5 years? I really like the look of Shang-Chi because \textbf{O\textbf{r\textbf{iental}}} can be very interesting.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Oriental & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Asian (East- China, Japan, Korea, Philippines, Vietnam), Nationality - Chinese, Nationality - Japanese & \cellcolor{green!5}3/25 & \cellcolor{green!5}12.0 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I think they first needs to look in the mirror, realize their mistakes and stop the pandering to special interest groups. They're too small to cater to and aren't loyal once you cross their wacko ideals. They're just not worth the attention in the long view. Product good material without any overt political bias. Create good stories and interesting characters. Stay as believable as possible. NO MARY SUES!  Hollywood has gotten so lazy in rolling out \textbf{dumb} sequels, and chasing after minorities. That's why people aren't flocking to the movies like they used to. Go back to basic storytelling.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Dumb & \cellcolor{green!27}Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}1/99 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.01 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small It should be. Even now she looks older than her \textbf{age}. Marvel and Disney will believe in their "equality" and feminism until they will lose millions and eventually their multi-billion MCU franchise.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/32 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.125 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@\textbf{R\textbf{ed}} That The reviews were messed with,negative reviews were removed,fake positive reviews by audience were added,official reviewers gave it forced positive reviews,there were charities funded to boost ticket sales and it opened it more cinemas than any movie and made less per cinema.Also the Last Jedi and Batman vs Superman made more money and were damaging to their franchise.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Red & \cellcolor{green!27} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Ethnicity - Native-American & \cellcolor{green!27}2/60 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.333 \\  \hline

\textbf{\Large Result analysis:}

\begin{itemize}\item Taking into account the words that were detected, we can reach the conclusion these comments are associated with : : Age - General;Gender - General;Age - Over 65s;Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments;Ethnicity - Asian (East- China, Japan, Korea, Philippines, Vietnam);Nationality - Chinese;Nationality - Japanese;Ethnicity - Native-American; Ideological and Political Identity - General;%.

\item The percentage of hate speech related words is 2.354.

\item Considering that the variable \textbf{Age - General} has the most occurences in the post, we can interpret that this is the predominant hate speech.

\item Overall there were 27/31 occurences of hate speech related comments.\end{itemize}\end{document}
