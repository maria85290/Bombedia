  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Jennivere Gospic I don't think you understand. Most older women that date younger men have no long term intentions with them. Usually these women have already been married and have had kids so their wants have changed. Usually they are just looking for intimacy, companionship and someone attractive and fun to be around and younger men completely fulfill that want. Although not all younger men have ulterior motives, their are some that do. But that's to be expected just as it is expected when young women date \textbf{old} men. Men realize that most young women are primarily into them because of their financial resources, but it does not in any way discourage men from dealing with them. Some men are so desperate for a younger \textbf{woman} that they'll endure her drama and all the cheating. So when you brought up JLO's situation, you failed to acknowledge that it happens to older men all the time. That example does not support your point.  Reality is that we live in a time where people are sexually out of control and have a self absorbed kind of attitude. Whether your a man or \textbf{woman} looking to date younger, it will be gamble as this generation and ones to come will be filled with very low quality people. And 32 and 19 is not a big \textbf{age} difference in my opinion. When she is 30, he'll be 42. 42 and 22 is a whole different thing.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Old, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}4/242 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.653 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I have to say something though. All these matured or older women were once a young \textbf{woman}. They too would have the "drama queen" episodes and every other situation young women face in life including insecurity. The reason for their maturity is because what life experience have taught them over the years. They grow stronger and more stable minded over the years. It isn't like they just become mature overnight. The same goes for younger men and older men. To some young women, older men are appealing coz they are much more manly and experienced. They  are more responsible and wiser compared to younger men.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small This is true. I've been pretty mature, direct about what I want, and striving to be a better and more compassionate but decisive person since my 20's...but it didn't seem to be something attractive to men in their 20's until recently, but I realized that was selection bias. The two things that improved substantially with \textbf{age} are my looks and making better choices of partners. My hormones aren't driving me to invest emotion in men who aren't invested in me, and I understand that loss is not the end of my world.

Also the ones that peak early in their life might look way different than even 5 years later and they'll find it hard to just use their looks for popularity, jobs etc. But some people peak in their 30s for some reason (women and men).
