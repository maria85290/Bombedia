\hline\cellcolor{green!27}\small It's sad to see that so many people here are happy to dismiss some of the terrible things said in this show simply because "oh they're geeks! They don't fit in and have trouble getting women just because they're quirky and nerdy, but trust me, they're the nice guys I swear." when the show literally has instances where the main characters commit crimes of \textbf{sexual} harassment. If the main characters were very masculine and confident (like 'jocks') it would come across as creepy and demeaning. You can't shut down everyone who calls out something you like by calling them oversensitive and \textbf{crazy}. Accept that it isn't right and it isn't fair. There is \textbf{nothing} wrong with believing that both genders deserve equal amounts of respect. Yes, men do get treated unfairly but no where near enough as women do, it's not a game of who's worse off, it's a fucking social issue. The show sometimes acknowledges the \textbf{sexism} of its jokes through lampshading, but there is a difference between acknowledging and trying to stop \textbf{sexism}. The writers lampshade jokes so they can get away with sexist and \textbf{racist} jokes without paying the repercussions. The examples in this video aren't very good in all honesty so try watching this video with an open mind :)  [LINK] \normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Crazy, Nothing, Racist, Sexism, Sexual & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}6/215 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.791 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I hate Leonard, he is meant to be good and not only does not help Penny with her acting career but always pours scorn on it and acting must be a career that those who try it need a lot of support with so the nasty attitude of Leonard domes her to failure. As series are full of actores, it is always umpleasant to hear the actors in the series down those who would be actors.   To cap this lack of caring, he has a good job while her job is a waitress  and they always tell her she is a bad waitress as well as not helping her to better hersself by becoming an actress, which would bring her up to their level as university professors.   On top of that, Sheldon and Leornard like havign her around and chase off any man who gets close to her but make her feel as if she is merely getting food of them, instead of making her feel good that they like her. Do anyhting they can to stop her leaving and make her feel as if she s the one who manipulates them. After all of this, she gets a job that makes her sad and makes her drink and leonard remains the goodey of the series though he does all he can to keep her in this high paying but dishonest and soul destroying job. He says his mother is bad but she at least made him get a high kudos job. that does not make him feel desperate. He says he loves Penny and keeps her down. his education also seems to allow him to hold his own with Penny and more or less with Sheldon even, while they all use and abuse Penny, enjoying her company all while they  pretend that she does \textbf{nothing} for them.  The program continuously makes reference to how soul destroying Pennies job selling medicines is and how she is conscious of this. I think it invites us,  the audience to complain about his behaviour but it seems we don't, because the Penny Leonard trajectory,  goes on being the same, about as sexist as the KIll Bill Beatrice Kido one is, in which, much as every thing we know about the relationship indicates that Bill controls Beatrice, untill the second last scene, all their friends say they hold the belief that Beatrice controls Bill, that she is the one who controles him. This fact, that he has convinced all that she manipulateds him, much as the opposite is evidente, mirrors real life in which men usually have more control of the life trajectory of the couple but not about putting their feet on the table, while they say that women control them.  Leonards teatment of Penny's situation and her hopes and fears, given her much expressed disgust of her role at wor, so her evident understand of how evil this job is,  is so mean that he is even begining to look more and more unattractive, as his nasty role just holds for longer and longer.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}1/512 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.195 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small It appears that if a female character's traits include being academically inept  then the entire show around it is sexist. By that logic , characterisation for females is strictly limited to portrayals of success. The show has other female leads that are just as attractive as Penny and boast an education far superior than any of you snowflakes will ever have (e.g Bernadette)I'm not surprised at all ; people have been changing the meaning of words just so they can further their agenda. Sad really.Next time you attempt to bash a sitcom with perfectky acceptable characters look for better examples because none of these clips exemplify how Penny has been belittled by the sole fact she's a \textbf{woman}.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small They really messed up with Penny and Leonard to be honest. The more I think about it the more I realise that Leonard is probably more interested in how penny looks then her personality. I think penny just wants to settle down and be loved somehow and therefore goes for the sweetest person to her who would never hurt her. I mean lets be honest her ex boyfriends have all been hot and \textbf{dumb} like her, why not switch it up and not get hurt by them anymore, not get cheated on and go for the safety shot. No offence to either of them but I think they shouldn't have gotten together because now they are boring and constantly trying to sort out their marriage.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small MÃ¡rk MoldovÃ¡n ..... so women can't have \textbf{sex} now... woah Victorian days flashback. I don't care about how many guys penny's been with, but since she's tired of feeling awful about one night stands she uses Leonard as a security blanket.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small If anything is it not sexist to say that a bunch of \textbf{old} men would be so startled by a pair of breasts that they'd automatically give leonard the job? Of course it's probably true but if anythig that's a power we women have. And how is saying this particular women has slept with a lot of men or this particular women doesn't understand physics sexist?

Basically the characters say a bunch of nerdy shit that we don't understand and that's the 'joke' I'm assuming. I'm sorry who's \textbf{dumb} enough to watch this crap.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small First clip- Fair enough. I do agree that that is sexist (even though the most raging feminist will weaponize her \textbf{sexual} appeal without second thought if she has the chance).Second clip- I'm sorry but a \textbf{woman} having \textbf{sexual} with so many men does indeed make her a slut. You want to know why society has this perception? Very simple. A \textbf{woman} has it A LOT easier to have \textbf{sex}. A \textbf{woman} is like a club security guard and men are like a line of drunks trying to get in. If you let them all in... Very stupid from your part. A \textbf{woman} can get pregnant, so she must be extremely cautious. If she lets just anyone in, she's not just a slut, she's fucking stupid. Also, if you ever see a man bragging about sleeping with high numbers of women, he is most likely a bullshitter.Third clip- How is that sexist?

This show is cringe worthy. The laugh track is heard more than the dialogue. The joke seems to be that the characters engage in sexist attitude, but are so unmasculine that the attitude is not harmful. Which is completely false. It implies that \textbf{sexism} ultimately is not harmful if your main characters casually partake in it. The context of the joke is not that these men are wrong in their thinking, rather that they are not masculine enough to believebly pull it off.

By that logic any time you see the stereotypical scene of a man taking his shirt off to reveal a jacked body, that too is \textbf{sexism}, right? No, it isnt.Because what overly sensitive children like yourself fail to understand, is that \textbf{nobody} is saying all penny is good for is her body, just like they don't say that about the men taking their shirts off. Ignorant kids like you have perverted the meaning of "\textbf{sexism}" and redefined it to fit your own agenda; which has basically become that if a \textbf{woman} at any point displays her sexuality in a tv show, it must somehow be \textbf{sexism} on the writers part.You're stupid.

"She slept her way to the top." The women does not have power by merit, education, sales growth and management success, and seniority in the company... she used \textbf{sex} manipulation. Sheldon points out her supposedly lowed skill employment as reference to her abilities, which traditionally known as "women's work" is actually not paid work at all but requires a great deal of skill and responsibility, raising the children who will make up the future work force. Vehicle transportation of children is a lowed paid job, transportation of any other object such as garbage are all paid substantially more. 45 U.S. Presidents, all male.

As he says he is not a hippy, or a \textbf{woman} if it looks as if another block is going to pinch the graceful and pretty often very amiable Penny he makes sure that does not happen. I have known so many manipuyative people, whatching the show whatching Sheldon helps me understand them and how they have manipulated me. I whatch every trick of Sheldons so that in future I recognise it when somone plays on one his tricks on me.   In my experience the manipulative dotn hold people together they drive them apart so this is an unrealistic bit of the program. Leonard stands up to him and at first Amie Farrow Fowler does not, the result is that he is bored by her. This may be often what bores men about girlfriends, women are too nice to their boyfriends, behave in a way with them they would not indulge in with other women.    The show is not really about good professionales, it is about those whose first interest is their friends, awful as these are.

Â I'm sorry to have to put it bluntly, but for the majority of the lifespan of the show, she's been a mess.\textbf{Sexism} is not sleeping with 30+ men, or being \textbf{dumb}, or using her breasts to further Leonard's career. Â \textbf{Sexism} is making an audience believe that the unstable girl is the one that everyone blindly desires, while the other women on the show, who are intelligent and successful come across as \textbf{crazy} and bossy.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I think that this show is extremely not-sexist. All of the examples of \textbf{sexism} that you listed are not aimed at women in general, but are character traits of one female character. And, there are two other female leads (and one supporting character) that are the opposite of Penny. It may be your opinion that those two "come across as \textbf{crazy} and bossy", but I actually prefer Bernadette and Amy to Penny because they are smart, successful, and all around better people than Penny. I'm a guy, and I would choose Bernadette over Penny in a heartbeat. And the guys on the show are not "All guys". They are nerdy, introverted guys and that is the staple of the show. That is also why they "blindly desire" Penny. Think of it this way: When everybody says "I want to be a movie-star", all they actually want is the money and fame. What they don't want is the familial dysfunction, abortions, and plastic surgeries up into their 80s just to look attractive. It's the same way with Penny. People want the looks, but they don't want the alcoholism, career failure, and stupidity.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small "\textbf{Sexism} is making an audience believe that the unstable girl is the one that everyone blindly desires, while the other women on the show, who are intelligent and successful come across as \textbf{crazy} and bossy"Seriously? That's a very stupid, idiot thing to say!! Penny IS sexy for the vast majority of people, men and women.As they appear in the show lined up Penny would be the most desirable by pretty much every group of men followed by Bernadette then Amy for very obvious reasons.Penny is tall, beautiful and is quite smart in her own way.Burnadette is very short but looking closely at her (past the never ending breast covering sweaters) she is also quite sexy (large breast and tiny waist). The fact that she has a bad temper is offputting for some men but the fact that she is supersmart and generous offsets this.Amy dresses rather unattractively and this would be a big turnoff for most men. Her being smart and quite nice looking is something that a man would have to find out having gone past the linguistic turns she has and the rather offputting manner .How are any of those some type of \textbf{sexism}? They are all based on real people I have encountered.Lets take myself as an example. I like all three women  but Penny would be my first choice and here is why.I could not deal with Bernadettes bad temper no matter how generous and smart she is.While Amy is obviously super horny and would be great in bed she just does not appeal to me as the character "Amy" although I am attracted to her reasonableness and tendency to be diplomatic.Penny would be an obvious choice in that she is quite smart, has an opinion, has the right mix of humility and go fuck yourself, is willing to accept that others my be smarter than her and is willing to learn but refuses to be bullied intellectually.And the most important of all. nice hips that look quite child bearing.Is that \textbf{sexism}?NO!! its called millions of years of evolution.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small In the program the three girl protagonists have immoral jobs. Amy experiments with monkeys and Bernadette makes drugs or helps to do so and her few commens on her job show how irresponsible about human health her and her fellow workers are in tha tfeild and we all know the bad things about drug companies while Pennies job is to sell the drugs to \textbf{doctors} and her job is reknowned for its imorality, atractives salesmen selling the most expensive prototype to \textbf{doctors} or some drug with bad side efects or tha tais in some other wise otherwise dangerous. Penny is hte only one that is really distressed by the imorality of her job, drinking more when she thinks of it and often trying to cry out of it a thing that pig Leonard wont hear of. That makes her the most together of the three women I reckon. That she is attrractive is the fault of the program. There are, in real life, a lot of attractive profesional women. indeed profesional women can spend more on clothes and on help so have more time to do themselves up than house wives do. In this programthough  the unproffesional one is the most graceful both physcal and as to social graces which are an product of intelligence. What is sexist is to look down on women unless they have a good job and often even when they do, and even more so the fact that they abuse her is sexist.     Sheldon and Leonard want ther around, even chase off competition so making it hard for her to escape them, while they continually say disparaging things to her so that she would be better off without them. She is a social advantage for them and also her company is pleasurable, she is an intelligent and witty and kind and soothing for them, a person, who they want to have around and who makes them more attractive to others but they want to have her without allowing her to feel she has any worth. They dont want to have to pay for it treating her well, sharing their glory of intelligent beings with her.     They dont only, not acknowledge her worth, acknowledging her worth would be to credit her, only sin by default, they actually knock her often, discredit her all the time and also knock any chance she has of being something that is more respected, has a higher social kudos value, would bring her up to their level, by doing all they can to make ther feel her desire to act is hopless, and so making it psychologiacally hard for her to go on instead of trying to help her get it off the ground and so to reach their level.   Optimally, as leonard pretends to love her,  he could as well as not discourageing her give her pratical. He could maybe help her to do less work in hte cheescake factory so giving her more time to work at acting. He could give her acting classes. His mother helped him to be a scientist, cold as she was she did not turn him into a \textbf{nobody}. Acting is a career that is despised by some but which needs talented people, you need to be good to do it to adquire a lot of skills to do well at it, it is not easy to be a good actor.    They like to keep the relationship as unequal as possible, they hope to enjoy her and also to increase their value at her expense, by pretending she has none and so that they shine bright at her side. They are looking for a  Tintin and Capitan Haddock type relationship but instead of just letting it be that if tha tis how things turn out, they are trying to make such a relationship happen by design, by behaving like though a bit less so, the second mate in Allen who is doing his best to knock Capitan Haddock to his knees.

I mean i think they handled the scene with them talking about the number of partners penny has had very well. there was no slut shaming. Amy asks how penny herself would categorize herself out of curiosity. No one ever implied it was wrong to sleep with that many people. Amy and bernadatte have both expressed jealousy in that regard so clearly they don't think its wrong. I also don't think them having a stupid female character makes them sexist. Does every women on film have to be intelligent now? Stupid women exist so what. Stupid men exist. the boys have often asked penny for help on things they are stupid about too. The first example yeah i'll give you that one. but i feel like the \textbf{sexism} in that one is so conspicuous in that scene that you are suppose to be laughing at the \textbf{sexism}. Not with it. It's suppose to be wrong. And it's pointing that out very loudly.

Therefore it's a simple expression of her sexuality on her part.Not to mention, even if Leonard HAD told her to use her body, she is her own person. She makes that decision. Not him.

Please, for your own safety, stop running full tilt into walls.Read this entire comment if you want to learn something for once. If not; remain delusional, fine by me.A) that's a joke at Leonard's expense, not pennys, you imbecile. Just because you dont understand a concept as basic as that doesnt make it sexist. Sorry. The joke that clearly flew over your head was that Leonard isnt a good enough scientist to beat out the likes of sheldon, or kripke, so his \textbf{woman} is there to support him. Seeing as her character is established as someone not of high intellect, she obviously cant support him in that regard, now can she? There is simply \textbf{nothing} sexist about her expressing her sexuality.Secondly, that's not sexist in the slightest. It's becoming more and more apparent that you dont actually know what \textbf{sexism} means. Like I posted above, the concept of \textbf{sexism} is D I S C R I M I N A T I N G against someone solely due to their \textbf{gender}. That's not what was done in the clip at all. Firstly, the joke isnt a reference to her \textbf{gender}, it's a reference to her attractiveness. If penny was the scientist and Leonard the arm-candy, you wouldn't call that sexist. So fuck off with your idiotic double standards. The joke isnt prioritized on her \textbf{gender}, get that through that excuse you call a brain.Thirdly, sheldon doesnt believe women are inferior to men. Nor does the show. The show has countless intelligent female presences. Just because penny isnt one isnt sexist. Amy, Bernadette, leslie winkle, that newitski girl who helped sheldon, Leonard's mother, etc. The list goes on. On top of which he CONSTANTLY references madam curie as a pioneer of science. In addition, let me remind you Zach was a character. A male, who's less intelligent than the rest of the cast (like penny), who's attractive (like penny), which serves as his form of comedic value (like penny). So if the show is "sexist" towards women because if how they occasionally portray Penny, then I guess its sexist against men too, right? No. Neither is true. Just because you're easily offended by the fact that Penny isnt a rocket scientist doesnt make it sexist. This is getting long enough, so I'll wrap this explanation up with one final point. Penny, is portrayed by Kaley Cuoco. Kaley Cuoco in real life is a devout feminist and constantly fights for equality, as well as the extinction of \textbf{sexism}. Fortunately, shes clearly much smarter than you are. If this scene, or any scene on the show for that matter was sexist in anyway, she wouldn't do it. That'd be a basic contradiction to her beliefs. And shes a huge part of the show so she definitely has the option to refuse certain scenes.I'd say hopefully this knocked some sense into you but I think you're far past that. Chances are you wont even read this entire comment, simply due to the ignorance you've already shown. Sorry to break it to you, but you simply repeating "nonono it IS sexist" and offering no explanation as to why, doesnt make you right.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Dumb, Gender, Nothing, Sexism, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}9/568 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.585 \\  \hline

Howard just sitting there and doing \textbf{nothing} while all of the ones that have manage to get a \textbf{woman} mistreat them and devalues them which is apart of \textbf{sexism} dumbass.  If your 7 year \textbf{old} niece can come up with a better argument than I can,  she most definitely puts you to shame already.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nothing, Old, Sexism, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Age - Youngsters, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}4/93 & \cellcolor{green!5}4.301 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Henry . . BTW,  I read all your comments  you're actually making things up now.  Go ahead and edit your comment so you can act like you said them all along because you didn't bring it up.  Nor did you bring up my other points.  Notice how in the v2ry beginning you just start insulting me trying to prove your point,  while also being wrong all together.  Claiming \textbf{sexism} is just discrimination when in fact even if you claimed to know the definition,  you would see that devaluing,  enforcing \textbf{gender} roles and stereotypes and general hatered for the other \textbf{sex} is apart of \textbf{sexism} not just discrimination.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Anna Jager oh anna, you've deluded your poor mind into thinking that any comment that doesn't praise women must somehow be \textbf{sexism}. What an idiotic conclusion. \textbf{Nothing} in the video above is \textbf{sexism}See, what idiots like you tend to misunderstand is that in order for something to be sexist, it must be DISCRIMINATORY against women. In no way are any of the clips above discriminating women. Like honestly, how does a clip of a \textbf{woman} simply wearing a tight dress get classified as sexist? Jesus christ you people are overly sensitive.... Its people like you who claim \textbf{sexism} or \textbf{racism} everytime they hear something they don't like or don't agree with that are the reason \textbf{sexism} and \textbf{racism} are still an issue.Grow up, kid, it's pathetic.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nothing, Racism, Sexism, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}8/128 & \cellcolor{green!5}6.25 \\  \hline
