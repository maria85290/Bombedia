  \cellcolor{green!27}\small It's the BBC. It's \textbf{old} people TV. They're very anal \& strict about what can and can't be said; especially on a morning show. She was referring to the term "Pissed Off" which Kim said at 10:28 - Victoria Derbyshire was just covering her back before the viewer complaints come flooding in. I will say though; Victoria saying "grabbing her by the \textbf{pussy}" is just as bad.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Old, pussy & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s, Nationality - Chinese & \cellcolor{green!27}2/67 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.985 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@ESClad That's what i was about to write. No apologies for "\textbf{Pussy} grab", but apologies for "pissed off or Screw this" , that's grotesquely comical .Yes the BBC used to be an honest impartial and very fair institution once upon a time . Then the BBC changed ownership and now for instance has no issue when people talk trash against muslims on a regular basis on either TV or the Radio and no apologies seem needed or expected . Strangely enough when someone says Pissed off we need an apology and if anyone ever dares mentioning anything remotely negative about Israel or Jewish people , this person is fired, banned and basically buried and forgotten . The BBC was the first to be against John Galliano , but we can say anything we want against Palestine and no apology are requested . Tony Hall, Baron of Birkenhead has become a puppet and it seems that there is a puppeteer behind the curtain . I don't like double standards . You can't only be \textbf{old} people TV when it is convenient and then censor what you believe might hurt the ears of some spectators or auditors . That for me is utterly disgusting . My long time friend Julia Sawalha told me a thing or two about the BBC and its unshakable principles .But thanks for the answer esclad. And thanks for the video , i like Kim very much , her and Joanna Lumley are the best ladies to come out of the UK.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I assure you, there are many, many more of us -We, the People - Conservative, Right-wing, Patriots who sleep well, knowing Trump is our President; and not that lying, traitorous, murdering Clinton. The only thing WE worry about, are the \textbf{lunatic} Democrats and Liberals who, literally threw their arms in the air, wailed, and "required" a "safe zone" and therapy - simply because their candidate failed. These same lunatics are still physically attacking anyone who disagrees with their demands. These outrageous lunatics destroy private citizens' personal properties - burning the innocent bystanders' cars; bashing out storefront windows; and even destroying public properties! Those of us who voted for, and continue to support, President Trump, are shocked and appalled at all the ignorant and stupid people's behavior. We did not like Obama winning twice (and for the record, I voted for that liar the first go, certainly not the second!), and yet we managed to put on our big boy/girl britches; tie-up our bootstraps; and continued to work as well as defend our country. How then is it, the wailing, abusive, destructive, uneducated nutcases are worthy of any pity? The only concern should be, "What the hell are they thinking and doing?! No Conservatives, has physically attacked these fools - but we will defend ourselves against their continued assaults because we are dyed in the wool, GOD-fearing, Family and Country-loving US Americans. Anyone who does not respect or agree with our Constitution and Bill of Rights, is free to leave and move to a country whose government and ideologies suits their wants, needs, and expectations. Buh-bye. Oh, and by the way, Hillary is not Presidential material. She lacked the dignity, grace, and LORD knows she lacks integrity - so much so (poor loser), she refused to face her supporters, thank them for their efforts, and congratulate Trump publicly - to show support for THE President Trump...as did when she lost to Obama.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small It is ironic that Kim Cattrall was more established as an actress than SJP when they all began \textbf{Sex} In The City.  When the regular producer of the show left, the next producer in the show was a good friend of SJP.  Hence Kim Cattrall, was NEVER given an executive producer position , which she had longed for, to write and direct future episodes, it was given to SJP.  Also, during the same time that the cast of "Friends", agreed to ALL jointly get paid the same salary, \$1,000,000 per episode, "\textbf{Sex} In the City" paid SJP \$1,000,000 plus Producer Fees per episode,  whilst the rest of the cast \$350,000 - \$250,000 per episode.  SJP would also socialize with the rest of the cast, rent beach homes or houses on location out of the country for the other women of SITC, while excluding Kim Cattrall; Kim said that SJP yielded power over every aspect of the script, and shooting schedule, it was a total "Mean Girl" set for the entire duration the show was on the air.  As an older actress, the deal to agree to a \$1,000,000 per episode pay scale as the "Friends"  cast had contracted jointly, would have made an immense difference in Kim's life now, as \textbf{ageism} makes it difficult to procure roles.  SJP knows what she did here.  Kim is not a phoney,  SJP is.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Ageism, Sex & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/230 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.304 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Why is this whole interview about some social justice/feminism bullshit?  I'm bored of it now.  It's in every single interview of a Hollywood star.  Also, I'm glad Hilary Clinton isn't in the White House.  She's just as ruthless and cutthroat as any man out there.  Why are people terrified of Trump as President?  I voted for him and am still happy that I made my choice.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I enjoy, and have always enjoyed watching and listening to Kim Catrall. She is an interesting and animated human being. I´d watch a film just because I like her personality so much. Why all this talk about \textbf{age} and looks? Boring. Life has so much to offer, and it is clear to everyone that the whole world does not enjoy watching young women.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small If people do fear Trump as a president, it is not because of who he is and what good he can do, but because of media who created a spectacle, a monster out of him. It is too outrageous to say that one man is the reason of whole nations fears. If we to pick all the thoughts and words that ever were thought and told from those supposedly "moral" "good" people, we would find more degrading examples i believe than "grab a \textbf{pussy}".

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Trump is a monster, and on top of that, he's a senile, demented monster.

Some say it was his tactics to becoming a president and some see it is the truth. And i think it is truth because only a passionate and trully patriotic person can withstand the bullshit that is  being poured everyday on him, not even one president before him had to handle that much of a heat.   That is my opinion today. I am an open-minded person and open for a debate. Anyway morality of today is so hypocritical, as it was always i suppose.

Funnier thing , the show she's promoting stayed On till the end thanks to New York's audience , America , New York , America where according to her "people don't go naturally to the theater as they do in Europe" Hone : tell Europe to pay you back for your failure there ..

It's like an insult to your intelligence. The sickest thing is, it's not just acting either in the Anglosphere that is \textbf{ageist} - even knowledge jobs like IT go to kids instead of people with decades of experience, all the time.
