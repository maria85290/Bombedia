All I hear is anti-semitism here, anti-semitism there, but NO news agency could declare any reliable information. I am working on a scientific paper regarding this subject, if this party is systematically anti-semitic  and over a week of research, I could NOT pin one thing on the claims made. And what on earth has it to do with Corbyn? Where is the link between Corbyn and the anti-semitism of his party members? Where is the why? Why did it start after his election and not before? Please answer me that because for 8:43 minutes you have not made one valid point against this party, just throwing assumptions.

What a revelation.  Thank goodness the BBC has opened the public eye.  Jewish people are hiding in cellars and avoiding going out at night, especially in places where Labour Party fascists congregate.  Many Jewish people are planning escape routes and some have bought inflatable rubber life boats to flee by sea if necessary.  The Labour Party crystal night is only a few months away, and the BBC warning to the public may be too late.

If you read the play strongly you can see \textbf{Shylock} has always been put down and the winners at the end seem pampered and self-righteous. Also he has the best imagination in the play.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The BBC is just a mouthpiece for Zionism. They have spun it that anyone who criticizes the Israeli regime is Anti Semitic which is completely ludicrous. Zionism is a political ideology and there fore it must be open to criticism. Unfortunately the people who control Israel also control the US and the UK . Zionist hide behind the Jewish faith so they can bring out the poor me Card. They pretend they was set up to protect the Jewish people when the fact is they was not. Orthodox Jews are just as much victims as the rest of us. Jews are not to blame for the problems in the world. Unfortunately the Zionists use real Jewish people as a human shield to take the blame for all of the wrongs  they are committing. The Zionist have 80 of the UK Lobby so it is no surprise we are drip fed all this anti Semitic garbage. The BBC Are \textbf{nothing} but criminals and no matter how much they try to re-write history, people around the world are waking up to the fact that they are a Zionist institution. Stop being fooled by all the Main stream media. They are bought and paid for just like our Politicians. They are all owned by the Banksters who owned everything else. Do your research. This is not a con theory, this is factual information. Wake up. Even the term Conspiracy theory was created back in the 60s by the CIA after they murdered there own President. This term was to be used to call anyone who questioned the official story, and anyone who asked questions, to make them seem \textbf{crazy} and for the most part the people fell for it.

It did not have actual policies against against \textbf{black} people, but it simply did not take them seriously as either victims or witnesses. In Labour there has been a shift in the membership and the power base to a more left wing group that has a particular focus on (some might obsession with) the Israel and Palestine issue. It has a particular dislike of zionists and most Jewish people (the vast majority) would subscribe to the right to a Jewish homeland, even if many are disturbed by activities in the occupied territories. Due to this group's influence on the party's levers of power, comments and attitudes that would once have been challenged had been allowed to fester. Looking through the comments section here, I see plenty of evidence of anti-semitism. Lots of tropes, especially around Jewish control and influence in evidence. While I don't know that those spreading them are members, they are all of an agreement that the Labour Party does not have a problem and that Israel is a Bad Thing.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/222 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.901 \\  \hline

I think it's because they(mainstream media companies)are powerful corporations who are comfortable paying less tax and maintaining the neo liberal status quo and Labour is going to change this along with many other aspects of the economy and society so naturally they will hurl anything at Corbyn to stop him. Antisemitism seems to be working effectively for them but before this they tried to paint him as a Czech spy, a \textbf{terrorist} sympathizer, and most recently, they have tried to say he is too frail. They attack him because he can't be bought and sold like most politicians, so whilst I hope he will keep doing all he can to overcome the antisemitism issue, I commend him for fighting on for those who desperately need a Labour government in spite of all the flack and personal character attacks he has to endure.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nothing, Terrorist & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Religious Identity - Muslim & \cellcolor{green!27}2/205 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.976 \\  \hline

I actually think they made a good decision in not taking part; with limited material, John Ware (who has already caused problems for the BBC before in a libel case they were forced to pay out on!) managed to carve out an extremely one sided narrative. He had no intention or interest of making a balanced programme, so with more material he would have just done the same thing, but probably slightly more convincingly. I implore you to check him out, his previous programmes show how he likes to spin a story.I found it hard to swallow that the ex-employees would outright lie, but they had been accused way before this was made, the same clique of people, of purposefully using their position of power on the disciplinary board to try to purge members supporting corbyn in the leadership \textbf{race}. Given the huge amount of resistance to Corbyn within the party, this is entirely plausible to me. When you then take that in context of this programme, clearly a propaganda piece about the man, using every opportunity to regurgitate footage of him sharing stages with controversial people, using dramatic music ffs.....it makes MORE sense, not less.Have you seen The Lobby, the documentary by Aljazeera? Apart from standing as an amazing piece of investigative journalism of its own right, one really key thing from that applies here: the definition of "Anti-Semitism". In that documentary, Joan Ryan showcases exactly what I suspect an awful lot of the "Anti-Semitism" being reported within the labour party constitutes: lies. She heard what she wanted to hear, she certainly filed a report on what she wanted to hear, and it's only because it was caught on camera that she had to leave and the "anti-Semitic" \textbf{woman} whose comment caused distress, was let off. Quite rightly; you can see soooo clearly in that documentary the \textbf{woman} is \textbf{nothing} of a \textbf{racist} or anti-Semite, and the false claims made there are exactly what is being reported here (IMO) and exactly what is a danger to all minorities: the purposeful wrong use of labels for political gain, meaning true \textbf{racism} is delegitimised. You seem like a person willing to respond and hopefully investigate! Please check out "the Lobby," if you haven't seen it, particularly that scene should be a real eye opener to anyone jumping on the "labour is anti Semitic, full stop" train - we're going down a very slippery \textbf{slope}. Also, take time to read up on that email which mr Ware decided to just change at his whim (I actually hope it ends in another libel case against him, maybe he'll stop being given airtime), and the man himself - he's made some good propaganda before. A shame because in his early career, he did some good investigative journalism!

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small There seems to be little new here and much that is open to accusations of hearsay.For this to be an objective piece, plausibly making the case that Labour is 'institutionally' anti-Semitic, the documentary should reference more actual cases, delve into these in detail, and prove these have been mishandled. The few cases that are cited are not thoroughly discussed and are often anecdotal (with insufficient detail and no right-to-reply). The Jackie Walker case is a good example - we have a young investigator relating the charges second-hand. Why not be explicit about what Jackie Walker actually said and then interrogate the way the complaint was handled?Also, some cases appear to have been resolved - Kaylor Bibi has actually been suspended. Other instances are admitted - Corbyn has apologised for the mural, says he did not know about Raed Salah, etc.In short, much of the doccie is \textbf{old} news.Also, there are many general statements, but \textbf{nothing} statistical, regarding the proportion of proven complaints to membership figures. Labour cites anti-Semitism as constituting 0.06 of membership. That's low.To make the 'institutional' claim stick, this needs to be disproved.As to interference, the allegation is immediately undercut by what appears to be the serious misquoting of a key email by Seumas Milne.  [LINK] This is so glaring that it invites suspicion.Much of the rest is guilt-by-association, or by referencing a 'pattern' rather than specific cases.More generally, it's important to remember that any disputes process cannot stand outside of UK \textbf{Common} Law.People are entitled to a presumption of innocence, and to a fair hearing, before being excluded or sanctioned. Anti-Semitism is notoriously hard to prove, precisely because what is, or is not, an anti-Semitic trope, and whether the person using that trope is doing so knowingly (in which case expulsion might be justified) or ignorantly, merely believing they are criticising Israel or Zionism (in which case a warning might be more appropriate) can be genuinely hard to determine.Look at Naz Shah's 2014 Facebook post (one of the original anti-Semitism cases) which satirically suggested Israel might be moved to the US. That post could easily be read as a political commentary about Israel, rather than a \textbf{racist} comment about Jews, who live in many different countries.Ditto with Livingston's take on Zionism in \textbf{Nazi} Germany. He might be wrong about the history (although he seems to have a point) but this does not make him anti-Semitic, merely wrong.In short, it's not that straightforward. This ambiguity alone might explain why complaints take so long to deal with, and why a backlog might require extra capacity.Also, freedom of speech is worth caring about. There can be little doubt, following Al Jazeera's The Lobby (featuring hidden cameras rather than John Ware's studied appearance of objectivity) that the Israeli state is making active attempts to undermine the international BDS movement, and actively promoting this agenda through surrogate groups in the UK and US.An Israeli diplomat was removed from the London embassy when this was exposed.In short, one has to be very careful with every complaint and ask where the accusation is emanating from. A little fine-grained analysis in this regard would have supported Panorama's claim to making a even-handed investigation, but it is lacking.Finally, much of the discussion here is around the meta-narrative - iow, what has Labour done ABOUT anti-Semitism. To make the charge stick that Labour is 'institutionally' anti-Semitic, the film-maker needs to examine the actual narratives that are at the heart of the claim.Unfortunately, by not doing so, he has left himself open to accusations of bias - at best, fanning the flames of a moral panic; at worst, acting as an ideologue and propagandist for his class- and political commitments.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Common, Nazi, Nothing, Old, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Age - Over 65s, Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}5/629 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.795 \\  \hline

There was not that long ago  another "liberal democracy" who also believed that THEIR "chosen people " status allowed them to commit the vilest of crimes, and that anyone who criticised the acts of what they called "self preservation" was just a "\textbf{commie}" and a traitor to the natural order of evolution.

Not only are you going to build upon an unproven narrative which has been built in a completely unbalanced way by the media, you are going to accuse Corbyn of effectively being someone who is deliberately and connivingly creating and peddling prejudiced conspiracy theories about Jews. Take the Chris Williamson debacle. He said labour were 'too apologetic about antisemitism'; this was deliberately misconstrued and misrepresented  by the media to mean that Labour should not apologise for anti-Semitism. However, that is not what he meant and was not all he ultimately said; he explicitly stated what he meant at the time. Williamson's point was that by being 'too apologetic', labour were inadvertently overstating the seriousness of antisemitism in their party, when in fact the Labour party members are less \textbf{racist} towards any group than most. Clearly, this is not antisemitic but it was portrayed that way. The focus about the issue of antisemitism has purely been on Labour. Their has been no statistical analysis of other groups to compare attitudes between them and Labour party members; the media has just built upon a predetermined belief. There are purely ideological motives to get rid of Corbyn because he does not fit in with the neoliberal system which dominates modern society in the UK.

In this case, that looks like the confusion of \textbf{race} and politics: part of the problem is that both the pro Palestinan camp and the pro Israeli camp of the Arab/Israeli conflict have been politicising \textbf{race}. The beligerents of the conflict themselves are blurring the lines: e.g. the Palestinian right associaties occupation with "Zionism" and associate Israel with all Jewish peoples. The Israeli right does the same and claims that any criticism of Israeli occupation is a politically motivated denial of the Jewish people's right to self determine and is rooted in anti semetism.  Labour has long been a supporter of the Palestinian side of the conflict. This has dulled the ability of many of its members to see the political conflict objectively, and it looks like many in the party's base has begun to take on the view of the Palestinian right.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Race, Racism & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}4/165 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.424 \\  \hline

The singular difference in this case is that the invader is Israel, and Israel is the only Jewish state, and the history of persecution of its people has the sympathy of the world. But this sympathy and the heightened sensitivity that surrounds this history is open to abuse. It is my view, and the view of many others, none of whom you could ever call \textbf{racist} or anti-Semitic, that this abuse is happening and that any moral high ground that the Jewish people of Israel may have been granted by virtue of their regrettable historical persecution has been lost as a consequence of their own bullish actions. That many Jews around the world support the Israeli regime is a political choice. I do not agree with that choice and I will argue against it. If you by consequence categorise me as therefore anti-Semitic I will cite your illogic as a perfect example of a false syllogism. Basically, you are wrong. Dead wrong. Fucking dead wrong, right?

Israeli cruelty to the Palestinian people is widespread and well known in both countries. Hamas isn't even supported by the majority of Palestinians despite their suffering - 76 of Palestinians want a peaceful solution and Hamas to go away. Israel has no interest in a peaceful solution and is little more than an apartheid state that is trying to steal land from people who lived there for thousands of years before they got there. Its disgusting. The fact Israel is so powerful on the world stage means Palestine has no voice because of them in many areas and those who support Palestine tend to either be quiet about it or overly cautious about links with Israel (I think Corbyn is the latter fwiw).

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small British Jews are furious the Labour party refused to accept the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism and adopted its own instead. The refusal has pushed Labour to the brink of a civil war with its Jewish parliamentarians and members.But what is the difference? And how did it take us to the point where Jeremy Corbyn was branded 'antisemitic and a \textbf{racist}' to his faceby one of his own MPs?The IHRA definitionA total of 31 countries have adopted the IHRA definition of antisemitism, as well as more than 130 UK local councils, the police, the Crown Prosecution Service and the judiciary. Eight of the 31 countries have enshrined it in law. The definition was an offshoot of one created in 2005 by the European Union's Monitoring Centre for \textbf{Racism} and \textbf{Xenophobia}, then the EU's leading anti-\textbf{racism} body. When EU directives changed the role of the agency, it no longer promoted the definition, and the IHRA stepped into the breach.What Labour left out when it chose its own versionThe IHRA definition specifies eleven 'contemporary examples of antisemitism', while making it clear that there may be others.These are:1. Calling for, aiding, or justifying the killing or harming of Jews in the name of a radical ideology or an extremist view of religion.2. Making mendacious, dehumanising, demonising, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as such or the power of Jews as collective — such as, especially but not exclusively, the myth about a world Jewish conspiracy or of Jews controlling the media, economy, government or other societal institutions.3. Accusing Jews as a people of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jewish person or group, or even for acts committed by non-Jews.4. Denying the fact, scope, mechanisms (e.g. gas chambers) or intentionality of the genocide of the Jewish people at the hands of National Socialist Germany and its supporters and accomplices during World War II (the Holocaust).5. Accusing the Jews as a people, or Israel as a state, of inventing or exaggerating the Holocaust.6. Accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel, or to the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the interests of their own nations.7. Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a \textbf{racist} endeavor.8. Applying double standards by requiring of it a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic \textbf{nation}.9. Using the symbols and images associated with classic antisemitism (e.g., claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel) to characterise Israel or Israelis.10. Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis.11. Holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nation, Racism, Racist, Xenophobia & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}4/464 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.862 \\  \hline
