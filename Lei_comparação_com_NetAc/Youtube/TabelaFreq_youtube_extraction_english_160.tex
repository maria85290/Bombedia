  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Many people abuse in several time or everytime. The unlawful to harass a person because of his or her \textbf{age}.  Unlawful \textbf{age} discrimination happens when someone is treated unfavourably because of their \textbf{age}, without justification, or is harassed or victimised because of their \textbf{age}. We can include fighting younger \textbf{age} than them, bullying, punishing, and hardtalk.If your child cadger a bread will you give him or her a punch? Harassment includes behaviour that is offensive, frightening or in any way distressing. It may be intentional bullying which is obvious or violent, but can also be unintentional, subtle and insidious.No culture was exempt from the problem, and no culture can claim to be exempt today. While we've made dishearteningly little progress, at least we've started taking a relatively clear-eyed look at the groups that are affected and the situations in which discrimination occurs. At least we're willing to acknowledge discrimination as a problem, although we can't even be trusted to get that right much of the time.But do you believe that  every life is valuable?This \textbf{age} discrimination can cause a war and can cause of death.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!27}6/189 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.175 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small i actually broke my mouse (not kidding, seriously) when i saw this. 1:00 Kids are not stupid because of \textbf{age}.They dont mimic stuff because of \textbf{age}. im probably smarter than a lot of you adults, and have better grammar. kids act like that because they get mad when they say "Hey guys i think i saw something over there!" and they are then ignored. We Go to this behavior because YOU disrespect US. We also deserve the right of speech. we need all the rights in the constitution, freedom for ALL. it also made me mad when i went to staples to get a new mouse, and told my mom to stay in the car. that i could handle it. then at the cashier the \textbf{woman} said "sorry honey, you need a adult with you. your too young." i don't think that was in the store policy. what was that? it was her being \textbf{ageist}. i should have been \textbf{racist} to her, but i wasn't. couse' i was the lil' nice kid. Martin Luther king and \textbf{Abe} Lincoln freed \textbf{colored} people. Cezar Chaves helped the latins. I want to be the next in the list to free young and experienced people, they don't have rights. Experienced people have to go to homes, and kids are forced to take some subjects at school they don't want to. i could list other stuff, but im just going to put etc. someone help put a stop to this.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Abe, Age, Ageist, Colored, Racist, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General, Religious Identity - Jewish & \cellcolor{green!5}7/245 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.857 \\  \hline

\textbf{\Large Result analysis:}

\begin{itemize}\item Taking into account the words that were detected, we can reach the conclusion these comments are associated with : : Age - General;Age - Over 65s;Ethnicity - General;Gender - General;Ethnicity - Black;Religious Identity - Jewish;%.

\item The percentage of hate speech related words is 2.2584.

\item Considering that the variable \textbf{Age - General} has the most occurences in the post, we can interpret that this is the predominant hate speech.

\item Overall there were 28/19 occurences of hate speech related comments.\end{itemize}\end{document}
