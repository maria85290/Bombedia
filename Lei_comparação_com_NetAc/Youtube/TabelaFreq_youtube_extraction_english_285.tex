\hline\cellcolor{green!27}\small Remember when I mentioned that Mayer Amschel Rothschild was mentioned in The Jewish Encyclopedia, Vol. 10, published in 1906, pp. 490, in that he was an agent of Prince William Landgrave IX of Hesse Cassel (sometimes spelled as Kassel) who funded British Troops against The American Revolution?Well, it was mentioned in The Journals of The House of Commons published in 1803 by The Parliament of Great Britain that Prince William Landgrave IX of Hesse Kassel out of Germany married Princess Mary, the daughter of King George II from Great Britain.History \textbf{Dot} Com also has an article titled, "How Queen Victoria's Matchmaking Helped Cause World War I" where they mention The Royal Marriage Act of 1772 which led to Queen Victoria's 9 children's 42 grandchildren - and I quote: "Eventually, seven of them sat on European thrones in Russia, Greece, Romania, Britain, Germany, Spain and Norwayâ€”and all would take sides during World War I with disastrous consequences."Of course, President Jimmy Carter wrote about Baron Lionel Walter Rothschild who signed The Balfour Declaration of November, 1917 which led to the re-establishment of Israel in 1948 through his book, "Palestine - Peace Not Apartheid." Forbes also reported that Trump's right hand man, Wilbur Ross, worked for The Rothschild Bankers as a chairman for them out of New York. The NY Times reported that Baroness Lynn Forester de Rothschild funded Hillary Clinton and Sen. John McCain's Campaign. Of course, the first person I thought of when I heard Baron in front of their names was "The \textbf{R\textbf{ed}} Baron" from WWI. Funny that people don't question where they come from.The Rothschild Banking Barons worked their unwelcomed way back into The United States through August Belmont. They even mention August Belmont on The Rothschild Foundation's Website. I also read through a book from the 1800s that August Belmont promoted Salmon P. Chase who was behind our National Banking Act of 1883. There was also a book stating that Salmon P. Chase became upset over the accusations made against Simon Wolf, \textbf{Abe} Lincoln's Jewish Attorney, who was threatened with arrest by a U.S. Col. Baker from The U.S. War Department for trading with Southern Jews during The Civil War. The Jewish Historical Society of Greater Washington's website reported on Simon Wolf and Col. Baker. Simon Wolf was a spokesman for B'nai B'rith formed in October of 1843 and a member of The Congregation of Hebrews. You can also find books from the 1800s on Simon Wolf who became impressed by The Rothschild's mansions and castles. Don Thomas wrote a book titled, "The Reason Lincoln Had to Die" with a picture of Salmon P. Chase on the cover of his book that you might want to look into. Also, George Peabody did receive huge loans from British Bankers after The Civil War ended before working with Julius Spencer Morgan to form J.P. Morgan \& Company. Of course, people tend to forget about things like The Battle of Quebec in 1759 and The Treaty of Paris in 1763-1783 when The British controlled Upper Canada. Of course, The British burned down The White House in The War of 1812, and there are other things like The Aroostook War in Aroostook County, Maine 1838-9 which was a border skirmish between The British and The United States on where the border line was to be divided. Also, I haven't seen U.S. Mainstream Media Stations report on Quebec's Sovereignty Movement which formed in the late 1960s through Parti Quebecois and Bloc Quebecois. Mouvement-Quebec, off their website, basically calls Canada's Constitution a "Myth." They claim that The French weren't included in the talks when Canada's Confederation was signed in Charlotteton, P.E.I. in 1867 due to The Treaty of Paris. Of course, even The Canadian Encyclopedia reported that Prince Edward Island didn't even sign Canada's Confederation until 1873. Of course, if it weren't for The French supplying arms to Separatists during The American Revolution, our U.S. Founding Fathers would have never won The American Revolution. If you look into the list of battles between The British and France, you'll find many battles before The Napoleon Wars. That all ended 12 years after The Battle of Waterloo at The Battle of Navarino when France became an ally of The British, or was that due to Mayer Amschel Rothschild's sons, Nathaniel Rothschild and James Rothschild, as depicted in that 20th Century Fox movie from 1934 called, "The House of Rothschild?" Even through The Encyclopedia Britannica, The Canadian Monarchy is known as The British Monarchy. The Bank of Canada is a Crown Corporation controlled by The Crown of Canada. Rent Subsidies from Crown Land in Canada still goes to The Crown of Canada. The Queen's Bench and Queen's Court are still called the same today as it was called in the past. Canada still has a "Privy Council" just like Great Britain. Ireland got rid of their Privy Council in 1933 due to The British meddling into their political affairs. What if Canada is a puppet government? What if The British Royals and Rothschilds created a puppet government here in The United States? Perhaps, G. Edward Griffin's book, "The Creature From Jekyll Island" is correct. Of course, in May of 1707, England joined Scotland to form Great Britain. Great Britain in 1801 joined Northern Ireland to form The United Kingdom. The United Kingdom joined Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, and Sweden to form The European Union. Besides, who would have the power to censor Baroness Tonge in European Parliament in 2009 over Israel's War Crimes against Palestinians, and that video can be found on YouTube.Think about all that for a few hours especially since Archive Org has an article on President Andrew Jackson standing against The Rothschild Bankers after Jackson took over President John Quincy Adam's Anti-Mason Party formed in the early 1800s. The Anti Mason Party was formed after the murder of Capt. William Morgan at Lake Ontario after he wrote the book, "Illustrations of Freemasonry." There is a video on YouTube of Capt. William Morgan's Memorial. Also, Reddit shared an video/article of a hippie presenting a Canadian Constitutional Lawyer who tried to bring The Rothschild \& Sons Company along with The Queen of England to court in 2012. Funny that CBS's Show, Supergirl, downplayed Reddit as a reliable source when Supergirl became a reporter for Catco in their show especially when mainstream media shared Reddit as a source many times in the past. Also, Former U.S. Congressman Paul Findley stated on television that Jews control U.S. Congress. Rep. Traficant also stated that he wasn't given a chance to defend himself over the accusations made against him before they sentenced him to prison for several years. The only one to complain about the lack of defense granted to U.S. Congressman James Traficant was U.S. Congressman Ron Paul in U.S. Congress. Also, I have to wonder if Lord Blackheath was leaving a 'hint' when he mentioned Lord Sassoon in The House of Lords while mentioning a foundation he called, "Foundation X" that lent \$15 Trillion to The HSBC Bank. People do call Lord Sassoon, "The Rothschild of The East." It was also mentioned on The Chinese Embassy's website that Lord Sassoon along with Baron Jacob Rothschild met with The H.E. Chinese Ambassador at The Chinese Embassy before Lord Blackheath made what people called, "his odd statement" in The House of Lords. Not sure if that is why people call him The Rothschild of The East of if it is due to Lord Sassoon who is or was chairman of The British Chinese Business Council. I also find it interesting that The NY Times mentioned The HSBC Bank in their articles titled, "Too Big To Jail Banks." Of course, The NY Times, in 1988, also reported that President George Bush is a descendant of The British Royals, and ancestry websites reported the same. Of course, President John Quincy Adams was also a descendant of The British Royals, but I like President John Quincy Adams more than I like President Bush. Adams was my favorite President. At least he fought for our freedom and equality from entitlements from a Crown.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Abe, Dot, Red & \cellcolor{green!27} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Ethnicity - Asian (South- India, Pakistan, Bangladesh), Ethnicity - Native-American, Religious Identity - Jewish & \cellcolor{green!27}4/1379 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.29 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Let's imagine that visitors from outer space arrive one day soon, intelligent enough to have developed the necessary technology but ignorant of the history of our planet. They quickly learn English and read in the news about antisemitism. Their research informs them that since the beginning of recorded history a small minority have encountered problems with almost all other groups with which they have come into contact, so that often they have been treated brutally and even expelled from host nations to which they migrated. So harsh was their treatment in the last century that now every effort is made to protect them from attacks and criticism, going as far as making it illegal to say things that were in \textbf{common} usage for millennia. Still the mistreatment continues. The outsiders apply their logical minds to the problem and suggest that the root cause might lie in the behavior of this minority.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Common & \cellcolor{green!5}Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}1/151 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.662 \\  \hline
