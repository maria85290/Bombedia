That is where the real money is made and where the danger becomes very real for the women. And the Boss Lady does not disclose these parts of the danger and the ugly underbelly of stripping.

So she took to stripping for awhile and were as what able to buy her own her house and what have a nice nest egg for herself, and had enough to also buy a nice there car, in like a few years. It paid off for her. She were pulling down on average probably 400 a night; and this as was like 20 years ago or so, some nights making up to almost a thousand. It were like \textbf{crazy} money; and this was oh her as being someone that were not a total slut about it. What you got in Scotland or the UK is totally like oh slavery man. Girls in the USA would never let that be. It has been probably twenty years since I were last in a strip club and what. So I agree; freaking robbery what UK girls get paid. They obviously have not known any better money than that. In the USA you are making a 100 pounds worth of cash in the first 2 hours on a decent night in an decent enough busy area.  And you can barter your own hourly individual rate. So if you think that you are worth oh 20 pounds a dance then there is your price. The owner establishes \textbf{nothing} of what how much girls get to charge. The girls just as lease the club space and use it like their own independent work space, with of course following certain law guidelines and what.
