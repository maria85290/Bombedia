  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The laws in place protecting people from \textbf{age} discrimination are very clear and are constructed in such a way that makes it near impossible to prosecute perpetrators successfully. The recognizable signs of the acts of \textbf{age} discrimination, both overt and covert, are so well known, and hence avoided by the perpetrators, that the possibility of any legal success in prosecution of the offense is impossible. The usual offenders can either afford to employ a legal department or keep legal counsel on retainer to protect their interests...individuals typically cannot afford this luxury. Employers use instructional videos that all employees are required to view, that address these laws, so employers can 'wash their hands' of any liability, while they themselves practice the abuse of \textbf{age} discrimination without repercussion. There are several reasons why the success rate of offender prosecution is negligible. States that are in the 'Right to Work' category, enjoy bathing in the ability to execute an \textbf{age}-based termination without ethical justification or having to prove why. This burden falls on the victim who can nether prove, much less afford to prove the act of discrimination. The EEOC who is in place to provide protections in this area has proven to be useless in its management of \textbf{age} discrimination claims and does little to \textbf{nothing} to help the victims. There is also no money to be made in the attempt to prove \textbf{age} discrimination, so victims are further victimized by a system designed to protect the perpetrator‚Ä¶not the abused. Employers are 'encouraged' by health organizations to 'find ways' to keep costs low and in so doing \textbf{age} discrimination is employed through the use of higher premiums and/or termination of the older worker. This results in what we currently have today, which are useless laws that are used to identify 'what' are considered valid examples of \textbf{age} discrimination, as defined by current law, used by legal counsel to 'coach' the perpetrators avoidance rather than ethical governance of a fair, just, and non-discriminatory work environment. IF these laws worked, we would see an equitable distribution of ages represented in the workplace, but that is not the case. While there may be a few instances, they are far and few between and few employers demonstrate that equitable \textbf{age} distribution is being practiced in the workplace today. We all suffer from \textbf{age}-based discrimination‚Ä¶some of us sooner than others but one day it will happen to all of us who are lucky(?) enough to last that long.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!27}9/411 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.19 \\  \hline
