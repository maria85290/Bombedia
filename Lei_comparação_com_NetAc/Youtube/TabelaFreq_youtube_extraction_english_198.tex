  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The lady doth protest too much! In raising these false and inaccurate claims and complaints SHE is being sexist and \textbf{ageist}!

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Whoopi needs to stick to comedy \& acting. She's become the rich elitist she used to protest against. \textbf{Fat} \textbf{o\textbf{ld} h\textbf{ag}} - is that sexist \& \textbf{ageist} enough for you, Whoopi?\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Ageist, Fat, Hag, Old, Old hag & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Gender - Female age and physical appearance, Physical Identity - Physical Features & \cellcolor{green!5}5/31 & \cellcolor{green!5}16.129 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I used to like Whoopi, that was a long time ago when she was only the actress.Now, when rich \& famous... not so much. She became a bully, detached from the reality of \textbf{black} ppl living in America. Like she forgets, where she would've been (in life) if not for the Hollywood fame. Don't like her outlook, she sides w/riches and turns a \textbf{blind} eye on corruption, injustice, discrimination and poverty. On top of that her demeanor is aggressive, bully-like. F**k her.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Blind & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}2/83 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.41 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Nancy Pelosi isn't being rejected because of her \textbf{age} or her \textbf{gender}.. she's being objective to and rejected because of her crappy neo liberal policies positions. which lead the Democratic party to defeat over and over.. stop with the false claims Whoopie..\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Gender & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/42 & \cellcolor{green!27}4.762 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small So people don't know Whoopi is literally mentally \textbf{handicapped}? People should have woken up to her BS when she defends her ex BF and herself doing blackface for "comedy" and fun few years ago, but now calls everyone \textbf{racist} she don't like politically.  Or when she literally defended a convicted pedophile in Director Roman Polanksi, because he is part of her Hollywood liberal elites, but criticizes Kavanaugh or Trump every other sentence. She is literally an idiot.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Handicapped, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}2/77 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.597 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small And I'm so \textbf{ageist}, sexist, and \textbf{racist} that I too will vote for Bernie, also voted for Jill, and want Nina Turner for Bernie's VP in 2020 and POTUS in 2024.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Ageist, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/31 & \cellcolor{green!5}6.452 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@commentor Yes, I see some people squealing over the idea of Richard Ojeda debating Trump onstage, but can you imagine Nina Turner debating Trump? That'd be a whole different ball game. I just wish she had more name recognition to do a 2020 run. I kinda think that's necessary when up against Trump's universal recognition.Too bad she didn't win her last \textbf{race} for office, but neither did Ojeda. I can't see why anyone would be more excited over Ojeda, a total newbie, than Nina Turner - except thst he's white, male, and a Marine.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Race & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/95 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.053 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@epockismet Speak for yourself! I'm Whoopi's \textbf{age} and take "\textbf{zero} credit" for the shit you talk about! Furthermore, I'm FROM LA!!! I have worked my entire life FOR others----young, old----doesn't matter to me. I speak 4+ languages fluently, have a doc in psych. What have YOU done in your very short life? I am CURRENTLY living (retired) on the border STRUGGLING to help others who are very important to me!! WTF are you doing?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I don't object to Nancy because she's \textbf{old}, I object to her, among other reasons, because she's senile. " Let's hear it for more pre-existing medical conditions! "  "Yay!"  The senile leading the stupid. If she ever steps foot in our district we aren't aware of it. She doesn't even say she's a San Franciscan anymore. The ACA money came with strings that are unraveling our relatively excellent public health system.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The truly sad thing is that for the past forty years, the democrats were the less \textbf{racist} party. That lead to everyone voting for the lesser evil supposedly. By the smallest margin.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/32 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.125 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small "Whoopi you're dreds are wrapped too tight". Ha! Great Commentary, Niko.  Nancy Pelosi has been rubber-stamping the \$6 Trillion dollar immoral "War on Terror" for 2 Decades now.  Whoopi is a \textbf{ABC} post 9/11-Coup Government CIA Project Mockingbird Stooge. We did used to call them "Sell-Outs", back in the day. Just another Rich member of  the Olde School Establishment. The \textbf{Black} Womyn Bill Maher.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small You are far to respectful to Whoopi.  She lost all credibility with this incoherent rant.  I wonder who payed her to whore herself out like that?  \textbf{ABC}?
