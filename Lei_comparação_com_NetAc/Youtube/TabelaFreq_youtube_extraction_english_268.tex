"Israel recognizes itself as a Jewish State but claims to be Democratic is wrong" Bruh.Firstly, there is \textbf{nothing} wrong with is being called the Jewish State, because A, Israel is a JEWISH Foundation, and B, Biblically, JUDAH is the son of ISRAEL. Second. Just because Israel is called the Jewish State doesn't mean it's not Democratic. ALL are welcome ONLY if they respect they're fellow Israeli, abide the rules, no hate, etc. Lastly. Don't say that Arab's rights are violated in Israel, they're not. Israel is one of the few (non fascist) State in the entire region that GUARENTEES these rights! If a Jew would walk down the streets of Ramallah (stab). But Israel allows Arabs the same rights, liberties, and opportunities, and not to mention the Joint Arab, Pro PLO party, in the Knesset (Parliament).\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!27}1/142 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.704 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small These people are so dedicated to racial equality that they are willing to me anti amreican.   All issues no matter what the are must be subserviant to american instersts.  If people of color become anti american.  Then americans must not support every sigle issue that people of color support.  This is not an automatic thing.  If someithing is called racisit.  That is called "\textbf{racist}" that does not automatically mean that  people should be against it.

In this world people of color run nations that I would not want to live in.  So don't support those nations just because people of color run them.  This is the trunt, there is NO \textbf{nation} run by people of \textbf{African} decent that funtions well.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The 3.8 billion dollars that the USA claims to give to Israel every year, is actually interest owed to the zionist bankers, for all of the money that they have "predatorily" loaned us over the years, beginning in 1791, the same year that our Bill Of Rights was signed. The Rothschilds were there, with their greedy hands out-stretched, for repayment for loans that were used to win the Revolutionary war. Criticizing zionist bankers, or their comrades, AIPAC, is certainly not anti-semetic, because the Israeli citizens, in Israel, are under the same financial thumb that the USA is. AIPAC, and 86 congressional members, who are dual citizens with Israel, are watch dogs for the federal, \textbf{nazi} zionists, to make sure that the bankers get every penny that they can from their American slaves, including jews who are not zionists. Every zionist is not a jew, such as Hannity and Biden, who are Catholic, which is related to \textbf{nazi} zionism(revived Roman Empire), in that the star on the flag of Israel is the same insignia found on the golden papal mitre, which unites the Romans and the Catholics, ie., the Roman Catholic Church. The zionist Rothschilds took over the finances of Vatican City in 1823, thereby putting the whole political portion of the Catholic Church in subjugation to the Khazarian mafia. Without fear, or favor, we who love ham, must tell it like it is. The zionists get a lot more money than the 3.8 billion/yr, because they get a lot of money which is earmarked for other expensive projects, but is funneled secretly, and unlawfully to them.

Though I do also agree many of the comments and opinions Ilhan Omar speaks of or tweets about does have a hidden antisemitism tone to it!!

For crying out bloody loud, this has been going on literally for centuries!!!  And each century brings with it another horrible version for a reason, solely based on \textbf{racism} and hatred, to continue on with this antisemitism mania!!  The history of antisemitism, defined as hostile actions or discrimination against Jews as a religious or \textbf{ethnic} group, goes back many centuries, with antisemitism being called "the longest hatred".  Jerome Chanes identifies six stages in the historical development of antisemitism:1. Pre-Christian anti-Judaism in Ancient Greece and Rome which was primarily \textbf{ethnic} in nature.2. Christian antisemitism in antiquity and the Middle Ages which was religious in nature and has extended into modern times.3. Muslim antisemitism which was‚Äîat least in its classical form‚Äînuanced, in that Jews were a protected class.4. Political, social and economic antisemitism of Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment Europe which laid the groundwork for racial antisemitism.5. Racial antisemitism that arose in the 19th century and culminated in Nazism.  The Holocaust!!!6. Contemporary antisemitism which has been labeled by some as the new antisemitism.Don't Forget .... Jesus Christ was Jewish!!!  He was born of a Jewish mother, in Galilee, a Jewish part of the world. All of his friends, associates, colleagues, disciples, all of them were Jewish. He regularly worshiped in Jewish communal worship, what we call synagogues. He preached from Jewish text, from the Bible. He celebrated the Jewish festivals. He went on pilgrimage to the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem where he was under the authority of priests.  He was born, lived, taught and died as a Jew. STOP all this antisemitism in any and all forms!!

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small As an Israeli, I believe critisizing the government's policy is fair game and is not antisemetic. I am opposed to many actions of my governmet and critisize it too. However, some of Ms. Omar's previous comments shown in this viedeo are baseless and either biased or stem from a lack of knowledge. (Given that she does not seem eager to critisize much worse regimes, including those of muslim countries - sadly I suspect that the first option is true). I live in the north of Tel-Aviv and have Arab muslim neighbors living in my building. All citizens of Israel - regardless of religion - enjoy human rights, are allowed to vote, and Israel has - and has always had Arab muslims represented in it's government. True, this does not include the residents of the West Bank who are not citizens of Israel; they vote in their own elections, but they are not an independant country. Many of us here wish they were a neighboring independant country, but it is a complicated issue to resolve given that many of the Palestenian leaders refuse to accept that Israel has a right to exist. Also, yes - I admit we are scared of muslims having too much influence in our country - not because we do not respect their rights - but because of how that will devestate women's rights and \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} rights here. The current situation is definately not OK, and I do not condone israeli settlement in the occupied territories - which I believe should stop. But Israel is neither attempting or conducting any genocide (that's a rediculous claim - given the force of our military, think what would happen if that were true - While actually, the population of the West Bank - same as Gaza - has been steadily growing). So bottom line - it's a complicated situation. Everyone should absolutely have the right to comment or critisize without facing backlash for being \textbf{racist}. But as a politician, you should be well informed about politics of the countries and issues you wish to critisize, and you should try to be unbiased - in some of her previous comments, I believe Ms. Omar has failed to meet that standard.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gay, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General, Sexual Identity - General, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality & \cellcolor{green!27}3/369 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.813 \\  \hline

He was found guilty on hundreds of counts, including making more than 2,000 anonymous bomb threats against mostly Jewish community centres,¬† schools and synagogues in the United States, creating panic, marketing extortion services and earning around \$240,000 in bitcoin from bomb threats -- "The goal of the defendant was to cause public panic, to send many emergency forces to the threatened area, to cause an urgent evacuation of the place, to conduct searches and scans and to create a media echo that would enhance the damage inherent in his actions," --- the court said. --- Kadar will be sentenced later and faces possible extradition to the United States to face similar hate crime charges.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small but when people criticize islam she, along with many of you, call it 'hate speech'?ironic isn't itbut here's the difference: islam has tons of theoretical and practical problems, especially true if you compare it with western secular and universal values. Those that try to 'explain' them doing dawah mostly beautify and cherrypick certain verses , leaving out the rest even when its not really implemented whenever muslims had the power to do so (eg: islamic nations, muslim own internal communities in nonmuslim nations like those islamic schools in the west)criticism of it for certain, based on actual problems and, again, even more problematic when you uphold western secular valueson the other hand, the hate against israel by muslims (nearly all of the religious ones), are mainly based on discriminative hate out of ignorance. In indonesia, the most populous muslim \textbf{nation}, also known to be 'less radical' than the arab muslim nations mainly, the muslim population nearly all of them have negative and worse attitude towards israelis and jews- there is literally no viable jewish community in the \textbf{nation}, nearly none of them ever encounter a jew in their life- they also have no idea about how the occupation starts (initiated by the arab muslim coalition own action)- they have no idea mostly about the 20 muslim arab israelis- they have no idea about the religious tolerance in israel, while not perfect, is the most proggressive and civilized (they're pretty much secular jews by now) in the whole north-african and middle-eastern region. Far better than religious tolerance in nearly all other muslim nations in the regionand you have these extremely biased reporting about the conflict, ulemas preaches demonizing jews and israel, and people share it frequently on social mediaunreasonable hate out of unreasonable basis, this is very existent among muslim communities worldwide, not just there. The same goes with ilhan omar , which is also a religious muslim with her rather-islamist views (she's also a nice friend of linda sarsour. Yes, that linda that makes Woman's March movement transformed into an anti-semitic movement, and people fall for it simply because she said she 'fights for woman')her anti semitic and anti israel views is rather obvious, the same can be seen by nearly all of the other religious muslims you, say, as a nonmuslim liberal (christian, buddhist, atheist, whatever you like), might had a more reasonable basis to criticize israel even though this still involves ignorance (as i said, israel is the most proggressive and civilized in the whole region, and palestinians are far far away from having similar views on this). Nonetheless, your concern might be 'human rights' and so onBut thats not the same with nearly all religious muslims worldwide that are anti-israel. The anti-israel propaganda out of religious basis is very \textbf{common} among their communities, so mainly the reasons they have for that is not 'legitimate criticism' (as they're doing far worse mostly) but simply religious hate, positioning them as 'muslim lands' even though it is not\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Common, Nation & \cellcolor{green!27}Nationality - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}3/510 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.588 \\  \hline
