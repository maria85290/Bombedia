  \cellcolor{green!27}\small if someone need the text here you go:) Australia's aborigianl people have faced extreme historical persecution. so much so, that in 1998 Australia implemented an annual. "National Sorry Day" This holiday serves as a form of a appologi, and it raises awarensess of indigenous populations. So who are Australia's aboriginal people? Well, Australia is home to many different indigenous populations. they include the Wiradjuri in New South Wales, and the Noongar in Western Australia. Aboriginal populations are often grouped together and referred to as "aborigines", however some consider the term pejorative. instead, legally, the native populations of Australia are referred to as "Aboriginals and torres Strait Islanders". some also prefer regional terms, like "Koori" in New South Wales, or "murri" in Queensland.Recently, a genetic study found that native Australian peoples may have left Africa up to 75,000 years ago, "likely representing one of the oldes continous populations outside Africa". For centuries they thrived in Australia usually in nomadic societies. some developed distinct tools like the boomerang, used for hunting, and the didgeridoo, a musical instrument whitch is still popular today. their extensive lagends and oral traditions are sometimes referred to as "Dreaming", and help exsplain their way of life and the world around them. by the the time eauropeans first established a colony in Australia in 1788, native populations were thought to number around 300,000, and there may have been an estimated 300 different aborigianls launguages spoken.However, with the subsequent colonization of Australia, new diseases, violence spurred by raciscm, and oppressive land-use policies deveastated many of the traditional societies. currently, aboriginal people account for just 3 of the Australian population. only about 75 aboriginal languages still remain, and many are in dagner of dying out completely. Up until several decades ago aboriginals and torres Strait Islanders, faced extreme \textbf{racism}, and goverment encroachment on their territories. many where not given Australian citizenship, nor federal suffrege until the mid 20th century. Altso, during the time, the Australian government supported forcibly taking aboriginal children away from their parents. (as we whatched a movie about) The reason for such policies varied but maby claimed it was for "chil protection" and "resocialization". The children taken away from their homes where eventually known as the "stolen Generation" and were often raised to be domestic servants and laborers. The govermant has since formally apologized for their part in creating the "Stolen Generation", and "National Sorry Day" is specifically in honnor of them.although in modern times, there has been a huge change in the governments's attitudes towards abouriginal people, high rates of unemployment, poverty, crime, and health problems for the populations persist. Aboriginal representation in the Australian government also remains low. And even today, land disputes between indigenous groups and the government are ongoing\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Racism & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/459 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.218 \\  \hline

Archaeologists in 1973 decided to look for campsites and other evidence on the Cape, finding fireplaces and middens. Although unreliable, carbon dating of shells and other organic matter was used.To the horror of the investigating academics, the best they could come up with was between 600 and 1,100 years of occupation by the Aborigines. Which begs the question; What about the claim Aborigines have lived in Australia for 40,000+ years?Aboriginal land claims, native title and land rights are based on a false anthropological premise and are totally fraudulent according to astounding new Australian archaeological discoveries and recent linguistic studies.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Race & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/213 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.939 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I'm so sick of the lies about "the stolen generations". While everyone can agree that the initial fighting against aboriginal people was wrong, the whole stolen generation things is frequently lied about. "Aboriginal children were never removed from their families in order to put an end to Aboriginality or, indeed, to serve any improper government policy or program. The small numbers of Aboriginal child removals in the twentieth century were almost all based on traditional grounds of child welfare. Most children affected had been orphaned, aban­doned, des­titute, neglected or subject to various forms of domestic violence, \textbf{sexual} exploitation and \textbf{sexual} abuse. Historians have given Western Australia a particularly loathsome reputation, but when you examine the records you find the majority of children placed in state Aborigi­nal settlements were from destitute families and they went there with their parents. In New South Wales, some children became part of an apprenticeship indenture program to help Abo­riginal youth qualify for the workforce. A significant number of other children were vol­untarily placed in institutions by Aboriginal parents to give them an education and a better chance in life."And hardly any of us take the whole sorry day things seriously. Like really you want me to apologise to a group of people I did \textbf{nothing} to, and to a group of people who have had \textbf{nothing} done to them? It's history. The truth is aboriginal people get so many benefits because of this now it is ridiculous, and much like \textbf{black} folk in the US are being incentivised to become single mothers and raise disadvantaged children, they are only being incentivised to being unambitious and unproductive individuals who live off welfare and use the money they get to buy goonbags and take taxi trips to the bottlo-O. This is a generalisation here obviously and I don't mean to say all aboriginals are like this. Of course not. But it is a large problem, which when you actually think about it, is the governments fault. We need to stop handing out all this benefits and start realising that they are just Australians, there's \textbf{nothing} extra special about them, and we need to do what the true definition of equality is, and treat them like we treat the rest of us.Having sorry day and all these aboriginal programs in schools and stuff is only adding to the division.

Yes aboriginals in certain parts of Australia lived in wiljas, but they were still, in every sense of the word, nomadic, \textbf{nothing} wrong with that.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Beau Brown I am not justifying the invasion of the Australian continent. But you must understand. Yes, invasion is morally and ethically wrong, but it has been happening for thousands of years by almost every group of people on the planet since humans migrated out of Africa over 100,000 years ago. History is not as linear as you may think. And you must remember, when aboriginals arrived on the Australian continent from south east Asia roughly 50 thousand years ago, they changed the face of Australia forever, the largest extinction event in Australia was caused by the aboriginals hunting all of the ancient mega-fauna (large marsupials) to extinction and obliterating the areas of ancient rain forest which was once widespread across Australia by burning for the purpose of hunting. So the relationship between the land and the people was not as harmonious as many people think. This is not, in any way \textbf{racist}, this is fact. The same applies in every part of the world and to all people. As I grew up, lived and currently work the Aboriginal communities across Arnhem Land I have probably done more for their cause in the past week than you have done in you're entire life.  And too you're point about Aboriginal people receiving benefits because its "their" land... Does that mean when I visit or move to Scotland, as I am an indigenous person of northern Britain, am I entitled to such benefits?\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/241 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.415 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@BeauBum89 I don't think the Europeans gave the aboriginals a better lifestyle at all. However you can't say that they were "happy" with their \textbf{old} way of life either. Happiness is totally subjective. Content, probably, as it was the only way of life they knew of. Do you think all groups of Aboriginal people were running around the continent holding hands, singing in a meadow of flowers under a rainbow of happiness or something? If you do you have an incredibly bias and warped sense of history and even reality. Life in prehistoric Australia was incredibly tough and harsh. Which is why populations were small and very sparse, as resources were sparse. Life expectancy was low and the threat of tribe vs tribe conflict was high due to said lack of resources. I am not stating these facts to belittle or degrade the aboriginal people in any way. I'm in fact doing the opposite. I greatly admire the culture and their way of life. They were able to carve out a rich culture and heritage from surviving thousands of years in almost complete isolation in such a harsh, infertile continent.Oh and please explain to me how the term 'nomadic' is \textbf{racist}. It simply means that a group of people do not permanently inhabit an area of land and must migrate to sustain their population. Many groups of people proudly preserve their nomadic way of life, such as the Mongolians and Turkic people who live on the Steppes of Central Asia.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Old, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/251 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.797 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Aussie Aboriginal culture is THE MOST complex and rich cultures i have ever been exposed too. They experienced some of the worst genocide and 'assimilation' through the stolen generation by white invaders yet the culture is still going? A lot of the culture was sadly  lost and the number of elders is decreasing very quickly and knowledge being passed on to those younger generations who traditionally become the new elders are being forced to leave there land in order to break out of the poorer conditions they are forced to live in. Even with all that and their is really no representation at all in society unless you go into these areas. As a white person I think I was exposed for about a term at school to the culture and most of it was from a white christian perspective which still has a supremacist focus. So when i got out of school and decided to learn more I was shocked at how complex it is and rich even after all of the stuff they have gone through in history and still today. Government funding goes into programs that assist in them getting a footing in modern society resulting in most of the kids still being 'stolen' from their culture subconsciously. The horrible truth is the government needs to start supporting their culture and making sure the elders are supported to sustain the culture and even help in finding lost traditions and giving them back to the people. They are very resilient people and the entire foundation of their culture is tethered to the land which we continue to take to build on which actually cuts of 'songlines' which are dreaming tracks they follow for SO MANY purposes both survival and spiritual. I can stress how obsessed i am with this culture. It is amazing and I dont get why the government is so \textbf{blind} to it.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Adding to the subject in this video about the stolen generation: I wasn't alive during that and didn't experience it and I hold the opinion that it was wrong. It really really complicates what the government can do in the present day.

A lot aren't wearing shoes or jumpers in winter and it's not uncommon to see a baby's bottle filled with fanta or coke. \textbf{Sexual} abuse and child pornography became a really big problem on the aboriginal communities (government has since banned it along with \textbf{alcohol}) and \textbf{alcohol} abuse is a huge problem for just countless countless aboriginal adults. A lot of aboriginal kids sniff glue, petrol, deodorant, nail glue etc etc. Anyway, my point is that numerous aboriginal kids are living in really bad conditions staying with their parents but it's too hard for the government to intervene unless they end up in the hospital or the police station. A lot of aboriginal kids need to be in foster homes but are left with their parents who many times have \textbf{alcohol}/substance issues to be abused, neglected, and grow up to repeat this pattern.

In a basin of the sandhill amid broken shells, he picked up a large fragmenting, football sized \textbf{lump} of petrified mud. protruding from one of the fragments he found a small bronze coin. Years later a Melbourne's  Museum Numismatist would identify it as Greek, and that it had been minted in Egypt during the reign of the Greek Ptolemy Philometor the 6th, in the 2ND century.The suggestion as to how the coin turned up where it was found is, of course, that it had been left behind by  ancient visitors; Greek explorers perhaps, or even Arabs, Indians and Malayans with whom the Greeks traded. Similarly, in 1961 a family picnicking on the Daly river, west of Katherine in the Northern Territory, found a Gold Scarab, on object of worship of the Ancient Egyptians.

There have been cases in some tribes where the elders have \textbf{sexual} rights to all young women. A lot of people don't realise they get paid benefits from the government that come close to some peoples full time income. This allows them to not need to work which may sound great but it causes problems because a lot of them just drink and use drugs which once again leads to crime and child abuse. While this is a regularly the case I've also worked with several aborigines that work hard and are perfectly civil people.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@SirGooglinMort Smith True at first and there was and still are problems but that was only guise then they went way overboard when then they started forcefully and brutally removing children just because they were "half-caste" (like myself) and mixed \textbf{race} Aboriginals, some literally taken from the hospital not long after birth and was sending them all to missions and institutions to be raised as essentially servants and laborers."Policemen or other agents of the state (such as 'Aboriginal Protection Officers') were given the power to locate and transfer babies and children of mixed descent from their mothers or families or communities into institutions. In these Australian states and territories, half-caste institutions (both government and missionary) were established in the early decades of the 20th century for the reception of these separated children.""The report closely examined the distinctions between "forcible removal", "removal under threat or duress", "official deception", "uninformed voluntary release", and "voluntary release". The evidence indicated that in a large number of cases children were brutally and forcibly removed from their parent or parents, possibly even from the hospital shortly after their birth. Aboriginal Protection Officers often made the judgement on removal.""In some cases, families were required to sign legal documents to relinquish care to the state. In Western Australia, the Aborigines Act 1905 removed the legal guardianship of Aboriginal parents and made their children all legal wards of the state, so no parental permission was required""In 1915, in New South Wales, the Aborigines Protection Amending Act 1915 gave the Aborigines' Protection Board authority to remove Aboriginal children "without having to establish in court that they were neglected"; it was alleged by Professor Peter Read that Board members sometimes wrote simply "For being Aboriginal" as the explanation when recording a removal""In 1911, the Chief Protector of Aborigines in South Australia, William Garnet South, reportedly "lobbied for the power to remove Aboriginal children without a court hearing because the courts sometimes refused to accept that the children were neglected or destitute". South argued that "all children of mixed descent should be treated as neglected". His lobbying reportedly played a part in the enactment of the Aborigines Act 1911; this made him the legal guardian of every Aboriginal child in South Australia, including so-called "half-castes"""The Bringing Them Home report also identified instances of official misrepresentation and deception, such as when caring and able parents were incorrectly described by Aboriginal Protection Officers as not being able to properly provide for their children, or when parents were told by government officials that their children had died, even though this was not the case.""The report discovered that removed children were, in most cases, placed into institutional facilities... Children taken to such places were frequently punished if caught speaking local indigenous languages, and the intention was specifically to prevent them being socialised in Aboriginal cultures, and raise the boys as agricultural labourers and the girls as domestic servants."\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/489 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.204 \\  \hline

In that sense Terra Nullius was technically correct since the existing Aboriginal populations made no claims to ownership.

Most people think that Australia should be run by the government, so it runs the country by the consent of the people. That's how all forms of government work. You can't rule unless everybody else is willing to go along with it.There's also the issue that you can't give the country back to the aboriginal people because there is no aboriginal people. There are hundreds of different groups which have moved around and mixed together with no \textbf{common} governing structure or body capable of being in charge. Australia simply could not exist now without all of the non-aboriginal people and the government and infrastructure they brought with them.

Is the establishment of a penal colony really the same as an invasion? Were the Eora (in the Sydney area) treated better or worse than the mostly white convicts?

Their guns were also ineffective against the spears.15months after the whites had first arrived in Australia, they were desperately waiting for supplies \& in serious danger of being taken down by the natives, then suddenly a pox disease hit the native colony across the harbour, a distance that is still today over 40 minutes by boat to get to. The pox disease wiped out 90 of those in that area \& spread throughout the Sydney basin, taking out between 50 \& 70 of the natives, while not effecting anyone in the colony. The origins are known from Banks journals as he was returning \& documenting less \& less natives as he got closer to the colony. Presumably if he had known the cause, he wouldn't have made these records, no other records were made (or they were made \& destroyed)We still try to deny what happened there, try to claim the disease got there some other way, try to claim the pox was chicken pox spread by a man with shingles (despite the distance \& not a single child in the colony where he was living fulltime getting chicken pox) The surgeon's supply list makes it pretty clear what really happened - in his supplies were a jar of smallpox scabs! It's pretty clear that someone high up in the colony ordered those scabs be used as biological warfare \& released a safe distance from the colony to wipe out all resistance from the native people.One day, we as a \textbf{nation} will grow up enough to acknowledge our past \& maybe even have a discussion as to what the reasons/justifications in their eyes may have been.

Should you apologize to the descendants of those people that were killed or otherwise wronged by your ancestors? I understand where you're coming from but I think you're a bit too naive and idealistic about this to see it for what it is, and you're muddling the commemoration of sacrifices (ww1 memorial) with an interaction between two groups of people apologizing for something that neither group had any participation in.

Like with the Huns and the Vikings, the America (and 13 colonies before that) that committed the genocide against native Americans is dead. You can't hold that America accountable for that genocide because it doesn't exist anymore, the America that exists now is notably different, though it shares a name. Especially given that no one that lived during that genocide is alive now. It's the exact same point you made with the Huns and Vikings, the only difference is the name lived on and you can easily point your finger at what remains because of that."When you have a National Sorry Day, you as a individual are not apologizing.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@13ullseye Native Americans still suffer (greatly) from the horrific crimes and genocide committed against them by European settlers and the government of the United States, though. And it would make a great difference, if only in attitude, considering the atrocities in America were much greater than even the ones committed in Australia. The US did give a half-assed apology in 2009, but it was buried deep in a bill of unrelated topics. Most US citizens still have no idea the magnitude of the atrocities committed against Natives, and a "Sorry Day" would bring attention to those historical injustices that were committed  still have an enormous effect on the lives of nearly all Native Americans (at least those who live on reservations) in the USA today. Keep in mind, Native Americans were nearly wiped out by genocide brought on them by Europeans and their plight was only exacerbated by the US Gov. If someone like Christopher Columbus can have a national holiday in the USA, it should go without question that the people who survived a genocide and had their land forcefully stolen from them by the USA so that the \textbf{nation} could exist should get at least some recognition.

In addition the fact that no one alive took part in it makes it more questionable.Instead, if there was something akin to the \textbf{black} history month in the US but for native americans I think that would go a lot further to making a difference in regards to recognition (and also avoid piling on blame to people that had \textbf{nothing} to do with it) - but a simple "oops, we dun goof'd" day is a paltry and generally lackluster solution, don't you think? Regardless of how you feel about a group of people apologizing for something they had no direct part in to another group of people; I expect you would agree that a simple "sorry day" is rather lacking.The whole columbus day thing is a different topic altogether, I'd certainly agree that it's not really a 'day' worth having, and I'm not entirely sure why it is one.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!27}2/208 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.962 \\  \hline
