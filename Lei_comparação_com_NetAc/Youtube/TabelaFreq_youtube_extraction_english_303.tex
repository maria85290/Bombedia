  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Alltime10s please do your research properly first before you make a video. Japan tried to invade Australia and they didn't abandon it for those reasons. The 39th battalion and many other battalions fought for our country all along the Kokoda track in Papua New \textbf{Guinea} for years. Even a lot of the local people helped us fight and helped the injured soldiers. The Japanese never gave up until they got pushed back by our amazing and persistent soldiers to the coast of PNG. They bombed our northern towns for years. They really wanted Australia for their own. They didn't give up until we pushed them so far back that they had to. Please don't take credit from our forces that worked hard, got injured, came out with PTSD and died for our country. Please take more time to research before you post a video. You got one thing right though. Yes, Australia would be a tough country to invade. Because we work hard for what we want.

ROVs, Cruise missiles, stealth and other tech allows for deep penetration and precise strikes at infrastructure, like power plants.  Had Hitler had the laser guided bombs and planes to reach deep inside Russia in 1940-41, Russia would have loss WWII.  USSR's victory was based on 3 key factors.  First the willingness of the Soviet people to throw themselves at the Germans.  Second the second industrial revolution in Russia; where upon German's invasion Russia started moving its factories to the Ural Mountains and out of reach of the Germans.  Add conditions 1 \& 2 plus an over stretched German supply line and yes Russia couldn't be conquered.  But add the 3rd element and that is Allied lend-lease....the US gave Russia 58,000 train locomotives and hundreds of thousands of trucks freeing Russia from having to make those trucks and focus on weapons--Russia with Allied help was the 3rd fully mechanized army in WWII and no Germany was never fully mechanized---the three being US, UK and Russia You can forget nukes...if someone is \textbf{dumb} enough to envade Russia, China, US or anyone else that has them, the invader likely has them too... pop the cork on a nuke on any side and its game over and it doesn't matter if you save yourself from invasion or if your the invader...your all dead and now one will be left to write the history\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Dumb & \cellcolor{green!5}Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}1/317 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.315 \\  \hline

India and china both has blue water naval capabilities , nuclear submarines and Aircraft carriers, destroyers, frigates . By the way you should know that India is also an ally of Australia. It will be \textbf{Indian} Navy which will be impose a naval blockade on China in \textbf{Indian} ocean to block all trade and supplies of China if china advances on australia. (The sea route of \textbf{Indian} ocean is life line of china , that's why china is desperate for alternative called as CPEC , Ironically that alternative is also not immune from India as it passes through karakoram pass and India sitting on Siachen glacier can block it) .\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Indian & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Native-American & \cellcolor{green!5}3/208 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.442 \\  \hline

Very few countries have nuclear weapons, For your info Germany and Japan doesn't have. - India is a nuclear triad country    Only four nuclear triad countries are there in world i.e USA, Russia, China and India   (France was former, it has capability but not operational now).     - Nuclear Submarines   Very few countries have indigenous nuclear submarines, For your info Germany and Japan doesn't have.-  Aircraft Carrier which can operate fixed wing fighter jets.   Very few countries have indigenous Aircraft careers, For your info Germany and Japan doesn't have.   - Intercontinental Ballistic missiles.    Very few countries have indigenous ICBMs, For your info Germany and Japan doesn't have.  On top of this India has it Nuclear tipped.- Very wide variety of indigenously developed missiles with launching capabilities from Surface, Air and under water.- Supersonic Speed Cruise Missile Brahmos (Soon to be Hypersonic)  It is the world's fastest anti-ship cruise missile in operation.The missile travels at speeds of Mach 2.8 to 3.0,which is being upgraded to Mach 5.0.  Guess what Germany and Japan doesn't have anything close to match capability and speed of this cruise missile.- India's own IRNSS ( You understand the importance of GPS in modern warfare right)  It is like US GPS currently covers only \textbf{Indian} subcontinent but expanding range in progress.   Even now it serves it purpose well as India doesn't attack anyone , and if attacked then well it can provide navigational and positioning data.  Guess what here again your fav. Germany and Japan doesn't have its own such capability.- Capability to Shoot down satellites. Demonstrated by shooting down own satellite for test.  For your info Germany and Japan doesn't have this capability.- Indigenous technology to build , launch and maintain satellites of wide variety.    No one can know how many of \textbf{Indian} satellites are Military satellite as India makes and launches it itself.    So no one gets a peek at it what kind of satellite it is.    If you give your satellites to make or launch to other country then that country will know what you have, That is not the case with India.   Country not capable is at mercy of other as the country with launch capability might decide that you have enough of your military satellites already and deny launching it.   Since India can build and launch on its own so it is not dependent on any other country's mercy.       One of your fav. Japan has capabilities of launching satellites but Germany on its own does not have -> It depends on EU.  -  Main battle Tanks    You might be in delusion that it is bad quality but once you face it you would know.-  Wide Variety of Armoured Vehicles.-  Assault Rifles and variety of small arms- India's 70 indigenous 4th Generation fighter jet.   Work is in progress to make to 100 indigenous but i agree it will take considerable time.- Missle defence system.- World's second largest army moderately equipped if not highly equipped like US soldiers.Also India has huge experience of war. During 1st and second world war there were more soldiers from British \textbf{Indian} army compared to British army fighting all over europe.Also British \textbf{Indian} airforce. British \textbf{Indian} army was formed in 1858 and british \textbf{Indian} airforce was formed in 1932.After independence These two became \textbf{Indian} Army and \textbf{Indian} Airforce. Even after Independence \textbf{Indian} Military has fought 5 wars and have experience of creating naval blockades and all kinds of operational experience.Then India has been fighting insurgency and doing counter terrorism which has put \textbf{Indian} forces in constant operational mode since last 70 years.Due to tensions with suicidal \textbf{nation} pakistan , \textbf{Indian} forces are on operational high alert all the time. After having this kind of huge battle experience , Current generation of \textbf{Indian} forces are also battle hardened and won't panic in case of war, like German current generation forces who has just got born and living in a calm sweet place with not even a bullet fired outside shooting range.After all these \textbf{Indian} indigenous capabilities and technology there are imports of very high tech military equipment.But important fact is that India has its own indigenous capabilities and technologies for the most critical things which no one sells to other countries.Above is the reason why India stand at 4th place in world's most powerful militaries.India hold's 4th position mainly because it has most critical military tech indigenous (which no country sells to others),Not only because of its import, though imports also helps.Hope you understand the reality and wake up. Stop living in 19th century.PS : Japan is very advance country technically. But it doesn't concentrate and work on military technology , Mainly because restrictions imposed by US on Japan after second world war , restricting japan to maintain a very small troop and no military tech advancement as per agreement.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Neo Maisela Incentive is there, China will gulp Bhutan in a moment if \textbf{Indian} army is not standing in way. Have a read on  "Doklam stand off" between Chinese and \textbf{Indian} army in Bhutan. Occupying Bhutan will give Chinese immense strategical  advantage as Bhutan is located at a very very important place strategically. Chinese occupied Tibbet for same reason.  Officially Chinese claims Tibbet , parts of India , parts of Bhutan (or whole Bhutan) as its own because of ancient historical boundaries. Chinese even tried to invade Arunachal from india which is located just next to Bhutan and has the same geography, But could not occupy it after a brief war. But Chinese succeeded in occupying parts of Laddakh region of India in the northern part of India. That is a land which is pure cold desert, not even a grass grows there. So what was the incentive?  Two things - one it got it pride satisfied as it claimed it to be part of China , second it got land access to Middle east , and Arabian sea via pakistan. Though China could occupy only a small part and not the whole region it claimed to be Chinese. The stand off between Chinese and \textbf{Indian} armies happens very frequently on these very high altitude regions. In fact Siachen Glacier (Elevation: 5,400 m) is the world's highest battle ground which falls particularly in this region and is a tri-junction of \textbf{Indian} , Chinese and Pakistani control. This Cold and high glacier is strategically very important that why troops stand there at an elevation of 5,400 m in temperature which can dip to −50 °C (−58 °F) though out the year.  It is a glaciated portion of the Karakoram so cold that  sometimes called the "Third Pole".Millions of dollars are spend to maintain troops on such a place, and many soldiers dies because of cold not bullets. So you see in Modern \textbf{age} geography is not going to play a very Big role in defending country from a technically very advance country. Those are things of past. The list compiled in this video does this mistake of relying heavily on geography for protection.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Neo Maisela //India doesn't really have any geographical advantages/ We are talking about full scale invasion here.Have you ever seen a MAP in your life before you comment such a absurd thing on public forum? North of India is all HUGE "The Great Himalayas", highest mountain range in the world, World's top 50 highest peaks falls in these Himalayan mountain range . You can come through only a few handful mountain passes , that too not open through out the year. Western Border is Pakistan from which India is constantly on war since 1947. So you will get a bullet in head before even getting close to that border, It is one of the world's most militarized zone, Also Most of that western border is either Thar DESERT (yeah desert with Sand like Sahara) or High Mountains of Himalayas. whatever left of western border is Runn of kutch  , that is another form of desert. These is very little ground on western border using which you can come in India without encountering either Thar Desert or Himalayan mountain range. Eastern Part of India is very thick Dense forest. Even more dense than Vietnam where US soldiers got screwed very badly. It is one of world's highest rainfall receiving area. To add your difficulty  India has specially trained big troops for gorilla warfare in these forests as we have a threat from china. China even attacked in 1962 and tried to capture Arunachal Pradesh, one state of India which Chinese claims as their territory till today.Rest of Southern , south East and South west of India is Ocean . So you need a very very advance and BIG navy to reach the shore after winning from Big \textbf{Indian} Navy which has nuclear submarines , good number of destroyers , frigates and even 2 Air craft carriers. Only USA can get past it as of now , no one else. You can cross these geographical barriers only if you have a very very advance army. After that You have to tackle with World's second largest army personnel wise , and World's 4th most powerful Military (Army, Airforce, Navy combined).Ranking top 5 is USA , Russia , China , India, France.India is also a nuclear triad country, There are only 4 nuclear triad country in world i.e USA , Russia , China and India. (France was a former nuclear triad , still has capability but not operational).India has Inter continental ballistic missiles (ICBM). Only seven countries has ICBMs (USA,Russia,China,India,France,Israel, North korea)These nuclear submarine, nuclear triad , ICBM are India's indigenous tech , i am not counting imported weapons.Also India has its own operational GPS navigation system (though it covers \textbf{Indian} subcontinent as of now , but we are talking about invasion of India , not India attacking someone else so this will work) ,  India is not on mercy of providing GPS services by any other \textbf{nation} during a conflict or war.Don't think about shooting down \textbf{Indian} satellites , because India too have its own indigenous technology and capability to shoot down satellites as India already demonstrated by shooting down one of its own satellite. And India has own capability to launch satellites and operate. So It is even impossible for USA for doing a full scale invasion of India after crossing those geographical barriers of Himalayan range , Thar desert , Dense rain forests, Ocean and then fighting with world's 4th most powerful military.Even if we assume USA Wins all these then India is not a small country. It is world's 7th largest country by size (land area) , that too very diverse having deserts , dense rain forests , huge coastline , high mountain ranges.  What is true about Australia and USA about difficulties in invasion because of big size and diverse landscape is also holds true for India. I talked about USA because there is a huge gap between USA and the one which comes second. Others don't even qualify to attack India for short term leave alone thinking about invasion. We have very frequent occurrences of Chinese and \textbf{Indian} army standoffs in the disputed region which both countries  claims and armies of both country do regular patrolling.  \textbf{Indian} and Chinese armies just push each other using hands , if it escalated then they throw stones at each other. But Never Fire a bullet as it can lead to escalation and war which neither China not India can afford. Imagine Word's 3rd and 4th most powerful military power going full scale war. how devastating.So Think again about the quality and scope of the knowledge you have.

They were not 'immigrants' because there was no established society for them to move to. Without the white settlers, what is known as 'America' would still be an unnamed continent full of migratory tribes.."(Ann Coulter, Adios America,2015, p.51) "Every single president, except Kennedy, was a Protestant. (Recent Democratic presidents were, of course, atheists, but all except JFK professed to be Protestants." (Ann Coulter, Adios America,2015, p.53)"For one hundred years before the signing of the Declaration, and one hundred years after, America was extraordinarily un-diverse in \textbf{ethnicity} (British, Dutch, West \textbf{African}, and Germanic), in religious practice (overwhelmingly Protestant, 98 percent Christian), in language (English), and in cultural mores.......And the country remained overwhelmingly Anglo-Saxon and Protestant right up until Teddy Kennedy decided to change it." (Ann Coulter, Adios America,2015, pp.53,54)"Contrary to PC nonsense about America being a 'diverse' melting pot, America has never been a '\textbf{nation} of immigrants.' Most Americans have always been born here.  Even as late as 1990 — a quarter century into Teddy Kennedy's scheme to remake the \textbf{nation} — half of the American population traced its roots to the \textbf{black} and white populace of 1790.(9)" "Nearly the entire white population of America from 1600 to 1970 came from a geographic area of the world about twice the size of Texas. The entire \textbf{black} population came from an area of West Africa about the size of Florida." "Until Teddy Kennedy struck, America was never less than 99 percent white Western European and West \textbf{African} \textbf{black}.(10)  That's 'bi-racial,' not 'diverse.'" (Ann Coulter, Adios America,2015, p.54)"Two centuries after the first Europeans settled America, the white population was  80 percent British and 98 percent Protestant.(12)  A century after that, the populace was  still overwhelmingly English-speaking, British, and Protestant, but, for an exciting  change, also included Germans and Scandinavians.(13) The colorful immigrants at the turn of the nineteenth century were wildly different from the original settlers in the sense that they were white people from a different part of Western Europe." (Ann Coulter, Adios America,2015, p.55)"The entire time it was processing immigrants from 1892 until 1954, Ellis Island  received only 12 million immigrants.(15)"  (Ann Coulter, Adios America, 2015, Page 56)   Can Anyone Prove  the Above Statements  Wrong from a  book called:  "Adios  America" ?==============================================================================================================================================================43 'The \textbf{alien} who is among you shall rise higher and higher above you, and you shall come down lower and lower. 44 He shall lend to you, but you shall not lend to him; he shall be the head, and you shall be the tail.45 'Moreover all these curses shall come upon you and pursue and overtake you, until you are destroyed, because you [a]did not obey the voice of the LORD your God, to keep His commandments and His statutes which He commanded you.'(Deuteronomy 28:43-45 New King James Version-NKJV)\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}African, Alien, Black, Ethnicity, Nation & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}8/607 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.318 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I don't know where the fool is from, but it is obviously not any of the western democracies from the propaganda soaked rhetoric he is spewing.  Regardless, all of this dick measuring bullshit, it is all really rather irrelevant... Because this is the era of the globe spanning American Empire; and this is simply a fact of all humanity's reality currently.    The military aspect is all quite true \& wholly real; more so than any given civilian even knows for there are.... "Toys", technological terrors that not even most in the U.S. government know about, not even any of the last 5 or so presidents, much less any members of Congress...   ☆Such as certain space based weapons systems, which can surgically strike \& completely incinerate ANYTHING, at ANYTIME, ANYWHERE on the entire planet... And leaving behind no radiation residuals. (Try picturing something similar to the Watchtower beam weapon from that Justice League cartoon.)  EMP brownbox tech, unbelievably advanced cyber systems mangling "sharks", aircraft so quiet and practically invisible, to much more than just radar, that maneuver like hummingbirds and fly faster and higher than anything any other \textbf{nation} has actually conceived of as being possible... both manned and unmanned variants.  The initial prototypes back in the mid 70's was what some have heard called the "Aurora project"... That was never actually the name though, some UFO seekers came up with that pretty little nomenclature for what was "heard" but never Seen by a few of them.    The only issue is that this is not directly under any U.S. conventional military control, none of the known branches at least.  So it isn't at the disposal of any of our elected officials, they do not actually know about these particular agencies, and considering the fool in office currently I'm thankful that is the case.  Basically what you should take away from this, just as a little something to consider when you are deluding yourselves about how much any \textbf{nation}'s military actually matters in the grand scheme of things is this... Your shithole countries are \textbf{nothing} but an illusory curtain to keep your primitive asses placated and complacently working at your menial jobs... with generation after generation of you filling the labor pools of obedient, submissive, ignorant proletariat masses.    You are as absolutely insignificant as it is possible for a human being to become, you aren't really even a cog in the machine, your just waste byproducts.  You and yours could not make an actual impact upon what is happening, not even if you were shown the complete reality of the situation could you do a thing to alter it.   Be happy existing in your pathetic religious delusions, your nationalistic propaganda which effectively deceives you into thinking your country or culture have real significance and power, all of the systematically layered pacification illusions which keep them from having to decimate the useless living populations of humanity around this World... Because you do not wish to have to live with the knowledge of what the reality of your life's meaning truly consists of, it would be quite unbearable I assure you.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nation, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/517 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.387 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small As an Aussie, let me tell you why you can't invade Australia:  First, the worldwide assessment of Australia's millitary is that it is small, and that's all they see.  But Australia's military spending  is high, its infrastructure very modern, very well trained, and geared for power projection.  That's why Australia is involved in every conflict the west has been involved in for 100 years.  We are battle-hardened and could give a \textbf{nation} with a much larger millitary a very hard time.  Ask the japanese survivors of the Coral Sea, Milne Bay and Kakoda what Aussies can do.  Ask German survivors of the North \textbf{African} campaign why even the best soldiers from Germany let by their greatest general Rommel couldn't win.  We are rated year after year as the World's 15th most powerful country, around 20th millitarily, and since the English colonized Australia \textbf{nobody} has ever landed an enemy force here.  But besides that, Australia  has never had a civil war, we are all mates here and fierce about our homeland.  Then consider what happens if you DO manage to land troops in Australia.  You would not  be able to sail down the coast where the Navy and Air Force are stationed, you have to land on the top end, and you can bet that the goverment with blow up the dams, destroy the roads, bridges and rail lines and scorch everything of value.  Your army would have to travel off-road through thousands of kms of some of the world's most wild and brutal terrain while some of the world's toughest soldiers  make your life hell and the RAAF  (with almost 500 flying attack aircraft including F35's targets your fuel and water supply and the navy (which includes 2 aircraft carriers) keeps your supply lines on the bottom of the \textbf{Indian} Ocean.   But of course, we are not alone anyway, we have very powerful strategic alliances  tested over decades of the closest cooperation.  Australia is - by choice - part of the British Commonwealth and thus a tight ally of England, the world's 5th or 6th more powerful military.   An attack on Australia is an attack on the UK and that means an attack on NATO.  Oh, and there are probably no two military forces on earth as closely allied and tight as the USA's and Australia's, they train together, fight together, war together.  Even if the ANZUS treaty (regularly re-pledged and renewed) did not guarantee immediate support of the USA and their vast millitary machine, the fact that we are their best mates would be enough to bring them in like the jugganaut they are... and the fact that there are crucial joint USA/Australian millitary fbased scattered all over the outback is just an added beniefit.   The USA is \textbf{nothing} if not pragmatic.  So here is the bottom line:  Australia is nobodies' enemy and everyone's mate.   Even Indonesia ,Australia's  closest and occasionally hostile \textbf{nation} gets more in tourism from the 5 million Aussies a year who go there to drink the county dry of beer than they would get from trying to take the country over.   Besides, Australai sent troops in to East Timor a decade or so ago and the Indonesian army backed off, they don't want to war either.

Unlike the Iraqi soldiers who were very low on morale and low patriotism in both wars, the Iranians actually havy very high morale and very high patriotism, believe me, they would even fight with their bare hands and blow themselves up in suicide attacks if they had to (like the Japanese Kamikaze in 1944). This is the big difference between Iran today and the Iraq back then. Many Iraqis actually hated Saddam Hussein and were happy when his regime was finally over. Of course, there are also many Iranians in Iran who hate their government, but even more Iranians who would die to defend their country agaisnt an American attack. Even if they had no chance, they would still fight and die proudfully even if it's just to get to their 76 virgins in paradise... they have \textbf{nothing} to lose, you know waht I mean?

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I think even without the United States military the United States would still be number one. The United States of America makes up only 4 of the world population, but the CIVILIAN population of the United States holds upwards of 600 MILLION firearms (half of the entire world's stock) and more than 25 TRILLION rounds of ammunition. Including the fact that United States civilians legally possess tanks, explosives, machine guns. The civilian population holds more weaponry than the United States military, more than Russia and the other top 25 militaries combined.  Then combined with our very intense culture of patriotism, and our near religious commitment to the idea of defending our \textbf{nation} against foreign invasion, both products of our \textbf{nation}'s founding being a civilian lead gorilla-style war for Independence against the then world's largest empire. I think any invasion of the United States would fail decisively even if the invading force was as large as the United States military and the United States had only civilians fighting back, for a few good reasons. Our outdoorsman "hunting, shooting, etc" culture means many many Americans know to shoot very well, at long distances, and know their lands very well and have experience hunting from  a young \textbf{age}. Our uniquely extensive road systems and driving culture, means almost every American can drive and owns at least 1 vehicle, meaning transportation of weaponry, manpower, or supplies by ground vehicles would be unstoppable and nearly every citizen could be capable of aiding the resistance effort. Our fervent deep seeded patriotism that's present irrespective of political leanings would unify Americans greater than any cause, especially if our homeland was actually at direct threat, I think that the vast majority of Americans would be willing to fight for their country if it was directly being invaded. Our culture of grassroots militia groups means that even before the general population reacts, the united States' 271 current civilian militias that have the weaponry, training, and passion to fight, would react instantly and are present in every single state. Our gun culture and world class ownership of firearms by civilians, more than any population or military on Earth, I don't think I have to explain why that's an advantage. America is very divided amongst itself politically, but if any \textbf{nation} be actually invaded, I think you'd see a civilian war mobilization and extreme unification happen instantly. We literally dream about this shit, we practically deify the idea of a Minuteman, a civilian soldier during the revolutionary war who's namesake comes from being ready to fight anytime at a minute's notice.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Nation & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/430 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.698 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small So many people with little to no knowledge about warfare or capabilities talking about war. First, the guy talking about Tsar bomba. The bomb is disarmed because its more likely to fail than actually do what it was created the do, hence it's in a Museum in Russia. For Russia and China to be able to make an attempt to Invade the US, they would have to do so from Land because at sea the US is superior by a great margin to both. Neither Russia nor China has a military capable of invading any \textbf{nation} capable of defending itself, let along a more powerful \textbf{nation} than themselves. Russia has a history of Genocide, and China has a history of bearly winning wars at its own border. Now, for Russia and China having any capable attempt of invading the US (even then highly unlikely) they would spend about half a year to one and a half year moving troops across the countries and sea while the US watches with a happy face shouting "sweet! new neighbors" and as we all know, the US isn't Canada hence a blockade would more than likely stop the mobilizing and the US would attack those already on group and block anyone from helping them. In a nuclear scenario both sides will be busy trying to salvage what's left, so that's highly unlikely neither side would do. Since I know some will say "how about the US in the middle east, or Vietnam" well guerilla warfare and traditional warfare are two very different things. As in war between nations you have clear targets before you even attack, versus guerilla warfare, you have to spend tons of time tracking them down and its like finding the needle in the haystack and then kill the needle without harming any of the hay versus in a war where there are direct targets like infrastructure, military bases (that most countries in the world pre any war knows about the opponent).Then again, the US could not invade China or Russia in a traditional war it would need the will of the people in said countries to overthrow the government and not start a guerilla warfare that would last for decades, but the US is capable of destroying the armies of China and Russia but will have trouble invading either of them. So no, China and Russia can't invade the US, and it's highly unlikely that the US could invade either of them also, but more likely.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nation & \cellcolor{green!5}Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/417 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.48 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The logic of the Palestinians who want the death of the Jews:In the establishment of the state, the Jews flee from the Holocaust to their land, which has \textbf{nothing} and rebuild it.The Palestinians did not want to live with the Jews. Even at the establishment of the state, the Jews offered them to build the country and went to war against Israel together with six different countries (of course, once peace is offered, the most logical response is war). Israel is winning the war, building a glorious state, and is still trying to make peace with the Palestinians.After the establishment of the State of Israel and until now - in the government there was a law that can not shoot a \textbf{terrorist} even if he comes to stab you. It is permissible to shoot him in the legs, and this too if he has already raised his hand. And what are the Palestinians distributing in the world today? "Israel murders Palestinian children every day."You try to hit and kill Jews every hour of the day. Are we bombing hospitals and children? Let me tell you something ...We are transferring money to Hamas, billions of dollars a year. Our goal is for Hamas to build shelters and protected areas with this money, and maybe even open their own country, so their residents will be safe from our bombings ... Still child murderers? Ok.There is something in Israel called the "knock on the door." We announce the building we are going to attack a few hours before the attack so that all the citizens can be evacuated from the building and thus be saved. What is Hamas doing?They send rocket launchers to hospitals and schools and leave the children and people there and as soon as they receive the message of the approaching attack they simply ignore it and thus a lot of people die as a result of attacks that our goal is to destroy weapons depots and specific targets.And then all over the world you hear about Israel that again murders children and innocent people, while the one responsible for this is their government, Hamas.I do not expect all of you to believe everything I said here. I expect you to pass it on! I think it's time to put the truth out because I, as a Jewish Israeli citizen, know the truth. I have Arab friends and they are not murdered in the streets as the Palestinians love to tell you ... Everything you heard is all lies. Do not believe me? So shut up! You have no right to criticize only by false reports by Hamas and the Palestinians. You are invited to come to Israel and enjoy its beauty and see the truth in your face. You will see religious Jewish people eating lunch together with Palestinians who only want peace. You will see Palestinians and Jews working together and laughing together. You will see the truth. All those who read all this and still do not believe ... I can only wish you success.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nothing, Terrorist & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Religious Identity - Muslim & \cellcolor{green!5}2/516 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.388 \\  \hline

YOu should also know that the nuclear strategy of France is the most dangerous of all (alongwith Israel we are the only contry that state that in case of invasion we lauch the totality of our nuclear arsenal...China, Russia, USA have a different strategy they would only lauch a limited amount of their nuclear weapons first then increase the number of lauching accordingly to the answer of the enemy, the French are the craziest, form the beginning we send all we have everywhere !).

Is the \textbf{Indian} navy any better? You also have to factor in Australia's huge size, terrain and location. Any invading force would have to be done by sea so they'd need to go through Indonesia (To shorten time) Those waterways are extremely important for trade. You'd need to go through Indonesia then find a suitable place to land your units. Know expecting you've gone through Indonesia without a problem you are now facing the sparsely populated, extremely hot and open desert of Northern Australia.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Ranjeet Varma well you are forgetting that it is not 1971 anymore and the predictions you are showing are a little out of the mark. If you think in that way then no country is safe from no one. There is a difference between invading a country and attacking a country from a rented outpost island. \textbf{Indian} navy has a huge presence in \textbf{Indian} Ocean and has a major advantage of trade route blocks. India can block the trade route of both USA and China from the \textbf{Indian} Ocean which will posses a deadly threat to these countries in the time of war. Also India is one of the major importer from China and USA so these countries will never attack India even if they are settled on islands near India. Plus India also has navy superiority in that region because of BRAMHOS missile system which is impossible to be attacked by defence missile systems once launched. And in Himalayas although China and Pakistan have moderate presence, the highest points are mostly under control of India which in military term is a huge advantage. Also the Himalaya makes it impossible for other countries to call air strike on India or bring tanks near \textbf{Indian} border. And about USA nuking India, the thing is USA have signed a pact where it can no longer test or produce nuclear weapons and the war heads in their arsenal are 50+ year \textbf{old} and the actual shelf life of a nuclear war head is only 20 years whereas India has signed no such treaty and continues to stock its arsenal. In 1971 India was a third world country and now India is the 6th largest economy in the world with a reputation of world's 4th largest superpower. I think you can  have the peace of mind that on other countries are attacking India in their sane mind. And once more, did I mention that India is the only country which is ready to fight a war on the both sides.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Indian, Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - Native-American & \cellcolor{green!27}5/336 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.488 \\  \hline

The soviets were one of the reasons why Japan surrendered, but it was because of the atom bombs and the US invasions that WAS already happening. The USSR came to the pacific front after US. Stop mixing things up with the Russo-Sino war. And you are probably thinking of Soviet liberation of Manchuria, which is outside of Korea. And to tell you the truth, you were spreading false information. US lost all battles? BS. If that was the case, the US would have lost the Revolutionary war, Spanish-American war, WW 1, WW 2, Iraq War, and the Cold War, which is not really a war by itself but the US still won. US, with no mention of the allies, lost three out of four fronts of the entire war? BS. If that was the case, the Axis would have lasted longer. Ha! Low intelligence? That's all people like you can say to America, which is just really sad as you have said \textbf{nothing} but BS the entire time (except for the US taking all the credit.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small andrew lee I never stated that the Soviet's landed their people first on the moon. And the Soviet's had their flag on the moon first, because they sent it up in a space craft that landed on the moon. US was the first to plant their flag INTO the moon sure. I don't know why you keep on bringing up the pacific front, because noone is talking about that but you. I guess to make America look good. We're talking about the liberation of North Korea. Please come back when you're able to join us on that subject. When Japan did "surrender", some Japanese did not, and kept on fighting until the 1970's. Yes the Peace Treaty is what formally ended the war, and the joint Decleration between Japan and the Soviet Union is what formally ended their war. But don't forget that the USSR was led by the savage Joseph Stalin. The Soviets were already fighting Japan before America dropped the bombs, (which didn't kill off that many Japanese as you would think). It's said that Japan was going to surrender anyway at the end of 1945 because they knew they weren't going to win. All the bombs did was push this a little faster. After the drop of the first atom bomb the Japanese were told to get ready for more. In fact Japanese kids are taught this in schools, and not that big bad America saved the day with their atom bombs. You should read a detailed article called: "The Bomb Didn't Beat Japan... Stalin Did".As for US losing the battles, I did not say that US lost ALL battles. So no, I was not and am not spreading false information about that. You're just putting words in my mouth. Please don't do that. The Revolutionary War, The Spanish-American War, and The Cold War have no relevance here, because BLITZ was/is not talking about those. I suggest you read, or re-read his comment, to know what wars he stated. All the information I put down stating the wars that BLITZ mentioned is correct. If you don't believe me then Google is your friend.I did not mention allies in the American fronts, because BLITZ did not mention allies in the American fronts. We're not talking about allies here, just America's participation. Try to keep up. Would you like to know that America lost their fronts even with allies? That just seems more embarrasing. And BLITZ did state that America fought two of the fronts mostly on their own."Ha! Low intelligence? That's all people like you can say to America". That's because a lot of Americans are \textbf{dumb}. Don't act \textbf{dumb}, and you won't be called \textbf{dumb}. "by this image of Americans that ya'll have fantized."

Then you try to rationalize why America takes all the credit to make yourself feel better, instead of accepting the real reason why they do. \textbf{Dumb}.So yes, low intelligence, which you have proven once again.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Just Abide Hey. Actually, there was never a single front that the US lost on its own, besides the Pacific theater, but even then, the US reclaimed all territory that Japan gained during its push.

For someone who think's he is smart, he sure doesn't know about this very fact. Also, when Japan officially surrendered, that was when Korea was truly liberated. USSR was only fighting and pushing into the northern parts of Japan-held Korea, but in the end, the US technically did liberate Korea in whole as they were the one who defeated Japan, with some credit to the USSR finally coming into aid in the Allied front of the Pacific Theater.Also, you literally said US lost all battles. Don't deny it. You can say, " But...But... I said US got back up..." but you are still implying that the US lost all its battles, especially on its own. No need to sugar-coat that, we all know you are just petty. And honestly, wow, you do write a lot in paragraphs. Most people wouldn't even bother making their comment this long. Also, crash landing the USSR flag doesn't mean the USSR got to the moon first. Might as well throw a rock at tree and claim it as yours. And did you think, US wanted to kill all the Japanese? No. We only wanted to make them surrender. And USSR was already fighting the Japanese? They were already fighting the Germans, not the Japanese. They did come before the bombings but the US was already pushing back the Japanese, with some help from Allies. And also, I am pretty sure those wars that I mentioned were relevant as you, YOURSELF, said the US lost all battles on its own. Also, if you're really going to say BLITZ said this or BLITZ said that, then why did you even group all Americans together. You obviously knew he had some incorrect facts so why group everyone together and make a BS statement of the US lost ALL of its battles on its OWN? And tell me this, just because you saw a few stupid Americans, does that mean the entire 327 million Americans are stupid? Or is it because of the crap that your TV shows to you? That's quite stereotypical, in which case you are not name-calling, as you have said for yourself (my mistake) but instead you are labeling them into your own little box of what an American is like and looks like. And hey, if you think taking all the credit makes a country look \textbf{dumb}, look at China, they tell their media that they're the ones who took down Japan, not the Americans nor the Allies. But of course, they are only telling this to their own people so they are obviously not \textbf{dumb}, right? Its such a shame, my little one, that someone like you can only make yourself worse. Stereotyping an entire population into one little petty group in your own mind. And by the way, what is the country you have pledged allegiance to? In other words, whats your \textbf{nationality}? I am only curious, after all, there should be reason why you are quick to shove all Americans into a little box and claim they are all \textbf{dumb} and arrogant because of a few or because of your TV shows.

The racists use Trump's name to legitimize their belief but Teump doesn't support the KKK.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Madara Uchiha The Arabs mark May the 15th as a day of remembrance for the catastrophe, the 'Nakba' in Arabic, that befell them with the creation of the State of Israel. They claim the 'indigenous' Arab inhabitants had to flee their 'homeland' as a result. They conveniently fail to mention the reason for the 'catastrophe' and where these supposed indigenous Arab inhabitants actually came from and when.UN General Assembly resolution 181 of 1947 called for the partition of the British Mandate in Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab entities. The Jewish leadership accepted the resolution. The Arabs countries rejected it, which is their right. What they had no right to, was to declare war on the Jewish population in the area.The armies of seven Arab countries set out to destroy the Jewish state, which they outnumbered a hundred to one. They also persecuted the Jewish citizens who lived in their own countries for hundreds of years, forcing them to leave and take refuge in the newly created State of Israel.The Arab nations, together with the Arab population in the British Mandate area, sought to annihilate the Jews in the region and failed. The only catastrophe for them in this scenario was that they lost the war.As in any war, people were uprooted and made to relocate. Nearly a million Jews – who were not even involved in the hostilities – were expelled from Arab countries; and over 600,000 Arabs from Israeli territory, many of whom were actually told to leave by the advancing Arab armies.The 'Mandate for Palestine' by the League of Nations (1922) defined the borders of the homeland of the Jewish people as the area between the Jordan river in the east, to the Mediterranean Sea in the west. This, as explained, due to a long historical and deep religious connection of the Jews to this land. It defined 'Jews' as the people of the land which the San Remo commission (1920) called 'Palestine', using the \textbf{old} Roman title 'Syria-Palestina', given by Caesar Hadrian, in 132 a.d.The Jews brought back the original name of 'Israel' (ישראל) after almost 2000 years. To counter that, the Arabs adopted the Roman term 'Palestine', a word which is has no meaning in Arabic. Although the original founding document of the Palestine Liberation Organization terror group, the 'PLO' said in 1964 (Article 24): 'This Organization does not exercise any territorial sovereignty over the West Bank in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, on the Gaza Strip or in the Himmah Area', the PLO emblem, as well as that of the Hamas, define a 'Palestine' in the same exact borders the League of Nations used for the Land of Israel: from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea.They claimed indigenous status as 'Palestinians' who lived in the area for generations. A review of history though, shows that from the time of the expulsion of the Jews by the Romans, the inhabitants of the area fluctuated.From the time of the conquest of the land by the Muslim Arabs in 636 CE, the rulers of the land constantly shifted between Muslims, Crusaders, Arab Tribes among themselves and even the Mongols. This until 1517, with the Ottoman conquest that brought a measure of relative stability to the country, but also not for long.The waves of conquests and wars; natural calamities such as earth quakes, harsh living conditions; as well as the periodic plundering of Arab Bedouin tribes from the desert, made the area undesirable. There are relatively few elements that can prove continuity of settlement in the Land of Israel whether Jew or Arab.Thus, on the eve of the Zionist settlement, which began with the founding of Petah Tikva in 1878, the country was mostly deserted and abandoned. Its population was sparse and partly nomadic. Famous tourists who visited Israel at the time testified separately to this situation: They found a small rural Bedouin population living in muddy huts and described the place as a marshland, mostly uncultivated terrain, used as a grazing fields for goats and sheep. The local inhabitants were not the owners of the land. The owners were wealthy families from throughout the Ottoman Empire, who had no use for the land beyond the titles and honors it bestowed upon them.With the migration of Jews to the Land of Israel between 1870 and 1947, the Arab population in the area grew by 270, nearly three times that of Egypt, the Arab country with the highest natural birthrate at the time. In other words, the increase was mostly due to migration.The mass immigration was the result of economic development and modernization following Jewish immigration. The Arab immigrants came in search of a livelihood.Tawfiq Bey al-Hourani, the Syrian governor of Hauran, said in 1934 that 'over 30,000 Syrians invaded Palestine within a few months.'Winston Churchill, on May 22, 1939, stated that Arab immigration during the Mandate period to Palestine was so great that their numbers grew by such a rate that even the Jews of the entire world could not match.Franklin Delano Roosevelt, President of the United States, said on May 17, 1939 that the immigration of Arabs to Palestine since 1921 was far greater than the immigration of Jews in recent times.According to the British census in 1931, the Muslims in the country were not necessarily Arabs, judging from the languages they spoke: Afghan, Albanian, Arabic, Bosnian, Circassian, Kurdish, Persian, Sudanese and Turkish.The Arabs themselves admit that Palestinian identity is forged  as seen in the following video: [LINK] It is clear from this that Arabs migrated en masse to the area around the same time as Jews immigrated here. But there is another, very simple way to identify the origins of the Arabs, and that is according to their surnames. In the Arab communities, the surnames identify the tribe, or clans which one belongs to, a country or a region of their roots, and in some cases a profession.It is important to stress that in the tribal culture the loyalty of each individual is first and foremost to their tribe and family. The western concept of \textbf{nationalism} is foreign to the Arabs' tribal cultural. This is one of the reasons that with the fall of the central authority in Arab countries in the past decade, those nations have fallen into disarray.Yasser Arafat's full name for example, is Yasser Yusuf Arafat, Al-Qudwa, Al-Husseini. While he claimed he was born in Jerusalem, he was born in Cairo and his father's family originates from the tribe of Al-Qudwa, which is in Syria. His mother, Husseini, was an Egyptian citizen, though the name exposes her roots in the region between Iraq and Saudi Arabia.Here are some of the origins of \textbf{common} Arabic surnames one can easily find in any phone book in Israel, as well as on the map which reveals their location of origin (Since these names are all in Arabic, some might be spelled differently in other places):Al-Turki – TurkeySultan – TurkeyUthuman  Ottoman – TurkeyAl Masri – EgyptMasrawa – EgyptAl Tartir – Tartir village, EgyptBardawil – Lake and village Bardawil, EgyptTarabin – South-east Sinai (Bedouin), EgyptAbu-Suta  Abu-Seeta – Tarabin tribe, EgyptSha'alan – Bedouin, EgyptFayumi – Al-Fayum village, EgyptAl Bana – EgyptAl-Baghdadi – Baghdad, IraqAbbas – Baghdad, IraqZoabi – West IraqAl-Faruki – IraqAl-Tachriti – IraqZabaide  Zubeidy – IraqHusseini  Hussein – Saudi Arabia (Hussein was the 4th Imam)Tamimi – Saudi ArabiaHejazi – Hejaz region (\textbf{R\textbf{ed}} Sea shoreline) in Saudi ArabiaAl-Kurash  Al Kurashi – Saudi ArabiaTa'amari – Saudi ArabiaAl-Halabi – Haleb region, North SyriaAl-Allawi – West Syria (shoreline)Al-Hurani – Huran District, South SyriaAl-Qudwa – SyriaNashashibi – SyriaKhamati – SyriaLubnani – LebanonSidawi – Sidon, LebanonAl-Surani – Sour-Tair, South LebanonAl-Yamani – YemenAl-Azad – YemenHadadin – YemenMatar – Matar village.

"The single olive pits come from fills [material that accumulated on the surface of the floor before the floor broke apart]. They have no importance whatsoever [for] dating the building. At Megiddo, my dig, samples like this, single items/fills, are not being sent to the lab to be dated, because they enter bias into the dating system," Finkelstein said. "There is no connection whatsoever between the finds at Tel Eton and the biblical description of the United Monarchy."However, whether the United Monarchy actually existed and, if it existed, how large was it, are topics of debate among archaeologists and historians. Fewwritten records have been discovered in Israel that date back to the alleged Monarchy, and some scholars have contended that the surviving archaeological remains indicate that a powerful United Monarchy did not exist. Regarding written records, archaeologists have discovered a 3,200-year-old Egyptian stele written in the name of pharaoh Merneptah that mentions the name"Israel" briefly.Tim Callahan Sceptic Likewise, the description of the Ark of the Covenant closely resembles that of ceremonial barks carried in Egyptian religious processions (p. 54).

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@llNYC  [LINK]   The 1948 Palestinian exodus, also known as the Nakba (Arabic: النكبة‎, al-Nakbah, literally "disaster", "catastrophe", or "cataclysm") occurred when more than 700,000 Palestinian Arabs — about half of prewar Palestine's Arab population — fled or were expelled from their homes, during the 1948 Palestine war. Between 400 and 600 Palestinian villages were sacked during the war, while urban Palestine was almost entirely extinguished.[3The term nakba also refers to the period of war itself and events affecting Palestinians from December 1947 to January 1949.The precise number of refugees, many of whom settled in \textbf{refugee} camps in neighboring states, is a matter of dispute[4] but around 80 percent of the Arab inhabitants of what became Israel (half of the Arab total of Mandatory Palestine) left or were expelled from their homes.[5][6] About 250,000–300,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled before the Israeli Declaration of Independence in May 1948, a fact which was named as a casus belli for the entry of the Arab League into the country, sparking the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.The causes are also a subject of fundamental disagreement between historians. Factors involved in the exodus include Jewish military advances, destruction of Arab villages, psychological warfare, and fears of another massacre by Zionist militias after the Deir Yassin massacre,[7]:239–240 which caused many to leave out of panic; direct expulsion orders by Israeli authorities; the voluntary self-removal of the wealthier classes;[8] collapse in Palestinian leadership and Arab evacuation orders;[9][10] and an unwillingness to live under Jewish control.[11][dubious – discuss][12]Later, a series of laws passed by the first Israeli government prevented Arabs who had left from returning to their homes or claiming their property. They and many of their descendants remain refugees.[13][14] The expulsion of the Palestinians has since been described by some historians as \textbf{ethnic} cleansing,[15][16][17] while others dispute this charge.[18][19][20]The status of the refugees, and in particular whether Israel will grant them their claimed right to return to their homes or be compensated, are key issues in the ongoing Israeli–Palestinian conflict. The events of 1948 are commemorated by Palestinians both in the Palestinian territories and elsewhere on 15 May, a date now known as Nakba Day.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnic, Refugee & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/360 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.556 \\  \hline

I think we got pretty far  from that.. where do you stand?? You had everything, i must say what did British call it? "Soney ki chirhya".. yo had infrastructure, you had coast line you had water, you had rich soil, you have a Huge Land the biggest in asia, you have the biggest Manpower, but my friend You Indians have relatively small Hearts. India spent 70 years hating Us ..why? Because we were \textbf{Nothing} compared to India and yet we were moving forward, and still we are saying again and again that End this nonsense...

We have no reason to compete India.. we are busy making our country dude. Moodi played a very insensitive game. You are educated aren't you?

We are drowned in our own shit that the previous govts has gifted us and we are now cleaning it for the better future. We can't afford a diversion at this moment . You can totally disagree with me it's fine. But War is what we Pakistani don't want and yes like every other sovereign country we can go to war but Pakistan has chosen not to. We Wont. It's a Different perspective aravind... and what do you think? Lets say we pakistan is waek... Ok let's accept but not thay weak that it can't afford a long war... Let's say 3 years.. 3 years will drag Pakistan and India to 1947 . And don't go superman on me and say no that's not gonna happen India this and India that. That's exactly going to go as i described. in the end what will we both countries have? Infrastructure destroyed, manpower exhausted and destroyed, atrocities on both sides,  a destroyed economy, education plundered, mass famine, . Someday maybe we will stop, and look back and we will only see destruction. As one educated person to another.. i must tell you the youth of India should also be ambassadors of peace and harmony.

The largest contributers for the fall of ISIS was by Syrian rebels as well as the Western forces, mostly the US. Russia only put little efforts into exterminating the \textbf{terrorist} group. And the US couldn't defeat the taliban since it keeps using civilians and hides among the populace", making it harder for the US to kill the \textbf{terrorist} group without creatong an oitcry from the muslim populations. The Russians will probably go in and just kill everything in sight if they were to exterminate Taliban faster than the US. What we are doing in Afghanistan may look stupid, but if the Russians were to do the job for us, a lot more innocents would have died since the Russians would have focused on speeding up the war, unlike the US, who tries to avoid killing civilians.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Terrorist & \cellcolor{green!5}Religious Identity - Muslim & \cellcolor{green!5}3/149 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.013 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Dali P  Dali P  You do realize that if 90 of drone strike casualties were really civilians, Obama and Bush would have to resign from Presidentcy. And also, 70-80 of the casualties are terrorists. I don't know where you got your statistics but something like that is just plain stupid. If that many civilians died, Obama and Bush, as well as Trump, would have had to resign Presidency. And now you are moving to who supported who? Sure, the US supports Saudi Arabia, who as of now makes a lot of wrong doings yet they are trying to reform. Yet look at Syria and Iran, who Russia supports. Syria uses chemical weapons on their own people and Iran has a more stricter regime than Saudi Arabia. Plus, of all middle eastern countries, they are probably most likely to trigger a nuclear fallout. And due to this, Israel is ramping up its nuclear defenses. And remember when Russia contributed to a genocide that were even larger than the holocaust. Not only that, they now use flamethrowers to clear bunkers. So think about this, terrorists use civilians as human shields, and when both are in a bunker, guess what? Pop comes out the Russian and burns the two people to crisps. Although I don't care what happens to the terrorists in its matter of how it dies, the civilian will get killed just the same as the \textbf{terrorist}. You can say that 20-30 of civilians still died from US strikes, but Russia is still worse. And compared to all the countries the US supported, Russia supports some that are far worse. And guess what, during ww1 and ww2, it is still true that the entrance of the US was a big contributer of changing the tides of war. Sure, Stalingrad was important but when the US entered, the Allies were able to push back the Nazis back more easily. And also, if you think the US didn't contribute any during the two world wars, then why do you even bother to complain. Russia does it as well, and maybe all the other Allie members as well. Everyone contributed, except each country has its own sense of patriotism therefore they will tell thier children that they did the most work. And its not our fault Russia sent all those unprepared troops at once during both wars. Heck, the US still played a key role as it supplied loads of equipment and ships to the Allies before it entered. And the US was the spear head in the Pacific theatre, where the Japanese presented a large threat to individual democracy to the asian continent, although nost of the asian countries were changed into communism right after their liberation.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Terrorist & \cellcolor{green!27}Religious Identity - Muslim & \cellcolor{green!27}1/454 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.22 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@andrew leeI am German and belive me, it's mandatory in our country to learn about ww1 and ww2, since the back then governments were responsible for them. In 1944 the fall of Berlin was just a matter of time and not the question whether win or lose.. The only reason us troops landed in France was to stop the soviet army as early as possible. The strong resistance of the remaining german troops forced the western allies to bomb the shit out of almost every big city, to break the resistance as fast as possible, even at the price of hundreds of thousands civil casualties. The first reason was the fear that the soviets might take over whole Europe and isolate GB. The second reason was the fear of loosing all the efforts in science and mechanics developed by Germany during the war to the soviets. It was just a side effect that western Germany developed so good after the war, it was a prestige project to show the whole world that capitalism is the better system. Its was one country divided in the western capitalist part and the eastern \textbf{communist} part. So the us pumped billions of dollar in western Germany to show the whole world that the capitalism is the superior system. Since that day we lost our sovereignty and were forced into the could war. And again after the soviets lost 28 million people in this horrific war, Germany was dragged in a conflict against Russia. Everything this sick basterd hilter dreamed of was achieved by the USA. This country was biuld on blood and bones. Beginning with the genocide on the indigenous people of America and then continued by the slavery of the \textbf{black} people, justified by the \textbf{old} testament. So don't you dare to speak about genocide and protecting the USA in the same time! In 2003 the us invaded Iraq and killed estimated 150k to 1.5 million people in this war, that evidently based on a lie spread by the Bush government. Human rights watch is the source in case of all drone casualties. And did something happend to bush or Obama? All of them are considered patriots and heroes. Libya was crushed in 2011 by Obama under the pressure from Hillary Clinton. Once it was the richest country in Africa, now its the main checkpoint for refugees heading to Europe. Isil is spreading across Libya and from there it will spread further to other \textbf{african} muslim countries suffering poverty, the best base for extrimism. The us supported Saddam Hussein with all kinds of weaponry, including chemical weapons, against iran im the 1970s. And today again, almost 30 years after the sovijetunion collapsed, the USA is dragging Europe in a war with Russia, using the Ukraine as a proxy.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@America by pop up William Blair Im glad i never have, and i agree, in war there is no winners only, the only good thing that come from war is two things, which both world wars are evidence of, 1: We have this \textbf{weird} ability to make leaps in technological advances in both warfare and tech in general, which mostly is what all consumer products are based from or even found civilian usage for it. So innovation comes from our desperate need to find better ways or more scare ways to kill each other, that kind of tells a clear picture of us as a species. The optimistic side is that we often find peacuful usage for such tech in peace times. Second good thing, is both that medical science and knowledge is like tech something that takes leaps in progress during war, which will be gainful for us after(if we "humans" survive them), for an example penicillin was one of those huge discoveries during wartime. And what was the best thing after WW2, that most humans nvever wanted war to haöpen again on thar scale, and so far we have managed to duck most of those small incidents that start huge wars (aka assasins on monarchs and \textbf{crazy} mustache maffias taking germany hostage). But my feeling is, we are heading to some big problrms that tend to end in war, i. e global warming, food shortage, fight for the last resorces, i would guess Russia, China, North Korea will start a axis alliance, against Europe/USA/Canada/Japan. India and Pakistan will form an alliance with Iraq, Iran, Egypt, and Marocco, and they are propably content and will be happy if they manage for once defeat Israel?\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Crazy, Weird & \cellcolor{green!27}Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}2/285 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.702 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Rod13 why has there been Palestinian people in \textbf{refugee} camps in surrounding countries for the last four decades? The international aid that Palestine receives from the \textbf{R\textbf{ed}} Cross and others is in the hundreds of millions of dollars,with this money you would think that they would have the opportunity to stabilise their infrastructure,hospitals,and the money would get used correctly,do you realise that Palestinians have blown the whistle on major corruption within their political parties and the international aid,there are two sides to a story and then you have to evaluate the truth within the two sides, ISRAEL with out doubt has shown aggression towards the Palestinians,but the reason why is that they have been the longest persecuted peoples still living on this planet 🌍 and now that they have grown stronger together by sticking with each other shows that they will never let this happen ever again by the help of the LORD. The university's around the world show the different empires that ruled through civilisation,and the chosen \textbf{race} the \textbf{nation} of ISRAEL has been acknowledged by the three Abrahamic faiths and historically has always been in that part of the world. There are jews from all over the globe and with technology today you're DNA is 99 accurate in regards to your \textbf{nationality},people will criticise this comment saying that the Jews own and control everything which is not true,six billion people on this planet,a billion in India and another billion in China,so Asia has a third of the worlds population according to the statistics,jews are returning back to ISRAEL ( aliyah) and there neighbors don't want a democratic country sitting in the Middle East that pushes a agenda that is against their beliefs,I understand that but however they also acknowledge that ISRAEL pre existed Christianity and Islam by three thousand years in that part of the world 🌍. The problem is propaganda getting fed to the West doesn't help,like I said there are people in power living very comfortable in this region and as long as Palestinians are oppressed the money will continue to keep coming in,don't you question why three generations of one people are still in camps and \textbf{nothing} has changed and yes there have been people that have came out whistleblowers and put their life and families lives in danger and if they were exposed you know they would be charged with treason. I belong to this beautiful place and I'm not a religious person but there is a lot of history in ISRAEL and is a centre piece of all the men of GOD,and today many Jews are returning for this same reason to identify themselves in this world 🌍 you should read the history of the place and the people who walked the land,I believe in all honesty people are either envious that a little country like ISRAEL defeated their neighbors while being attacked from all directions or they have invested into the far left ideology imo 🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nation, Nationality, Nothing, Race, Red, Refugee & \cellcolor{green!5} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - General, Ethnicity - Native-American, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}7/494 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.417 \\  \hline

It's core values where from Classical Judaism and Classical Christianity. All three religions were sent by god. But unfortunately White people changed and currupted text, misguided the people from the synagogues and churches.  This is why God sent a final revolution in the Holy \textbf{Quran} - because the Torah and Bible was currupted by white people. If your one of those warmongering religious fanatic who believes in murder, bombing, looting of Palestinian land, then your basically a currupted Jewish-Zionist/Christian/Wahab-Islamic person.Too much Fox news is not good for you.

Second of all, I'm Asian and white supremacy never even corrupted Christianity, only secular desires used it to justify secular objectives. The same can be said about islam. For example, ISIS uses islam to justify their actions but yet they only have secular interests, power. If you really think fox is that bad, then you haven't seen the wntire main stream media in America, which is either just as bad or worse. For example, buzzfeed, MTV, CNN and MSNBC. And when did christianity or even this white supremacy of yours ever say bombing and looting people were ever good? That was not in the bible nor any code of white supremacy. That is called the human being. Humans will want to destroy each other and take things from each other. The crap you're doing right now is an example of stereotyping. You're making it seem like islam and maybe even the arabics are better than the christians or even the white people, which proves that arabic supremacy is just as bad as white supremacy. White supremacy means that the white people are the superior \textbf{race}, which is not true as each \textbf{race} is good at its own thing. However, what you are saying is that you are putting islam and possibly arabic races above all else, especially white people or christians and jews, which is just bad. No human being is perfect, whether you are European desceny or Arabic descent or whatever you are. So is Christianity. Even the bible confirms that no christians can be perfect as they are still a sinful human. And if Islam truly believes in the same God as Christianity, then even the muslims are imperfect. So is the jews. Sure, the atrocities against the Palestinians are bad, but the jews had to go through something worse, and christianity had suffered for longer than jews or the palestinians. And even if Israel never killed Palestinians, the entire middle east would have still been at their throats for being jewish.

And by the way, its the SJW who considered it ok to stereotype all white people as \textbf{racist}, even though the white people were the ones who helped them gain freedom from slavery. Not only that, it's the SJW who hold anti-American beliefs, putting other nationalities before America. Even though it is ok to respect other nationalities, it is not ok to prioritize them. It was also the SJW who called Trump supporters \textbf{racist} and fascist, even though most of them were not. And it is the sjw who support globalism and its open border policy, which can make it more easier for terrorists of all background to cross to any desired targets. It is the SJW who call all those who go against their beliefs as \textbf{racist}, sexist, \textbf{homophobic}, and a fascist, even if the accused are not a \textbf{racist}, sexist, \textbf{homophobic}, and/or fascist. And its the SJW who think AR 15s are weapons of mass destruction and deny the fact that guns can protect households. Not only that, the SJW blamed good American citizens who own guns for the mass shootings as well as chridtians for the nazis and the kkk but claimed that islamic terrorism has \textbf{nothing} to do with islam. And besides if you really think that Christianity is the real scourge of humanity, then think again. Look at atheism, which was basic ideology of the Soviet Union that led them to kill millions of religious people, aside of some asian religions. This does not mean that all atheists are bad, but it only means your point is invalid. Not only that, it is the SJWs who advocate for socialism, which is only good for a limited topics, but not at the scale that the sjws advocate for. If you think christianity is destroying society, then that would only mean the SJWs were already destroying it in the first place. And don't even say about social justice back then because that has \textbf{nothing} to do with the chaotic thing called the SJWs we have today.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender, Homophobic, Nothing, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General, Sexual Identity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}9/493 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.826 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@hIstory buff Now that I am thinking about it, you will probably complain the comment was too long, so let me summarize it for you. Christianity was never a threat to America; however, the SJWs are the clear threat as its feminists try to create \textbf{gender} inequality against men, its ANTIFA attacking everything around them and calling it a fight against the so called fascism, some of its \textbf{black} protestors justifying stereotyping white people, and that it is anti-patriotic in the form of desecrating the US flag and the statue of liberty.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Gender & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/92 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.174 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@hIstory buff In addition to that, atheism had presented a greater threat than chrisitanity in a span of few decades compared to the Spanish Catholic inquisition that was prolonged over several centuries (this does not mean athiests are bad people). And I forgot to mention, the taliban is an Islamic political movement which uses \textbf{terrorist} tactics but is not really a \textbf{terrorist} group as compared to ISIS and Al Qaeda, although they are all bad and an enemy to the US. That said, SJWs are more of a threat than your self created \textbf{mental} image of Christianity.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Mental, Terrorist & \cellcolor{green!5}Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments, Religious Identity - Muslim & \cellcolor{green!5}3/97 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.093 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@andrew lee What a load of deranged codswallop!  A study from 2015 basically stated that the arrival of Europeans killed 56 million people in the America's (The role of CO2 decline for the onset of Northern Hemisphere glaciation, Quaternary Science Reviews Volume 119, 1 July 2015, Pages 22-34,  [LINK]  .  The cultural power that unleashed such a holocaust on the first \textbf{nation} peoples of the america's was the catholic church.  That's 56 million dead caused by a culture (white European) lead by the church.  ISIS, Al Qada and the Taliban together have never come close to killing 56 million people.  The Christians are the real terrorists of this world, a terror that has been going on for 2000 years.  Also, when was the last time atheists killed that many people?  Dude your delusional if you think atheists are a danger to anyone.  The Christian Taliabn are the real terrorists in US society.  Last year 2000 people were killed by right wing extremists.  \textbf{Zero} people were killed by SJW atheists.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nation, Zero & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/168 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.19 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@hIstory buff Yet the Europeans who came here who actually killed all those natives were those who seeked power and wealth which were all secular objectives. They only had missionaries with them so that the catholic church to back up their voyages. Even if atheism created ways to reduce CO2 emmisions, but that is only in the matter of secular science. I am talking about a secular government who killed people with different religious or political beliefs. Sure, the muslims never killed that many, including all the killings due to secular goals, we would have never known since they never reached main land Europe nor created boats made for voyages. And like I said, Stalin was an athiest who wanted a secular government controlling a secular society in which \textbf{nothing} can be place above him or the government. And another thing, you are the exact proof of why SJWs are destroying society TO THIS DAY. Not yesterday nor 2 millenniums ago, but today. You base lie to yourselves and everyone by saying that the white supremacists or the neonazis are evil for saying that all muslims are terrorists because of the actions of the few, yet you claim all christians are evil to those who killed for secular objectives, but only used the church to back them up. And destruction of society does not always require death. It could also include the degradation of morality, logic, and culture. And for the most part, this was done by the SJW to sooth their hurt feelings. And what these so-called  christians did back then was only of the past and is not happening in the present. This still is an atrocity, but the killings were mostly at the fault of sickness. And the last time I checked, diseases didn't have any religious affiliations nor seeked one out to fund their conquest. But on the other hand, the SJWs never killed anybody, but did somethung that is the true threat to the American Society, threaten to assassinate the US president and as well as anyone who sided with him. And these killings by the "right" were done by the extreme alt-right, not people with conservative beliefs, but by people of the actual alt-right. The left on the other hand only escalated the tension, not only blaming this on the real alt-right, but as well as people who do not have alt right values, but only labeled as one by the left, and people with only moderate right wing values. Even if SJWs never killed anyone, they are still doing harm to society either way. And like I said, the taliban is a political group that uses \textbf{terrorist} tactics. But also, there was never any fully dedicated and organized christian \textbf{terrorist} group, neonazis and kkk are only white supremacists and not christian \textbf{terrorist} groups, in America.

He was wise to the Rothschilds Plan to install a Central Banking System to control the Value of every currency of every \textbf{Nation}. His resistance to these plans sealed his fate and the fate of his family as they were murdered.  there are videos here on youtube that actually show these evil Bankers visiting Russia and planning and moving their people into position to takeover the seats of power and when they moved in not a single shot was needed to be fired.    a few years earlier,in 1910 there was a secret meeting and this meeting and plan are detailed in the book  'The Creature from Jekyll Island' The main idea behind this book is a fairly simple one: the Federal Reserve Bank is a serious problem for the wellbeing of the American citizens. It was created at a secret meeting on Jekyll Island in 1910 by the richest people of that \textbf{age}. And its only objective is to keep the money away from the normal people and in the richest pockets for all times. After President Woodrow Wilson was threatened into signing these Banksters 100 year agreement with the US Government to be in control of valuation and loaning of the US Dollar to the US Government at 10 interest he was depressed and demoralized and said he had just agreed to Enslave future generations of the unborn citizens of the United States. we all must realize that these same Bankers are trying to rewrite Historical Facts as found on the internet just as they have sought to control the very schools and curriculum taught in many schools across the land. The Rothschilds have hired many thousands of internet spies and commenters to ridicule anyone that exposes the truth of their manipulations of historic fact and are on chat rooms, forums, and youtube etc. These same Bankers Families Founded Israel and have manipulated many Nations into War and are responsible for the Deaths of Millions of people. After learning about the fate of the USS Liberty and the loss of 58 US Navy Sailors I realized that those people are not to be trusted and they should be able to defend their own territory as they brag so much on the internet and then mention that some \textbf{black} dude should sodomise us for waking up to the fact that they are stupid and that the people of the USA have realized what a buncha losers they really are. enjoy your iron dome and the cupcakes your friends in Russia,China and Iran will be sending you very soon.

Where is the Rockfeller family in that manifesto you've just wrote? Or Du Pont? Or Morgan? I mean you CAN blame the jews, again, for everything but that just makes you a \textbf{racist}, observing and criticising a certain group of people for an action done by a lot more of that said \textbf{ethnic} group of people.If you gonna attack the jews for rulling the world, atleast gather all of the needed information.The USS liberty is kind of a false flag operation, Im pretty sure that you know the definition of that and yoy gotta ask yourself something very simple, your answer to yourslef will astound you, ready? Here we go.If the false flag we conducted by Israel on Americans to make the American - Egyptian relations to crumble, you will condemn it, right? Good.Now, if your government did something similar to your country lets say i dont know knocking out 2 towers in a way only engineered and controlled explosion could make it collapse into itself just so the people will support lets say the biggest manhunt in man kind causing death of Americans who were sent to that said country of terroist in order to liberate it but actually all the U.S did was to pump oil.Or financing a candidate that will cause an entire country to split because of that, or violating democracy to stay in that country.If you choose to go with a name like rothschild and trying to spill the light over the name and so called \textbf{race} behind the conspiracy, at least don't be \textbf{dumb} fuck and discuss everything even if it doesnt match your bullshit patriot agenda.Today whoever controls the media got everyone bashed up, wether its Israel, POTUS, calling alt right nazis althougj the nazis was a left wing party.You see, when you start talking about the truth and the back story, tell everything so you wont come out as a \textbf{racist} \textbf{r\textbf{edneck}}.War funding had been going on for years by EVERY ELITE FAMILY in the world.Just like the Rothschilds, Rockfeller and du pont lets say, have an unlimited supply of resources and money, they control the media and everything you say and thonk is being programmed to you.People are not born to hate, people are not born with a bias prejudice thinking, it's being planted in their minds and remember, if someone wants you to have prejudice for other people, it's because they gain something from it, you on the other hand will sit on the wall after everything will be exposed and realise how wrong you were and that you have to betray the so called beliefs you have.The CIA killed Israeli diplomats, The CIA gave weapons to arabs countries to provoke israel thus systematically causing the Middle East to be a barrel of gasoline ready to be blown up.Or in the case of thw U.S, a barrel of oil ready to be sucked and stored waiting for the oil shortage to erupt.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Dumb, Ethnic, Race, Racist, Redneck & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General, Ethnicity - White, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}7/568 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.232 \\  \hline

I was born in Lebanon, and couldn't go to my hometown because of the Israeli occupation in the south of Lebanon. There were no terrorists , there was an invasion and the people had the right to form a resistance . So again , if you don't know the whole truth then say I don't know , lot of families were killed , lot of moms lost their children and of kids lost their parents back then , and you saying this is very cruel and ignorant . If Israel finished their goal like you said back then , they wouldn't try to enter again brother , you get what I mean ? They tried again in 2006 with their advanced planes and failed , and they killed lots of civilians in the process to put the pressure on the resistance to surrender their weapons and give up the war .

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@sami hirsh didn't see your comments there but now I have . USA funded Al Taliban , which turned into Al Ka3ida as you said which turned into ISIS . You know half the story , ISIS wasn't created alone with advanced production and cameras and so on . Even having them executing American journalists was all staged since there was no fear and not even close to enough amount of blood while beheading . That said , lot of Jews who live in USA are against Israel and what they got of agenda , you just see the media controlled by your own government and you have to agree that media is the biggest weapon of war these days . I'm not a politician but when you are born and raised in warzones , witnessing wars with your own eyes and wondering why the hell is the world sitting their asses down and not doing anything to stop the killings and oppression. Then you come to see that they are actually in it really deep , and for what , the survival of Israel, no matter how much it takes , they will protect Israel by helping them kill the Palestinians, and this is the biggest issue with Israelites, they want more land , which explains why they were in the Lebanese south . Somewhere around 1917 , Britain took the call and gave the jews someone else's home , Palestine, after the jews were killed , burned and prosecuted, they needed a new home to stay , even if they were the poorest people on earth , \textbf{nobody} has that right to give somebody else's land , Britain didn't have that right . All the time , Christians and Muslims lived without discrimination in Palestine, until Britain gave the Zionist jews Palestine which made the Palestinians retaliate after seeing that they are being kicked out of their own land , lured into the inside to be cornered with big media and world coverage . So the Lebanese resistance is taking this cause upon itself to save and liberate Palestine which will happen in the future. So I'm gonna ask you this question and I want you to be honest in answering and very relevant . What right did Britain have to give someone else's home to the jews? Second , why does USA cover everything up , from funding the terrorists , to media coverage on Palestine which they know how it all began , and is it right just because having a \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} carpet like Saudi Arabia for their own interests they must cover up their terror against Yemen and the region in the middle east ?

And noting that we don't take the \textbf{old} testament anymore since the church teaches us that Jesus came to relieve us from the \textbf{old} testament , now you want to take this into account that the land is theirs ? What about that God isn't a man nor the son of man , what about the porn , what about the creation errors ? Either let the \textbf{old} testament go as a whole or take it all . The British can confirm and they admit that they gave Palestine to the jews and then made it biblical. Why do you think they manipulated the \textbf{old} testament ?

They claimed that the merkava can't be destroyed for it's anti rocket system , when it got destroyed , Europe canceled their deals buying it . And actually Lebanon lost more than 1000 casualties , 99 of them are civilians . It was a massacre so it's ignorant to speak of such monstrosity if you got no actual knowledge.

That's why these counties are fought , they are the only ones carrying the cause to liberate Palestine from the genocide. In Lebanon back in 2006 when the Israeli attacked Lebanon  , they only bombed and attacked Shia Muslim areas in the south , this is why I only included the Lebanese resistance, and not the whole of Lebanon, the plan was always against the Shia Muslim countries for they are the only ones following that cause , and the areas that were occupied by Israel in Lebanon were in the south for the majority are Shia and I'm from a village where Shia and Christians live together .\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Common, Nation, Terrorist & \cellcolor{green!27}Nationality - General, Religious Identity - Muslim, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}3/229 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.31 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@starwarsrebel2006 yes 1967. Never forget... lol. It was not like they succeeded at invasion or even took a piece of land. It was more of  them trying to take some province but not being able to but still defeating the \textbf{Indian} army. Many believe that it was because India had just fought and won a war with Pakistan and as they sat down to enjoy their victory, the Chinese had attacked. It was an intense situation and there was no budget left for funding the military to fight there. No supplies either. It was such a tragedy that the Prime Minister himself had to beg the citizens to fund them, over radio and speeches. One of the very rich Nawabs heard him over the radio and called him to his mansion. Then he literally opened his entire treasury for the funding. He gave some tons of gold off in boxes that the PM carried back in his planes. That was a great deed. But at last, the victory was in the expected hands. Some say that after the war,  less than a decade later, \textbf{Indian} army took revenge which is technically true. There was another attempt by Chinese to invade but then \textbf{Indian} army killed hundreds of their soldiers instead.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Indian & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Native-American & \cellcolor{green!5}3/210 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.429 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small alister moore Battles are fought in the air, above and beneath the water, but wars can only be won on the ground. If nukes are not counted, Chinese have the strongest defensive force in the world. Not to mention that the number of all warships in the world is not even close to the 1/20 of DF missiles they have... This means even America doesn't have the ability to deliver military aircrafts to as close as 2000km away from the Chinese coasts. Yes Mig21s are still in service in China, but the majority are J-10 and J-11(Su27), and they have the ability to mass produce J15s and J-20s if there is urgent need. At full capacity, the estimated rate of production can be at least 70 per month. Chinese armor forces are only second to Russian's. According to newest estimation, Chinese APFSDS shells can penetrate 400mm/60° RHA steel at 2000m, more than enough to penetrate any MBT's front armor. With the impossibility to deliver aircraft and accompanied lack of air supremacy, landing from the coast against countless missiles, anti-tank cannons, MBTs,  is nearly impossible. While during 1980s China army also developed a series of primitive yet effective tactics against tank floods with only troops, which were conducted successfully during the boarder conflicts with Soviet Russia. Each Chinese infantry squad is equipped with at least 3 RPGs, with penetration of over 600mm armor, being able to destroy any tank on the side or rear. And the number of active soldiers in army alone is 2 million. India can try to invade China, but Himalaya will stall the transportation severely, and further pushing into the inner land has been proven impossible. The barrier is mutual, but since we're taking about the defending ability, there is no need to talk about the possibility of China invading India for now. Admittedly, there are a lot of outdated equipments in the Chinese military forces, but most of them are for training uses, since there is no solid threat near China for now. Many of you just ignorantly neglected the fact that China is currently the largest industrial country, with competent technology and productivity. It may not have the ability to control overseas territories, but defending itself is just too easy for it. Also, 80 modern Chinese military developments were accomplished in the past 20 years, after the the Cold War, meaning that it's reasonable of you all to make incorrect or incomplete conclusions out of context. Not to mention that during the Korean War, China has already shown its strength and potential of war with laggard technologies against the nato forces. All countries are possible to invade, just the price varies. Casualties resulted from invasion to China may not be acceptable. All these statements are still in a nuclear-free context. Instead of total destruction, China is still able to eliminate all major cities on the west coast of US. China is also at the leading position in the development of hypersonic weapons, which remain maneuverable and untraceable when reentering the atmosphere at more than 5Mach. Missile interception will be nearly impossible against Chinese ICBMs and the effective target range will be extended by a factor of at lowest 5 with the new warheads. Plus there is currently no cost effective reason to invade China, it remains safe as a \textbf{nation} from outside threats, as safe as America and Russia. \textbf{Nothing} can be more scary to potential invaders than the risk of being wiped out from the map by nukes.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nation, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/584 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.342 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small history tells us a differnt story.. form "coming into your country and telling You to split".. i will just keep it like this.. back at the early 19th century Jews did came Isarel (known as Palastine back then) those jews came form religues reasons.. and it was called the "\textbf{old} Velige" those jews didnt aim to create a country.. or Anything like that.. They just lived there like anyone else.. Just like the arabs.. that place to remind you belonged to Otteman empire , now as Jewdisem became a nantointly.. on the baces of \textbf{common} history lengugch and Culture ( the actual Relgion became a culture..) there were a new type of Arrivels they were called the New Velige.. They aimed to create a country..the lands Jews settled on Were Brought form those same arabs.. or were given by the ottemans..those same jews over the years under otteman Crual region at ww1 and Under the brittish White book the Jews of the New Veliege also known as The Jewish Settleman Created an Econimc Political Powerhouse , they had an army , they had baiscly everything But the world  Regection.. in the same time the arabins were effected by the jews and So the revliey beetwen them (it was and it grown deeper to what it is now..) Palastain country.. didnt exist Back then that place belong to ottems then bartish and Then Arabs Refused to take that same offer.. After the 47-48 war They Name changed To palastains To relete to the land , they werent ready to be a country hench why the sosity there collopsed so Eazly.. and in a inscene they baiscly all runned a way (the refuge problom comes form here..) meaning The statement that says "its the palastain country"its wrong.. Cuz jews brought that land form palastains , jews were given land by the ottemans and idea of a country to the arabs didnt Came untill like the 1925.. and arabiens were offered a country by the U.N at 1947 and they refused. So we are looking here in a legit country that wasnt created by illegel Means , they didnt killed arabs Before the war (we all know war means people die at both side..) So what do we have now? This very debate beetwen the two sides.. Arabs Were offered a country 5 times by now , refused , the Only way palastains will Have a country of thier very own will Be that Hamas and Palastain govrment will stop fighting and Start negosting with the isarels and Accpeting Terms.. isareliens dont want 2.5m palastains In thier Country , they hate gaza being a \textbf{spike} they cant remove without mistakingly killing 400k innoncent  people with a single air raid You cant kill a country that has a nucler power , a start-up country and One of the highest tec-places with high siber-rearch on earth , that simply wont happend .The only passable country that will be is that the palastains Will be country like scoutland or One of the many states in the usa that has No army an independence laws And comman Coin it isarel aswell as a deal with isarel regeding water and enregy supply and Defance pact that Make it so that either defend the rest and Help stop \textbf{terrorist} and ofc will have its own voice in the U.N Regeding Jerslium , thats a tale for another story .. and btw.. its allready freaking sperted by a 20 foot wall in the middle of the city as if its bralien of the cold war all over again\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Common, Old, Spike, Terrorist & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Religious Identity - Muslim, Religious Identity - Protestant, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}4/600 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.667 \\  \hline

After Musaa peace be upon him, Bani-israel lost their way, so they were scattered across the Earth by Allah's will. Allah sent Jesus Christ peace be upon him as a prophet to the group of Bani-israel that were in Palestine at the time, they betrayed him by false claim that Jesus was against the Roman emperor.

Israhell has invested heavily in Chinese manufacturing and then forces US companies to open shop in China. Israhells plan is to crush America while making China the new Worlds Suoer Power, all for Jew profits!China and Israel Eric S. Margolis The first-ever visit by a Chinese head of state to Israel seemed at first glance rather curious. China, a longtime political and military supporter of the Arabs and Iran, used to denounce Israel as a 'running dog of US imperialism' and 'a racist-fascist state?' So what was President Jiang Zemin doing hobnobbing in Israel? Jiang had two objectives: a. deepen the secret 20-year military relationship between China and Israel; b. by openly befriending Israel, counteract growing anti-Chinese feeling in Congress that threatens both China's exports to the US, and its admission to the World Trade Organization. . . The normally pro-Israeli Clinton Administration, however, is not pleased. William Cohen, the US Secretary of Defense, recently unleashed an unprecedented public blast at Israel for selling advanced military technology to China that could threaten American forces in the event of a clash with China over Taiwan. Cohen demanded Israel cancel the US \$1-2 billion sale of 3-5 AWACS airborne radar aircraft to China. Israel refused, though it may only sell China one of the Russian aircraft equipped with an Israeli 'Phalcon' advanced radar/electronic warfare system, developed from the US 'Hawkeye' AWACS system, at least until the heat subsides. Former CIA Director James Woolsey testified Israel has covertly sold 'several billions' of dollars worth of top-secret US technology to China since 1983. The Inspector General of the US State Department found, in a 1992 report, a 'systematic and growing pattern' of Israel selling American military technology in direct violation of US law. That report concluded Israel was supplying arms based on restricted American technology to China, Chile, Ethiopia, and South Africa, all of whom then under US arms embargo. The Pentagon has claimed since the mid-1980's that Israel simply copies or reverse \textbf{engineers} secret US defense technology and then exports it even on occasion, it is whispered, to Russia. Until now, Israel's influential friends on Capital Hill managed to downplay or cover up these serious charges. The transfer of billions worth of advanced US military technology to Israel, under the innocuous title of 'Technical Data Packages,' was arranged by Israel's American supporters, beginning in 1970. This massive infusion of secret US weapons and electronics technology the largest ever to another \textbf{nation}  allowed Israel to develop state-of-the art military industries that exported some \$1.5-2 billion annually (40 of its total exports by the late 1980's), and which became the \textbf{nation}'s largest employer. Israel is now the world's sixth largest arms exporter. In some cases, Israel improved on US weapons and electronics systems. Pentagon sources charge Israel 'backdoored' US technology to China for the Patriot AA missile, other surface-to-air missiles; the PL-8 air-to-air missiles; C-802 anti-ship missiles; advanced composite tank armor and tank guns; aircraft avionics and ground radar systems; and the J-10 fighter, which is based on secret US technology used in Israel's cancelled 'Lavi' fighter. Israel denies these charges. A Pentagon investigation of the Patriot sale, cleared Israel. Critics charged it did so under intense political pressure from Israel's supporters. Israel insists its high-tech arms exports are all 100 of Israeli origin. But American defense claim the Israelis often only make minor modifications to basic US-supplied technology and weapons, then sell them clandestinely. Israeli intelligence agents are known to have targeted specific advanced US defense technology. Israel has also sold considerable quantities of arms, electronics, and US technology to Taiwan, including a reverse-engineered US Lance missile, and anti-ship missiles. Singapore is another major recipient of Israeli arms and discreetly co-produces weapons with Israel. Israel has become a major military supplier to India, including nuclear weapons and missile technology. Ironically, some of Israel's arms and technology sales have returned to haunt the Jewish state. This columnist learned in 1994 that nuclear technology Israel had bartered for enriched uranium to South Africa, was resold by South Africa to Iraq in exchange for oil. Iraq's infant nuclear program, designed as a counter-force to Israel's nuclear arms, thus originated, in part, from Israel. Missile technology sold by Israel to China found its way into tactical missiles sold by China to Iran, Syria, and Iraq, and, reportedly, into CSS-2 ballistic missiles sold by China to Saudi Arabia. American defense and state department officials are furious at Israel for so flagrantly violating the US embargo of high-tech arms to China, particularly as tensions between Washington and Beijing rise. There have even been angry demands in Congress for the value of the Israeli AWACS aircraft sold to China to be deducted from the \$3-5 billion in aid Israel receives annually from the US. Fears are being expressed that US technology for Israel's new 'Arrow' anti-missile system, developed with nearly \$1 billion in US aid, may also be sold to China. Israelis claim their weapons sales to China motivate Beijing to keep a leash on its ally, North Korea, which, says Israelis, ships missiles to Iran and the Arabs. Russia remains China's main arms supplier. Sales by Israel keep Russia and China apart, say Israeli partisans. Nonsense, retorts the Pentagon.

If 1,000,000 that dont know how to use guns start shooting them off randomly, they will end up killing more people than 1,000,000 trained people. Being trained makes you more effective, but everyone knows (or maybe not cuz we have had some peaceful times) that a wild beast is more dangerous than a trained animal, mainly because of the unotedictability. And in a war, when faced with unpredictability,  you are gonna end up losing a lot. People with guns that don't know how and when to use it, will use it everywhere. A trained soldier will try to conserve ammo and think logically. So yes \textbf{crazy} American that spend all day every day of their free time practicing shots would go ham on invading soldiers.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Gregory Smith Stop being an ass. If he wants to be rude that's his problem, I'm sorry if he doesn't understand what hes saying, but dont stoop to his level. Suicide is a \textbf{crazy} major problem in every country in the world and guess what. It is a major problem in the \textbf{age} groups of 14-28 in every country including OURS. Dont try to shame someone when you dont know their situation. This guy is probably laughing at those kids that decide to kill themselves with you. Dont involve them. It's not right for them to do that, but stress is real bro, and it manifests itself in everybody. So yes people might kill themselves because they couldn't get into school, but that sounds more like the last straw and not the only reason. People like to use excuses when suiciding  because they think no one can understand their situation or accept them, so they see no point in explaining it. I think some stereotype like heart-break is the dumbest reason to kill oneself, theres at least 7,000,000,000 other people, out of which at least 1,000,000 qualify in terms of appropriate \textbf{gender} and \textbf{age} and looks, and at least 1,000,000 qualify in terms of location. So if you have that many options why get sad when you lose one? I think it's the same with the schools. Kids dont kill themselves becuase they didnt get into a school. They kills themselves because they DONT SEE any option left. I'm going on and on but I am investing my time in you because I believe you can and will be the bigger man.

Computers and A.I. were developed because of the American Military trying to calculate every single possiblity in every single second, in essence trying to create a super calculator, which became modern day computers. Honestly if someone wanted to invade a country, and I feel like this is really the first way ANY country would attack their enemy in the modern day, they would do it the easy way which is first take over the power supply. Then send \textbf{crazy} amounts of electricity through the lines, effectively electrocuting anyone or anything  close or in contact ( because yes electricity can travel through air, especially if there enough charge [Lightning]) and simultaneously causing fires in the whole country. Then you send a virus or packet over wifi or whatever frequency that would make people's batteries do the same thing and over charge, potentially causing all these electronics to explode.

Fortress Europe was believed to be impregnable, yet the Allied Forces broke through its defenses on D-Day despite the huge number of casualties.l Terrain is not impossible to overcome. It is benefit as well as a hindrance to the defending force because that rugged terrain also slows supply lines and reinforcements while making airstrikes against those targets more easy. The S would dominate the skies of Iran with or without allied forces. Stating Iran has not been invaded since WWII is meaningless. Germany, Russia, France, and many other countries haven't been invaded since WWII either. Also, when it comes to Iran's military force it would weaken upon a large scale invasion and there are signifcant portions of the populace that would resist the Iranian government and aid the invading force so long as that force appeared benevolent enough for them.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@lmprdks1 What do you define as being a relative \textbf{age} for an empire?  The Egyptian Empire was not destroyed due to the diverse people within its realm, which included the Veddoids who existed in what is now called the middle east whose population spanned all the way to what is now known as Afghanistan and the Dravidians whose people populated what is now called Pakistan and into southern tip of India. The Egyptians even traveled West covering Northern Africa. These peoples were destroyed by Barbarians from the frozen tundra of the North. These early European exterminated the Veddoids in Arabia and then continued east destroying the Dravidians along the way into India. Who were then relegated to the bottom of the society they established as untouchables. In India, Dravidians are considered cursed and must therefore suffer as a result of it. When the British invaded India and found the similarities between themselves and these early European who first colonized India they naturally assumed these cultural traditions as an extension of European intellectualism now Sanskrit is considered apart of the European family of languages. The Europeans who exterminated the Veddoids in the middle East became Arabs and Persians. The Hyksos, were a nomadic people who initiated the fall of Egypt, guess who they are now, it wasn't until in the 18th Dynasty having suffered colonization, upper Egypt requested assistance from Ethiopia to help expel these people. Egypt was then conquered by the Persians who took what they wanted and left. Then the Greeks came, followed by the Romans then the Arabs came in after to finish the job. Where are these peoples now who the European have claimed ownership as being theirs. I can appreciate your alarm. Egypt civilized Greece and Greece invaded Egypt under Ptolemy, who was a general under Alexander the \textbf{homosexual}. The greatest of the Ptolemy rulers was Cleopatra.

When the United States was attacked as a result of September 11. The United States relied on article 5 which  warranted its allies to give it assistance to destroy Iraq and Afghanistan. When the United States went before the United \textbf{Nation} with its evidence which later turned out to be false. While the American government could claim a failure in its intelligence apparatus to the American people. The UN should have tried every country which participated in an illegal invasion. But, since America with its allies are the founding members of the UN. Well, you see the contradiction. America and her allies, the coalition of willing invaded and destroyed two countries illegally in this example. Where were the tribunals which persecuted \textbf{Nazi} war criminals, Serbian war criminals, Liberian war criminals, Iraqi war criminals, etc they were silent. While NATO destroys countless countries whose population assume NATO has some divine responsibility to govern the planet, as if colonization 2.0 was the new paradigm. The population of these alliance members are silent to the crimes perpetrated by their democratically elected governments. The only thing these population seemingly want to cry out against are the people who suffer. Who are then forced to migrate by foot.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small ~*~ thanks shane starr. other note, una bomber comment is an illusion pushed a lot, 'amercunz got gunz' is an illusion and doesn't matter. Obviously with the mass destruction here, and around the world, americunz clinging to gunz didn't stop any of that, did it. Too busy swallowing false history and 'mericunz tough' bs including the illusion of 'govt',  so-called 'founders' were masons. Who's a pay-triot to those calling themselves govt doing lies and mass destruction, fact is 'patriots' protect those making the problem. Should have been protecting this territory from the destruction or mass immigration, not just 'ileegal' but all of it, now too late, yet dupes continue listening to 'wall' bs, fake act from fake presidents. Sitting clinging to gunz does \textbf{nothing}. Protesting would have or still could make a difference if soon, but we see dupes rather sit to bitter end. That's why the situation is as it is, dummies expect 'someone else' do it. it's always too late by the time dupes bother to do anything. lookup geoengineeringwatch . That's how control works. What can do, use notes with info and web links to inform others, easier than talking, putting copy pass on at bottom also gives others something to do. also see petman robot. Knowing facts and being serious and sharing info is productive, sitting in a hole with gunz doesn't stop anything. Who do we think is behind the 'prepper' bs. Those in the cabal, because it does \textbf{nothing} to stop anything. It's female, and hiding, not doing. The una bomber thing, if people bothered to read his writing, the point was 'right' wing' is a con same as 'left'. Two sides same coin.  That was a setup,  to put some truth in the face of dupes, which was ignored as usual. From 'inquistions' to warring the world the last hundred years to 'bailouts' and everything else krisjuns sat for all and still follow 'govt' masters because they're weak and selfish while telling themselves their 'good people'. The idea of 'tough mericunz' is bs. Thousands of years the phony 'right' watch others die and the earth that feeds them get run over till they get knocked off themselves. Obviously the 'meek' do Not 'inherit' anything. They get kicked in the face. That is natural law. They chose fake 'money' and bogus religion instead of freedom and still do. Now the 'petman' robots can take the gunz, thank you very much. I'm sure they will be polite about it.  Last bit, may want to copy comments that make sensebe ecause a lot of what's on the net is cabal shills.  also disconnect modem first, hardly matters now with all the surveil stuff being done, but just a note.

Some of these startups have gone on to be high-profile exits — Waze, which sold to Google for \$1.3 billion, and recently Mobileye to Intel for \$15.3 billion, among many, many others. Just for comparison, France has .112 startups for every 1,400 people. Germany has .056 startups for every 1,400 people, and the UK has .21 startups for every 1,400 people."

You've never been surrounded by dingo's on Frazer island looking for dinner and it's you. I have. People have been killed on Frazer and other places by dingo's. Emu's may look like funny buggers but it'll kick and break your leg. And snakes. Razorback wild boar will rip you into lamb chops with their tusks if they catch you on foot, and not to mention a nasty bite from a goanna that will fester, or running into a stinging tree in the middle of the night in the rainforest or huge spider webs. And snakes. There are scorpions like in other deserts and poisonous fish in the seas and the rivers like bull rout, and bull sharks right up the rivers. Great whites off the coast that rip into people in places like Byron Bay and South Australia and everywhere. Crocs aren't alligator's, both are dangerous but crocs are much more aggressive hunters and killers. Muck about in the wrong place and you'll be gone in split seconds. Don't swim your dogs, they make great shark or croc bait. A lot of the beaches aren't protected. And snakes. The platypus is poisonous and jelly fish in the oceans and beaches of this big country are extremely toxic and deadly. Including the Australian salt water cone snail (world's most deadly) and blue ringed octopus which will both kill you in a very short time. Being stranded in the outback is a regular killer.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small For Canada they forgot about the fact that rural Canadians have a long history of hunting and many are good with guns and bow (no, guns are not banned in Canada, especially the hunting rifle which is still a pretty staple part of many sectors of Canada culture, Canada was literally built on a fur trade) which means that in addition to military if you went North to South you'd have to pass km of people used to living in rural, isolated climates who would be decently skilled at killing...which would make attacking from the North even more insane (granted, if you came from the South you'd have a lot more dense population where people are typically less familiar with guns cause you can't really hunt in cities, but this effect ends within about 200km of the boarder in many areas) and Canada also historically up and moves their capital city to make it harder to attack. See, when you take a \textbf{Nation}'s capital, you take the \textbf{nation}, so for over 200 years the Canadian strategy has been to move the capital if they feel threatened to make it harder to attack. Imagine Russia with a mobile Moscow and you get the idea. Canadians in general tend to be fairly mobile, historically their ability to relocate everything and anything to make attacking them like trying to hit a needle in a haystack. Now a days with more Canadians being accustom to cities and more of Canada "built" rather than being mobile camps it would be harder, but its still a substantial part of the culture, especially in rural areas. And they are the most fresh water rich country on Earth, which means no matter who attacks them they're going to have allies jump to their side to get some access to that water (they also are huge exporters of other natural resources but water is likely to become their biggest this century). Not that they aren't placed appropriately on the list its just additional considerations that they didn't cover that would make Canada a very annoying place to attack.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nation & \cellcolor{green!27}Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/349 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.287 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Yazan shalaldeh couple of things you got wrong here, which also show that yes, you have been fed propaganda:1. the temple business: according to Judaism (i'm simplifying this because this is not my field of expertise, but this is generally correct) the construction of the 3rd temple will be done when the messiah comes down to earth on a white donkey.The closest anyone's currently getting to construct a 3rd temple in israel is the jewish community that believe that by bringing more jews into the religion and out of secular life, and by praying, the day of salvation and the return of the messiah will come earlier.No one's taking dozers to Al Aqsa mosque.In fact, if you'd ask those jews who believe in this, most of them will probably tell you that it's not their place to begin the work of constructing the temple before geing told to do so by the messiah, who naturally will be appointed by god himself.I'm not a man of religion myself (though I try to respect others' in general) so to me that's as \textbf{crazy} as riding into heaven on a donkey or reviving after 3 days in the sun nailed to a cross with a spear wound in my ribs - but even then, the Al Aqsa mosque is not going anywhere unless god himself sends his messengers from heaven to declare the end of days and the day of redemption.In fact, for the most part, the israeli government has done it's best to make sure freedom of religion is maintained in Jerusalem so that anyone and everyone can come and worship their religion in their holy sites - as far as I am aware, the only restrictions on who can come into the city and the sites is whoever can pass the security check in the airport, and is allowed to enter the country, just like in any other country with any sort of border control.Now, if I wanted, as someone who's Israeli and Jewish in origin (again, not religious), to enter the Al Aqsa mosque, it's almost guaranteed (to the point where for this to be otherwise, the hand of god himself must assist me) that if I were to try to visit Al Aqsa mosque simply to see the place and look at the ancient architecture (as I've done in the church of the Holy Spelecure, beautiful place BTW), I'd be refused because it'd cause a disruption and I'd be lynched.if any Muslim tourist wanted to visit the wailing wall or the aforementioned church? they can go right ahead.The country will actively restrict the rights of it's citizens to maintain the peace between religions to it's best ability, which definitely was not the case under jordanian rule before '67.Don't believe me? go ahead and try it for yourself.2. Israelis, to your great surprise, don't mind their arab cousins, and I personally know many of my friends that have close arab friends.If you'd go around and ask who gives the best hospitality in israel, you'd probably be told that it's the Bedouins and arabs, and in many places like in the \textbf{old} city of jaffa, there's coexistence.Israelis do have a problem with being stabbed, fired at with rockets, run over by terror cars and trucks, and being blown up by some \textbf{crazy} idiot who wants 72 virgins. I believe you don't like these things any more than I do. they are not good for your health.The security fences came up because of this, the naval blockade came up because of this, and the past operations in lebanon and gaza came to be because of this - don't take my word for this; research this stuff on the internet in reliable and unbiased sources.Israeli society has been built by immigrants and survivors from all nations of the world and we're used to different cultures - and while things at times were rough, in the end we managed to get along fine enough to make a country out of it - so if there was to be peace in the future, I have no doubt Palestinians and gazans could come to tel aviv like anyone else; it may take some time to let past wounds heal, but after they do, this would be very much possible.On the other side, look at all arab nations: they had large jewish communities and those communities liked it there, and viewed themselves as true citizens of those countries; they had friends and family, houses, a whole life in places like Yemen and Iraq and Algeria.So let me ask this: where are their jews?in regards to your answer to how the country may look like: "hundreds of nations" is a bit of an exaggeration, but yes, there are many people with different origins in Israel.Each of them brought with them their culture and tradition, and with time those all became part of the Israeli culture; it's not about taking other people's culture and putting a blue and white flag on top of it, but rather acknowledging that their culture is different, and accepting it into our society, allowing us to experience that culture, and them to experience ours. there's to such thing as a "jewish novi god" or "jewish ramadan", for example.I'm very uncertain that if it wasn't israel that was here, but some other country in arab control, this would not be the case, though - just check out the case of the stables of king solomon, which is just one case out of several occasions where arceological sites of great significance to jews (though not only jews, in some cases) were destroyed by non israeli entities - be it the Palestinian authorities in the west bank, or the waqf in Jerusalem.Considering the great respect which israel shows to other religions, these come as a slap in the face, as I am sure you would agree - it's akin to someone spitting in your food after inviting them to eat with you.And I don't see many arab countries that are free democracies either.And as far as the killing of innocents goes - this is almost ENTIRELY the fault of hamas in gaza.When they choose to shoot a rocket towards a kindergarten or school in some israeli settlement (which is fucked up), the israeli army, as an army committed to defend the country, needs to take care of this threat to the people, and thus destroy the launcher.Despite this, due to concerns of hitting civilians, many retaliatory attacks on launch sites are often canceled, and hamas has taken  advantage of this by hiding rockets and launchers at schools and hospitals, and using families as shields and their back yards as launch sites.In response, the army began telling people where it's going to attack so they can leave the area beforehand, by dropping leaflets, and even calling them on their phones and texting them, so they can get to safety; this is something no army has done for civilian population before, I can tell you that much; just look at the civilian casualties in syria, or in any other war at that.If israel wanted to destroy gaza, there isn't much gaza can do to stop them, or anyone at that. It has not happened because it'd be monstrous, and it's unnecessary. we don't want To kill close to 2 million people more than the next american, or Frenchman, or Australian, or what have you.So that's my reply. Yours?And I'd like you to be a bit more specific in your reply, if possible - if we want to tackle real specific issues, we must state them clearly, and it's difficult for me to research a topic I'm not familiar with, when I can't understand what it even is, if you are not clear and specific when describing it.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Crazy, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}3/1327 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.226 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Arab armies are led by corrupt self serving officer corps.any officer who shows guts or real leadership.is quickly removed.Israelie junior officers are usually selected from the very best enlisted men and women. they are supported by very able non commissioned officers who will take over if their officer is killed or seriously wounded.Arab soldiers are not respected by their incompetent officers,they are often left to die by their superiors.Arabs soldiers can be brave fighters  however their command system  is made up of \textbf{fat} lazy incompetent \textbf{senior} officers and unless non commissioned officers.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Fat, Senior & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s, Physical Identity - Physical Features & \cellcolor{green!27}2/92 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.174 \\  \hline

Nepal has never been ruled by any country and as you mentioned the British attacking Bhutan, I think this was the case with Nepal to be honest. The British attacked Nepal but due to high fatalities both counties signed a treat called Treaty of Sugauli in which Nepal lost part of its land which was annexed to India after the British left India and was never given back to Nepal. After the war and the treaty of Sugauli the British were very impressed with the Nepalese army and was taken aback by the ferocious Gurkhas (Nepalese Army) and since then they actually have been hiring the Gurkhas from Nepal into British \& \textbf{Indian} Army.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Historically we have seen many countries had been destroyed or invaded by other countries and We have one such country dat is not just gonna roll over and DAT country is PAKISTAN.Top facts dat why Pakistan can never be conquered,1 : The terrain, wat makes Pakistan difficult to invade is the terrain. The geography of Pakistan is a profound blunt of land scapes, varying from plains to deserts, forests \& hills. Any army or any invader could just fade away into the mountains \& lick there wounds until the next fighting season comes, All these factors make Pakistan a tough place to wage war in.2 : The Marshal Blood, Pakistani \textbf{nation} is divided into segments of various ethncities, which have there own unique history as fighters \& Warriors, who were highly regarded in the marshal \textbf{race} by the British-\textbf{Indian} Army for winning them many battles in the war.3 : \textbf{Nationalism}, Does your invading army plan on fighting 200 million people, who are armed to the teeth and willing to die and fight for there country, because that is whats likely going to happen while invading Pakistan. Pakistan was able to keep its culture and history relatively intact, plus there is a strong sense of \textbf{nationality} \& identity amongst its population, which keeps them united  against external threats, whenever there is a war citizens join its military to defend there country, FOR example  >  In 1948 war Pashtun Tribes drove \textbf{indian} soldiers out from parts of Kashmir and in 1965 war where thousands of Sindh citizens repelled \textbf{Indian} aggression against Sindh, which due to shortage of Military troops became extremely vulnerable. \textbf{Nationalism} has kept Pakistanians United and any invader in Pakistan is not just facing the military but also its 200 million people too.4 : ISI \& PAK MILITARY, Pakistan has the 6th largest battled hardened, best trained and best equipped army in the world with hundreds of Nuclear Weapons, as far as invading Pakistan goes  The last time an invading army was on Pakistani borders was during the 2001 to 2002, Pakistan \& india military standoff, >  According to the TIMES OF INDIA REPORT standoff inflicted heavy casualties on \textbf{indian} side, due to artillary duels with Pakistan, 1874 to 2467 indain soldiers were killed \& india could not cross the international border.5 : Islamic Ideology, Pakistan is the only country to have been created in the name of Islam, from which Pakistanians draw there spiritual and national strenght, Islam provides them the motivation to survive in the toughest human conditions and conviction to fight the enemies even if they are more powerful.............

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I checked all your data. You being a pakistani obviously are giving biased views. In every war with India it seems data suggests that there was more losses in the pakistani side. India never had the objective to invade pakistan. It was Pakistan which tried to invade and take kashmir from India which till today Pakistan has been trying. Then is the fact which I came across that more than  92000 pakistan soldiers surrendered to \textbf{Indian} army in 1971 leading to break away of East pakistan which is today Bangladesh. \textbf{Nationalism} is not only a thing in Pakistan. \textbf{Nationalism} and patriotism exists in every country.

Invading pakistan will be a big liability with its terrorists safe havens and dire economic conditions. 2.Every war with India was started by pakistan. So pakistan is the aggressor with an objective to take Kashmir from India. So technically pakistan has always been the invader which has consistently failed to attain its objective. 4.Pakistan army  is well aware that it is no match for the \textbf{Indian} army and that is the reason it uses terrorists for asymmetrical warfare. Your own military general told that the terrorists are the front line defense for pakistan. And some terrorists rats sneaking across the border and killing unaware unprepared soldiers in India and Afghanistan is an act of cowardice not valor and something to be proud of. 5.

It was separated a year or so after India declared independence from the United Kingdom.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Darth Molag Bal Sigh, I honestly have no use arguing with you because you have been brainwashed by a lack of information provided by the Pakistani government, the lack of capacity to see the world from alternate perspectives due to the mandated religious teachings of Islam and your own sheer \textbf{nationalism}.For the record, I do not live in Israel nor am I Jewish, I'm an atheist.Come back when you actually know what you are talking about.1-Israel was formed from British territory after WWII2-Pakistan was formerly known as West India post separation. After a bloody resolution in which 23 million Indians and Pakistanis died trying to cross the border, Pakistan was formed.3-Terrorists identify themselves as Muslims, although their ideals do not really match the Qu'arn.4-Pakistan has an extremely weak military. You have lost 3 wars to India, and have never actually won a war against another country of comparable size and power.5-The US and NATO funded Islamic militants to fight off the Soviet Union in the Cold War when they invaded Afghanistan. After the fighting was over, the Muslims turned on the US and NATO, thus terrorists were born.6-Muslims are not 'rapists' because the actions are not seen as rape. In a Muslim religious state, women are required to wear face veils else to bring shame to their family and be seen as slaves rather than as women.7-You are making reference to a rape culture which does not exist. Women in the first world do not wear little clothing because they are 'asking to be raped', they wear it because they want to and are not mandated to wear any clothing because a book tells them so.8-You can't "rape yourself".9-Inferring I rape people on a regular basis is extremely fucked up. Like seriously. You need to get something checked out if you think I do that.10-Labeling the US and NATO as terrorists is contradictory to your own values. You use the internet, which is supporting these so called 'terrorists', yet you condemn terrorists? Something tells me your logic is very, very backwards.11-Congratulations, you pulled a quote from 1967 when Pakistan was actually feared. You guys are now an international joke. You lost 3 wars to India by a landslide. Your military is pathetic. Pakistan is not the country it was in 1967. It's a fragment of its previous self, and this is due to poor governing and a lack of knowledge amongst the population. 12-On the subject of Pakistan being a country of idiots, you have a 58 literacy rate based on this years census run by your government. Barely over half of your population can write. Meanwhile Russia has a 96 tertiary education rate. 13-Israel is not a base of terrorists. Last time I checked, they never launched a first strike campaign. They always retaliated, something terrorists never do.14-Terrorists are not godless, again, they are predominantly Muslim with twisted views.15-Pakistan is not a \textbf{terrorist} country nor is it a country to be feared. It is a joke. You have a stupid and complacent population and a corrupt government. Your economy is in shambles and you expect to compete with the first world on the sheer basis that Islam is (INCOMING BULLSHIT) the greatest religion in the world? LOL. Please, more jokes. Islam being the greatest religion in the world is a load of crap.16-Pakistan is a shit country, end of discussion.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nationalism, Terrorist & \cellcolor{green!27}Nationality - General, Religious Identity - Muslim & \cellcolor{green!27}2/577 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.347 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small DynamiteDog, Damn bro u did whole lot of research on our country. If u look at it this way:1. Pakistan is the only country in today's world to have fought 4 wars with a country 10 times its size, 20 times its population, 10 times its military, 20 times its economy, and is still standing. We may have lost those wars but we weren't defeated.2. Literacy rate doesn't have anything to do with whether a \textbf{nation} can protect itself or not, although its extremely important that we improve it further. Remember there's difference between upbringing and education, and we have significant amount of the former.3. U mentioned afghan war \& Russia, so u should know: Last time Pakistan indirectly fought a war with a superpower it was called Soviet Union, now it's called Russia.4. U r bringing in Islam for no reason at all. Hitler is called \textbf{terrorist} and he was Christian, so does it make all Christians the same, NO. \textbf{Terrorist} have no religion, when will u guys get it. They just use it for their own purpose, similar to Christian invasions some centuries ago.5. Now who do u call \textbf{terrorist}. Do people who fight for their right against invaders (USA,Israel) while the invaders slaughter every man,\textbf{woman} and child they can get their hands on, be called \textbf{terrorist}??? I can talk in detail about how many Palestinians have been killed,displaced and simply put "butchered" by Isreal since its creation as well as how much blood Uncle Sam has on its hand, if u want to debate it.6. Islam doesn't glorify rape, what are your sources to support your claim or r u spewing the same shit as CNN.7. Pakistan is the country that's always been throughout history been taken lightly and called "shit" by its opponents full of arrogance (Soviets,India,USA) and u know what, Pakistan has always survived and will Inshallah.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small YOU MISSED INDIA 'ARMY'India has around 1.2 million active personnel, 4,426 combat tanks, 6,704 armoured fighting vehicles, 290 self-propelled artillery, 7,414 towered artillery and 290 rocket projectors. 'NAVY'India's naval assets include 295 vessels, with three aircraft carriers (one each in service, under construction and being planned), 14 frigates, 11 destroyers, 23 corvettes, 15 submarines, 139 patrol craft and six mini warfare vessels. 'AIR FORCE'India's total aircraft strength is about 2102, with 676 fighter aircraft, 809 attack aircraft, 857 transporters and 323 trainer aircraft. Total helicopters are around 666, including 16 attack helicopters. NUCLEAR STOCKPILEIndia's nuclear stockpile has around 130 warheads. Minimum tactical missile range is about 150 km, farthest strike distance tested successfully is 5,000-6,000 km (Agni -V). Surya, an intercontinental ballistic missile being developed, has a range up to 16,000 km. Almost 40 of the \textbf{Indian} border is along the water, Arabian Sea, \textbf{Indian} Ocean and Bay of Bengal.You can reach India easily. Now let's answer the question. To invade India you need to work out a way of tackling the mighty \textbf{Indian} Armed Forces once you have reached India. You need to have a force which can fight against the 1.3 million strong armed men determined to fight till death for their country. To back that force you have a million strong paramilitary forces.we also have 8  different specially trained paramilitary armed force1.MARCOS- MARCOS or Marine Commandos is India's most lethal special force. Though they are trained to engage in battle on all terrains, MARCOS commandos are experts in maritime warfare. The physical test to join MARCOS is so gruesome that more than 80 per cent of the applicants drops out in the first, three-day long, physical fitness and aptitude test. Those who successfully complete the test are subjected to a five-week-long process called the ‘hell's week' where commandos are put through extreme sleep deprivation coupled with the most difficult physical tasks. These commandos are even capable of firing while lying down, standing, running full-sprint, even backwards and looking into a mirror – with a reaction time of 0.27 seconds. The final stages of the training include an 800-meter long thigh-high mud crawl called the ‘death crawl', loaded with 25 kg of gear which is concluded with shooting a target 25 meters away with a man standing next to it. \textbf{Old} MARCOS gear.2.Para Commandos-Para commandos is one of the most highly trained special forces of the \textbf{Indian} Army. Because of the extremely fatal nature of the operations they perform, they are kept at optimum level of operational efficiency and physical fitness, and only the most physically fit, mentally robust, intelligent, and highly motivated soldiers are inducted in the fleet. Para commandos go through the most grueling commando training regimes in the world, apart from daily 20km runs with 60km baggage and man-to-man assault practices; they even have to free fall from belligerent heights of as much as 33,500 feet. They are also highly trained in terrain and environment warfare and deep sea diving. Their most notable and fatal operations included the 1971 war with Pakistan, the 1999 Kargil war and the infamous Operation Bluestar in 1984. 3. Garud Commando Force-With over 2000 commandos, the Garud Commando Force is a unit of the \textbf{Indian} Air Force and specializes in Airfield Seizure, Special Reconnaissance, Airborne Operations, Air Assault, Special Operations Combat Search and Rescue, and counterinsurgency. The training for being a Garud commando is so tough that it can take up to 3 years to qualify as a fully operational Garud. Also, Garud commandos are extremely adept at anti-hijack and counterinsurgency training, jungle and snow survival techniques, specialized weapon handling and advanced driving skills.4. Ghatak force is a special operations infantry platoon that acts as shock troops and leads man-to-man assaults ahead of a battalion. They specialize in raids on enemy artillery positions, airfields, supply dumps and tactical headquarters while also being experts at directing artillery and air attacks on targets deep within enemy lines. Only the most physically and mentally fit soldiers make it into the Ghatak force which is usually 20-men strong. Since they face the enemy face-to-face, they are trained to be undisputed at heli-borne assault, rock climbing, mountain warfare, demolitions, advanced weapons training, close quarter battle and infantry tactics.5. National Security Guard Or \textbf{Black} Cats-Created in 1986, the NSG or \textbf{Black} Cats fall neither under Central Armed Police Forces nor under Paramilitary Forces of India. It's instead a mix of commandos from both the \textbf{Indian} Army and Central Armed Police Forces which is lead by a ‘Director General' from the \textbf{Indian} Police Service. Comprising two units – the Special Action Group (SAG), which consists entirely of \textbf{Indian} Army personnel; and the Special Ranger Groups (SRG) for counterterrorism activities – the NSG is equipped with some of the most advanced weapons in the world. The selection process is so brutal that it has a dropout rate of 70-80 per cent. And the few, who qualify to become NSGs, are sent off to train for another 9 months to become Phantom NSG Commandos6.COBRA (Commando Battalion for Resolute Action)ommando Battalion for Resolute Action is probably the only \textbf{Indian} special force that is specifically trained in guerilla warfare to tackle the notorious Naxalite groups in the country. A part of the CRPF, COBRA commandos are masters of camouflage, jungle warfare, parachute jumps, precision strikes and ambushes. Their sniper units are also one of the best among the armed forces of India.7. Special Frontier Force-Created on 14th November 1962, the SFF is a paramilitary special force which specializes in special reconnaissance, direct action, hostage rescue, counter-terrorism, unconventional warfare and covert operations. This specialized force was created in the wake of another Sino-\textbf{Indian} war and it operates in sync with RAW (Research and Analysis Wing). The commandos are supremely trained in guerrilla tactics, mountain and jungle warfare, and parachute jumps. 8.Force One-After the Mumbai terror attacks, the Maharashtra government brought together the best commandos and assembled the youngest \textbf{Indian} special force called Force One. The sole motive of this squad is to protect the Mumbai metropolitan area when under threat. Force One is one of the fastest response teams in the world and can get ready for action in less than 15 minutes. From over 3000 applications, 216 of the best soldiers were selected who were then trained under close guidance from the Israeli Special Forces.On top of that, there are like a billion people.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Your FACT is incorrect.Russia first off is financially hurting REALLY bad. Russia wouldn't have the funds to take on America.Since Russia started loosing their oil exports to America they are hurting for money.Most of Russias military equipment and missiles date back to the Cold War. Over half of the tanks , airplanes and missles (including nukes) are \textbf{old} as crap.If it was a 1 v 1 USA vs Russia, USA would win hands down. There would be a LOT of bloodshed on both sides but honestly if the 2 powerhouses fought it would turn nuclear quick.Like I said too, most if Russias nuclear missiles are from the Cold War era. Which means they are EASY to intercept by missile defense systems. (Which America has the most advanced and precise missile defense systems in the world). It's actually such a good system that America took one to Israel and Israel has used it to fight off Islamic countries often. Missiles can't get through it.Russia relied on German and French Satellites.... they are no longer in orbit and no longer work.Russia has a few Missile Defense systems through out the country but they are not only \textbf{old} but not as reliable. Their intercept rate is around 60. Where USA's is around 99.Since Russia's nuclear missile are so \textbf{old} their slow speeds make them easy to intercept. Where as America has newer more advanced nuclear missiles and some of the mid-sized ones can re-enter the atmosphere faster than any of the Russian defense systems can intercept.But, there is no reason for Russians to hate America. Trump and Putin get along, unlike Obama and Hillary Clinton who blame everything on Putin.But don't be fooled into thinking Russia is invincible and that they could single handedly take out America. I'm here to tell you, that would never happen. America also has enough missile defense systems all around the world that America could intercept literally every single Russian nuclear missile without getting touched by a single one.Where Russia would be able to intercept around 45-50 of America's nuclear missiles due to speed limitations on Russia's defense systems and their failure rate on intercepting incoming missiles.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}3/370 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.811 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Mithren Russia is friends with most of the Middle East which are firm enemies of the US. They also have ties to China, North Korea, Kazakstan and Montenegro. Serbian and turkey would join in too. The UK and most the EU would side with America and so would Canada and Ukraine. Japan might join the west but may also stay neutral. The rest of the world will remain Neutral.Some \textbf{common} misconceptions about Russia that American media propaganda is perpetuating is that Russia's military is one of the strongest in the world and putin is actually a good leader. Sure he's corrupt but he's no where near weak, he was brought Russia out of poverty and payed off the soviet debt completely. The US is terrified of Russia due to their military and overall size and your president is scared too.Now into the war, let's cut out nuclear bombs for simplicity's sake.What do the east all have in \textbf{common}? Resilience. The UK is also fairly resilient too. The thing is that the west had no strategy to beat China or Russia. The east in no good because of all the Middle Eastern countries under Russian support would create a blockade (think Afghanistan or Syrian war) and even of they got past then they'd have to fight Russia's army head on which are stronger than most European armies and used to fighting in the extreme cold. Russia is also absolutely huge so a land invasion is barley possible. Capture Moscow? Another capital will take its place. Capture putin? Another leader will rise up. You'll have to decimate the city and wipe out the majority of its population to beat them.You could go for an assault from the east but Siberia is mostly a wasteland and freezing and you'll have to defeat China  which has the biggest population in the world, so, good luck. The EU doesn't have an army either so all the different countries will likely be fighting amongst each other for a plan. The outcome will be many lives lost, Russia and China basically unscathed except for a minor loss of life. It's allies will have taken a big hit for their economy and population  but Russia and China will probably profit from this and so will most of Latin America if we assume they stayed neutral. The UK will likely collapse into the Anglo-welsh Union, Scotland and Northern Ireland which will probably reunite with Ireland. Riots in France will be massive and macron will probably resign. The rest of Europe will probably have its economy damaged too and their allies.The two American giants (Canada and the US) will have taken a minor economic hit but the US would have likely used this as an excuse to capture Kim Jon Un and install a democracy which will cause tensions to rise further between China and the US which may cause a second, bigger, Cold War which China has the advantage on.Russia will have probably annexed Ukraine and Mongolia as well as cut trading ties.Overall, it's a mess but Russia and the US wouldn't have been affected much.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Common & \cellcolor{green!5}Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}2/524 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.382 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small 11. KrikkinikaIf you haven't heard of this country, don't feel bad. The \textbf{nation} is completely isolationist but has an incredible defense plan.First, you'd have to get past their naval strength, which totals around 2,000 vessels all armed with cutting edge weapons and technology. If your forces survive that, you'd then have to make your way through the beaches that are littered with more than 100,000 mines, tank busters, barbed wire emplacements, and several other defenses.But it gets worse. If your forces miraculously managed to make it past that, you'd have to get through a MONSTER defense force of 3 million regular Krikkian soldiers, 18,000 tanks, 15,000 artillery, several thousand heavy machine guns, thousands of well fortified bunkers, and more than 1,000 laser cannons. Losses due to this line of defense would be staggering. But if you thought that was the worst thing to get past, it's even worse.Their fourth line of defense consists of 15 million robotic soldiers that were modeled after the robots from the Terminator and Star Wars films respectively, and armed to the teeth with cutting edge weaponry. The sheer size of these numbers could be enough to essentially plummet morale throughout your forces.If you somehow manage to get past the mass of robotic soldiers, you'd then have to deal with the rest of their army, around 7 million men, and their Air Force, totaling 500,000 aircraft. Even IF you managed to survive that, you'd have to battle the last line of defense: the Kornisikkagratis (Krikkian Guards).These men are veterans of the bloodiest battles in Krikkian wars and are the absolute best in their military, and although only 50,000 of them make up their numbers, their ferocity in combat will be terrifying to your forces considering the losses of the first few lines of defense.In total, even if you managed to successfully invade the country, you'd suffer a Pyrrhic victory and lose a whopping 90 of your original forces.(This is a country I made up.

The Gaza Strip (region of Palestine actually ruled by the Palestinian people) barely received any funds, and its systematic isolation blocks it from boosting a highly exporting economy. Even with its limitations, Palestine had and currently has one of the highest enrollment rates in education and a relatively advanced education system. In addition, before the post-wwII era, many nations that are currently highly advanced in technology, such as Japan and Jordan, were poor in the fields of education and technology and pursued such due to their relative importance in a time of extreme technological advancement. Therefore, it is baseless to assume Palestine does not value education.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nation & \cellcolor{green!27}Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/141 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.709 \\  \hline

Palestine's government has done absolutely \textbf{nothing} to improve the economy. It's a joke and it shows the reasons the people look to Hamas for leadership.Even just after Israel's independence the amount of patents where far ahead of any innovation in the land's history. Even before Israel's independence when the land had a small minority of Jews the vast amount of patents came from the small minority of Jews (around 15). That's a very sad statistic. So you can blame Israel on all of Palestine's problems but the truth it the problems existed before Israel and Israel has continued to grow despite it only being around for short time.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small ​\@SkyGlitcher What are you talking about? Another kid twisting history to cover his own agenda. Let me explain this in a way you will understand the truth of the matter is the Ottoman ruled "Palestine" and the British promised the Jews the land; however, the British also promised the Muslims (majority of the inhabitants) the land. The British, after having beaten the Ottoman, created a colony in Palestine instead of holding either side of the bargain. During this control more and more Jews from Europe (during WW2) became to migrate to Palestine. The population of the Jews in the country increased dramatically (becoming around 30-40 of the population). This became a problem because the Arabs hated the Jews. Most of the Arabs at the time had no real ownership of the land, they squatted on it and some rented it. The Jews began buying the land from absentee Arabs and evicting squatters. (of course the Arabs cried and shouted "They stole it :(" when infact it was perfectly legal way of obtaining land). For this the Arabs hated the Jews and treated the Jewish immigrants very poorly. The Arabs wanted their own \textbf{nation} and wanted the British out. They revolted against the British but Jewish militias and British soldiers fought back and suppressed the attack. Britain decided they didn't want to have to deal with the problem anymore so they outsourced the problem to the newly created UN. The UN separated the land equally between the Jews and Arabs but the plan didn't work as expected. Palestine did not see this as fair separation of the country and so a war broke out. Palestine got there ass handed to the and all they want to do is complain about how "Israel stole the land!".Furthermore, don't try to twist history to fit your narrative. Israel gave back the land occupied when they won and the vast majority of the land that wasn't given back was paid back. I understand that not all of what Israel did was justified and the Jew settlements are certainly wrong. This doesn't give anyone the right the rewrite history because they don't like what Israel is doing now.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nation & \cellcolor{green!27}Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/363 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.275 \\  \hline

SOME THINGS THAT THE TRUE AMERICAN CHRISTIAN WILL KILL AND FIGJT TILL DEATH AND THEN SOME FIRST YOU CANT STOP ANY TRUE CHRISTIAN OF THE LORD TO CONVERT TO MOHAMMADS AAAHLAY SNACK BAR. MOHAMMAD IS THE FIRST OF THE 4 HORSEMEN OF THE APOCALYPSE  AND WHO EVER TOOK OVER HIS SATAN RELIGION NEXT IS THE 3RD. AND SO ON THE OTHER 2. YOUR \textbf{QURAN} SAYS GABRIEL TOLD THE  MOHAMMAD THE  GOSPIL. \textbf{QURAN} IN A CAVE WHAT 100 A.D. AFTER JWSUS DIED OK AND \textbf{QURAN} SAYS ISHMEAL WAS THE GOOD AND TRUE SOON AND ISSAC WASNT. OK 1ST KING DAVID WROTENFROM CAVES ALOT OF BOOK OF PSALMS. AND HAD SOME BAD ENCOUNTERS WITH 1 OF THE ANGELS AND EVEN GOD. BUT AFTER GOD FORGAVE HE STAYED IN THE MOUNTAINS AND WROTE ABUNCH OF BOOK OF PSALMS.  SO MOHAMMED AND DAVID WROTE FROM CAVES GABRIEL TOLD ISLAM RELIGION WHILE AFTER DAVID GOT STRAIGHT WITH THE LORD WITH 600 GOLD SHECKELS THATS ABOUT \$600,000 TODAY. GOD STOPPED THE SWORD DRAWN BY THE ANGEL OF JUDGEMENT SAID PUT AWAY THE SWORD.  So now we have the bible and teachings from gabriel and God b.c.  and 400 years later gaberial finds MOHAMMAD and tells him a different RELIGION involving a ALLAH AND END END TIMES THE OTHER RELIGIONS IF WONT CONVERT MURDER THEM. SO GABRIEL HAS TALKED OF THE GOD OF ABRAHAM TO DAVID. AND AFTER CHRIST HE SUDDENLY CHANGED HIS STORY AND WENT TO MOHAMMAD. THIERS SEVERAL JUST FLAT OUT IGNORANT LIES HERE. YOUR RELIGION AND ALLAH THE GREAT DECIVER KNEW OF BEGINNING OF ADAM AND EVE. SO FIRST DONT EXCEPT. A TRUE CHRISTIAN TO EVER ACCEPT ALLAH IF YOU THINK YOU CAN MURDER CHRIST CHILDREN I GUESS TRY BECAUSE FAITH KNOWS NOT ANY FEAR. WHEN THE GOG MAGOG WAR GETS HERE AND THE 144,000 WITNESSES CHRISTIANS ARE GATHERED AND THE OTHE 2 MILLION ARE SURROUNDING AND KILLING CHRISTIANS THE 1 THAT ISLAM CALLS A PROPHET OF WHOMEVER OF COURSE A MASSS MAJORITY WILL SCREAMING ALLAH SNACK BAR CATHOLICS HAIL MARIES WE GOT 2 CHURCHES THAT WERE BROUGHT FROM ROME AND WE ALL NO HOW LOVING ROME IS BUT WHEN THE MUSLIMS PROFIT COMES FROM HEAVEN ONA WHITE HORSE. 1ST OF ALL HE WEARS GOLD KING OF KINGS LORD OF LORDS. ALLAHS PROFIT WOULDN'T WEAR THAT THE ONLY SINLESS MORTAL HUMAN TO WALK EARTH AND DRIVE NAILS THRU HIM HE ISNT GOING TO ENJOY SEEING HIS WITNESSES BEING MURDERED AND PROBABLY WONT CARE TO BE KNOWN AS A PROPHET. SO WITH 1 LASH OF THE TONGUE. 2MILLION INSTANT DEATH. And the blood shall run the depth of bridles of a horse and all water on earth turn to blood. When God gave the Jews the land in Israel and they were ran out land seized but after ww2 the ROTHSCHILDS RESERVE BOUGHT THE JEWS THIER LAND BACK. OH BUT I ALMOST FORGOT THIER WAS A MOSQUE BUILT CLOSE WHERE THE SECOND TEMPLE WAS.

My country isn't gonna apologize for things that happened hundreds of years ago and that \textbf{nobody} alive played a part in.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Dave Walker You're forgetting the past 70 years, Australian government was just a bunch of British representatives who operated under the Queen, that is why that you will find that in South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand, most of the horrible \textbf{racism} that occurred was part of the laws. As well as this most of the government who weren't representatives for the British empire, came in from England. Only recently (less than 100 years ago), did NZ and AU become more than just British Colonies. Around the time that the killing happened Australia barely had a government. I'm sorry, but on the Australia one Britain fucked up. Also, I understand that most of Western Europe was horrible too. But while Spain and Portugal were searching for gold, and Italy was just being Italy, and everyone was trying to conquer Africa, Britain was continuing even after they had control.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Racism & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/148 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.676 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Michael Ferguson while Britain still owned Australia they had their own government and the British had very little influence on the politics of the country, Australian apartheid only ended 40 or so years ago, long after the end of British ownership. And South \textbf{African} apartheid was initiated by the Afrikaans who are the majority white population in South Africa. You don't know enough about history you just have an agenda against the UK. The Portuguese and Spanish weren't just looking for gold they were colonizing, enslaving and murdering every native they laid eyes on. The Spanish once even put a bounty out on a native tribe and offered extra money for women and children in an attempt to wipe them off the face of the earth. Don't even start on the French because their empire was the most brutal around, the British were simply the best at empire building therefore there's more cases to look at. But the British acted the same as all empirical nations did, there was \textbf{nothing} especially brutal about the British empire. I don't know if you're part Maori and that's why you're so angry at Britain but if you're gonna slate Britain so much at least be consistent and hold all other empires to the same standard. Every country on earth has done brutal things, the entire human \textbf{race} has a history of violence and war but you don't ask them all to apologise. Rid yourself of your ridiculous agenda and look at the world with a level head, it was a different era and many countries are guilty of the same things as the UK.

So it's ok that the Spanish and Portuguese committed genocide because they were after gold? 😂😂 the British were after natural resources as well, that was the entire Point of colonialism we didn't do it for a laugh and to kill some natives. You quite clearly have an issue with the UK because you're happy to demonize us and make excuses for everybody else. What about the French? And the USA who had the largest slave trade in the history of humanity? They get a free pass because you don't give a shit about that you're just mad the British killed maoris? How idiotic are you to think that the UK had no goal? You don't invade a quarter of the planet to kill natives you do it to make money, and your teacher obviously didn't teach you that the Uk was the first western country to end slavery and actively policed the trade, arresting any slavers they caught in the Caribbean and west Africa.  Also I know other countries have done worse that's my whole fucking point ffs, I just mentioned the nations that had empires similar to Britain and were in Western Europe. You have a big issue that you need to get over, I'm British and I didn't kill any maoris, Africans, Indians or Asians and I won't accept responsibility for something that happened 150 years ago, grow up and move on stop living in the past.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Racism & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/302 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.331 \\  \hline

You've repeatedly tried to claim the British empire was the most evil of the bunch when if you look at the history they all have almost identical stories of killing, enslaving and ripping off local populations. These empires were built to build money and influence for a \textbf{nation} not to be friendly and they often left soldiers to do as they please which is where you'll find horrific stories of slaughter and rape from colonial soldiers from all of these empires. I understand why you hate the British empire the most, because it's had more of an effect on your culture than the other empires did but don't think that means the British were worse than the others. Don't try and enter a debate about which country is more powerful than who based on nukes or numbers because I'm fully informed on the topic and know exactly where each country's standing is in the world. And don't forget whether you'd want to be involved or not New Zealand would absolutely, undoubtedly side with Britain in any conflict in the future and I'm very grateful we have a strong relationship with your country even if people like you hate us. I know New Zealand is filled with happy, friendly and intelligent people who are also peaceful but don't forget you fight like hero's when you need to and have always stuck by your friends in conflicts, playing a significant role in ww2 with Australia and cementing a friendship with Britain that will last for centuries. I recently did an ancestry test and found I have over 100 distant relatives living in New Zealand as well, we are a lot closer than you think culturally and politically.

Just please comment was this ancestry thing free, and if so what's it called, because I've been trying to find one for years, my point in the end is, if someone tried to invade England many countries would be on the fence, especially New Zealand, and members of the commonwealth.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Actully Isreal didnt invande any country at all at 1948... the UN decided To have two countries in the region that was known as Palastin (It was contalled By the united kingdom at the time who was told by the UN to Make prepretions to make it ready for a state) One Jewish Country... One Arabic country.. Obesely the jewish agreed and the arabs didnt.. the Arabs reasoning was that they want the whole land for themselfs while ignoring the 600k Jaws who allready lived there for like 100 years  and actully Was acting like an indepnence country anyways Just without any world wide Recgension of it being a country(ever since like the 19th century...) And baiscly the arabs natives started the war also known as the Indepence war for isreal or freedom War and for arabs the \textbf{black} or doom war (cant really recall the name..) also The arabic countries Also stayed that when isarel annonces its indepence they will attack aswell... In the end isarel meneged to actully win the war in a really suprising matter..this win.. this victory caused three things.. First is that the arab natives desiceded to call themselfs "palastiens" To have a Releted connection to the region even tho before like the 1930s They didnt really want country and they were effect by Jewish Idea to indepence Hench why the native arabs had \textbf{Zero} to no things ready to actully annonce a country and infact they didnt even have an actual grovement or an officel  army like isarel had when it formed... wich brings me to the reason.. Cuz The arabs native didnt really prepred anything to make a country and refused the UN deal many of them started to actully thier homes And run way to jorden Or other countries around (hench why jorden got 2-3m Palastines In it...and also there are like 1m refugess who are palastines becuse of it)  but they were told to stay By The  Presdient of egypt...Claiming they will conquer isreal in eas.. ofc eventully it didnt happend and Egypt baiscly started spreading shit all over the place wich caused people to either do a \textbf{terrorist} attacks.. or flee thier homes. Also those who had famliy reltives who coundecded terror attacks Were actully benished form isarel (but lets be honest those arent realy Many more like 2 of the \textbf{refugee})  and at last it what brought us to our last point wich is becuse of that refuse and The like 4 other denys with leaders and islamic extermies That fual hate and call for terror attacks and a gensoid to the jewish people (reasoning never being officaly stated but many who did answer that question said cuz the jewish are differnt and In the Koren all none musliams must die means jews must die , pretty exterme and raicest openion kinda like hitlar just In a musliam version...) brings Us To the  reality of the present that there is No Palastien Country Gaza being contralled by a terror group known as Hames (UN considers them as \textbf{terrorist} so...) The Palastien Grovement(what was formed In the last 70 years that is..) is actully diveded into Two that are fighting each other meaning there isnt even  a dived fornt or The same openiom at the matter and if a palastien state will be made tomorow there wont be any peace at the region and actully more issues then before...and Gaza Cvilains being stuck Beatwen hammer And An anvill as the Palastien indepence group Take all Money there and starve them to death and Isarel is forced to responce some how to Hamch bullshit all-day and since isarel is like Only Live line for them (they provide gaza all its matrials... tons of food Building matrails And Medecions and ofc Hamash quite leitrery take it all) Mostly its getting fucked up with this trio..  now is it isarel Fault? Did isarel invaded and take arabs lands? No.. Cuz isarel wasnt a country till 1949 and the arabs refused and dose that Nowdays aswell..all the recent events are  caused by those same power games and fights  In the Palastianien leadership..\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Refugee, Terrorist, Zero & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black, Nationality - General, Religious Identity - Muslim & \cellcolor{green!27}5/688 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.727 \\  \hline

And it came to pass and it happened, because this land the true owner of this land is the jews and not the Arabs, God didn't give this land to the descendants of Ishmael, but to the descendants of Isaac, through Jacob (Israel) which God changed his name.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Hydra Gamer yeah ive heard of them, three Abrahamic religions, Judaism, Muslims and Christians. But that is not what God or Christ teaches, that three religions are had the same God, if i tell you this you wouldn't even believe me, about God, Christ, Israel, Muslims and Christians. Those who believed that these three religions came from Abraham that's why it is called 3 Abrahamic religions, can continue to believe if they want, it is not a problem, problem is, Muhammad was born 570 ad, Islam hasnt been founded yet, Allah was not discovered or invented yet, while the true one God "yahweh" who created the universe and this world is the real God of Israel, had made a covenant to his righteous man like Abraham, (like noah) and through his son Isaac, and through his son Jacob, and to his twelve sons, the twelve tribes of Israel, and to the \textbf{nation} of Israel, until Christ cames where God sends His beloved son, for them to be redeemed and be saved, because Christ established a church (Matthew 16:18) although not all jews have listened to Christ, and enter his church because they didn't accept him. Jews who only accept the teachings of Moses not Jesus or law of Moses, were at that time still waiting for the true messaih, because Jesus is the real messaih but they won't accept and believe what God has send them because they want a strong messaih warrior like david, who can deliver them from their enemies like the Romans. That's why they didn't accept Jesus the son of God because they don't want a weak messiah but strong messiah. Those who enter Christ church are called Christians, even today, but not all religious groups today are real like the Catholic church, the real Christians today are only those who have followed and obeyed God's teachings and has entered his Christ body or church. After Christ ascended to heaven, leaving his church to the apostles, but after the apostles have lived their time, and died, satan entered and created a false religion, that is thr Catholic church, created by Roman emperor Constantine, killing and hunting all Christians that the apostles have left. The church of Christ was apostate. Judaism was only created by those jews who did not accept Christ teachings and rejected his church.Now even Muslims claimed that they believed they in Abraham or in Abrahams calling, because both believed in one God (monotheism) but the God of Muhammad is different from the God of Israel. Or maybe he thinks Allah and the God of the jews or Israel is the same. Many people believe this, but thoae people who were chosen or called by God knows the truth.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nation & \cellcolor{green!27}Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/456 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.219 \\  \hline

If the USA and Russia got into a shooting war and the US was being beaten but refused to agree to Russia's terms, Russia could choose to launch a land invasion of the states to force the USA to surrender to their terms. This however is most likely a reason why the two nations will never really go to war. In europe, it's entirely possible to quickly invade a country and force a swift resolution. This is impossible for Russia to accomplish. Regardless of how genius Russia's generals are they will still pay easily the highest cost of lives, weapons, and treasure that the world has ever seen to take the States.

Every time the Israelie forces are going to bomb an Arab country is because they have a very good reason too, and each time they order an evacuation and sometimes the families do not listen and Israel can't to anything about it.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small abdulla khalifa: You seriously need to get your "facts right".  All the wars which Israel has fought over the years with its neighbors have never ended with Israel being defeated. In every case, Israel has always kicked ass, much to the embarrassment and dismay of the Arab world.Under the original 1947 UN Partition Plan for the British Mandate of Palestine, soon-to-be-independent Israel was allocated certain territory and borders. Palestine was also given territory and borders. Jerusalem, and the immediate surrounding area, was going to be established as an international city under UN administration. Immediately after Israel's independence in 1948, the Arab neighbors attacked and landed up losing about 60 of the land that was allocated for Palestine. As a result, Israel became much larger than what was established under the 1947 Partition Plan. Palestine suffered loss of statehood and its remaining territory was absorbed by Egypt and Jordan. Israel also annexed Jerusalem, except for the \textbf{Old} City which remained under Jordanian control.At the beginning of June 1967 Israel was attacked by its Arab neighbors. Israel seized and occupied the Sinai and Gaza from Egypt, the Golan Heights from Syria, and the West Bank (including the \textbf{Old} City of Jerusalem) from Jordan. They accomplished this in less than one week in what is called the "Six Day War". Seizing the territories from Egypt and Jordan is how Israel landed up controlling former Palestinian territory and inheriting the "Palestinian Problem".  At the moment both Egypt and Jordan have peace treaties and official diplomatic relations with Israel. Lebanon has an unofficial peace treaty with Israel.Again, you need to study history so you actually know what really happened and not spout what you've been told are "facts".\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}2/286 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.699 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small An unlawful combatant, illegal combatant or unprivileged combatant/belligerent is a person who directly engages in armed conflict in violation of the laws of war. An unlawful combatant may be detained or prosecuted under the domestic law of the detaining state for such action, subject to international treaties on justice and human rights.[1]The law of war is a legal term of art that refers to the aspect of public international law concerning acceptable justifications to engage in war (jus ad bellum) and the limits to acceptable wartime conduct (jus in bello or international humanitarian law).War is a state of armed conflict between states or societies. It is generally characterized by extreme aggression, destruction, and mortality, using regular or irregular military forcesThe words "regular" and "irregular" have been used to describe combat forces for hundreds of years, usually with little ambiguity. Due to a government's chain of command requirements, the regular army is very well defined, and anybody fighting outside of that (excluding official paramilitary forces) are irregulars. In cases where the legitimacy of the army or its opponents is questioned, some legal definitions have been created.In international humanitarian law, "irregular forces" refers to a category of combatants consisting of individuals forming part of the armed forces of a party to an armed conflict, international or non-international, but not belonging to that party's regular forces and operating in or outside of their own territory even if the territory is under occupation.[1]The Third Geneva Convention of 1949, uses "regular armed forces" as a critical distinction. The International Committee of the \textbf{R\textbf{ed}} Cross (ICRC) is a non-governmental organization primarily responsible for, and most closely associated with, the drafting and successful completion of the Third Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War ("GPW"). The ICRC provided commentary saying that "regular armed forces" satisfy four Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907) (Hague IV) conditions.[2] In other words, "regular forces" must satisfy the following criteria:    being commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates to a party of conflict    having a fixed distinctive emblem recognizable at a distance    carrying arms openly    conducting operations in accordance with the laws and customs of warBy extension, combat forces that do not satisfy these criteria are termed "irregular forces".   names for irregular military formations    Auxiliaries    Levies     Privateer     Revolutionary    Guerrilla    Franc-tireur    Ordenanças     Partisan     Freedom fighter     Paramilitary     \textbf{Terrorist}     Insurgent In short.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I will add that in its short existence, the US has been at war more than any other country so our experience also is added to the factors. With the fact that our first war was to defeat the most military minded country in the world, Great Britain, that says something about our character. We invented gorilla war fare. We have always been at the top of technology. On top of that, there are basically six directions to possibly attack from. Three are the sea and many miles to travel through to get there. The air is next. How are you going to get through the air without the sea.Even so our navy and air force are the most advanced in the world. We would be fighting you from our living rooms with drones for quite a while. By the time you could dream of a plan, we would have a robotic army ready to attack. Our subs and air craft carriers are pretty much everywhere. Our war time industrial power is constantly operational. Our coasts are both lined with mountain ranges where mostly \textbf{crazy} people who shoot guns better than our military live. Deer hunting is their national sport. Everybody has camouflage and guns. Our south is lined with Texas. Then there is Mexico. If you just mention you want directions to the US, they will shoot you. If you go through Canada, you will probably get directed to a marijuana dispensery, get eaten by grizzly bears or freeze to death. That whole path from the north is mostly lined by very large lakes that are so deep, ships have sunk and never been found. If you somehow bypass that, you will be in territories that rain most days out of the year. If you come through any heavy populated areas, you will be stuck in traffic all day. And the people... when a war stops, thats when we shine, we get to all stop fighting with each other and have a \textbf{common} enemy. American pride then jumps to the forefront. We have everybody here who came from intelligent people \textbf{crazy} enough to leave their lands, from the Irish, English, German, Mexican, Latino, \textbf{African}, Italian, Russian, Chinese, Japanese (I'm sure I missed a few) who unite over a \textbf{common} goal of kicking your ass.

While the main battles was with Egypt, Israel fought with Jordan, Syria, and the Palestine Liberation Organization on the same time.Yom Kippur War – Israel fought against Egypt, Syria, Iraq, and Jordan few other countries sent troops to help the Arabs like Libya, Morocco and more. The Arab states were supported and armed by the Soviet Union, while Israel was supported by the United States.From those wars and on Israel army was built from self-made weapons and IDF became one of the greatest armies in the world.

After the last exile our people were dispersed throughout the world and subjected to repeated harassment, so it is not clear to me what kind of victory you claim to be for Muslims. Even though every generation is standing against us to destroy us, God save us. How are you Muslims better than your predecessors? Enlightened and efficient than the Germans? Crueler than the Cossacks? More religious than the Crusaders? Organized as Romans? With more culture than the Greeks? Want me to continue? How exactly do a bunch of kids with AK and a motorcycle dare to challenge God himself?!I see that this discussion deviated from its source regarding the State of Israel and shifted to the topic of religions, where there is no doubt that Islam, which only bought wars and death from its establishment, has an advantage, unlike the Jews, where ever they are , there is morality, development, wealth, science, etc.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!27}1/218 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.459 \\  \hline

And Britain decided it would be best for both Jews and Arabs WHO ARE BOTH THE ORGINAL SETTLERS OF THE FCKING LAND to make two independent states. Palestine were given multiple deals that favored them, and they still declined... Israel fought off and even gained land from the countries they fought with like the Suez Canal and the Gaza Bank, and they still gave it back, how is Israel denying human rights when they are literally trying to make peace???? They reason why is because Palestine still revolted for absolute rule, which kicks out all Jews. IS THIS WHAT YOU CALL HUMAN RIGHTS????? I get Israel has killed a shit ton of Palestinians and that's not fcking good either, but the only way is to share that land if u don't want anymore Palestinians dying.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small sivan suresh, There is an acceptable reason behind why India and China has such a huge population, and that is because of its rich land for agriculture, role in international marketing in history, and ancient civilization.By the way, the calculations that you said are wrong. India's population is 1.324 billion(agreeing the fact that it was approx. 300million in 1940s). India's literacy rate has increased from 12 in 1947 to 74 in 2011, with kerala being the state with a literacy rate of 95(which is actually higher than many developed countries). Thus, this shows that india's literacy rate has drastically improved with a \textbf{hike} over the past 70 years.Well, there is \textbf{nothing} like perfect, but when you always go through the statistics of \textbf{indian}(or any country's) politics and crimes, after independence, you can definitely find that the crime rates and correption are reducing slowly. You won't find any country in the world without a dark side. All you need to do is to work for your country and the rest of the planet, with a hope.I'm a mechanical engineer. To a mechanical engineer, carnot engine(something that cannot be made in real world) is always a dream to invent. Whenever an engine(let it be any engine) is manufactured, \textbf{engineers} compare it with a theoretical Carnot engine, to know how similar they are. Even though we know that Carnot engine is not possible, still we try to achieve carnot engine's efficiency. That's called hope, the thirst to become the best, and then better than the best. What I mean to say is, all those other countries where ones like India in terms of productivity and efficiency. They worked hard to make the most out of them and to earn that so called reputation. Just like that, india is also improving(as you can see that mathematically too). How kerala achieved such a good literacy rate? Did they got independence earlier than other states did? NO!.... It's the attitude that they keep up among them and shared it to their next generations. Speaking of Kerala, I also noted that Kerala is the least correpted state in India. Aren't they indians? They were also at the same level of other states in 1947, still they managed to rank 1st in education, health, politics and standard of living. Keep in mind that kerala's ranking itself even stands higher than a few developed countries too. So, its not the history that speaks the future, but, its the present .\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Engineers, Hike, Indian, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Native-American, Nationality - General, Nationality - Italian & \cellcolor{green!27}4/414 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.966 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Justin Mathew Does this literacy rate of 74 includes school-dropouts and people those who could barely sign their names instead of using their thumb impression? My idea of education is that atleast, people have finished up their high schools, could read books, newspapers, exposed to newer ideas and social changes. I don't know what to say about Kerala. Much of Kerala is working in gulf countries and as hospital nurses all over India. Kerala's economy is often dubbed as 'Money Order Economy'. Few major corporations and manufacturing plants are headquartered in Kerala. Cleaning toilets of Arabs is not how i describe success story. When I think about developed country, I picture heavily industrialised and economically dominating Germany as an ideal \textbf{nation} to follow.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small sivan suresh, //Justin Mathew Does this literacy rate of 74 includes school-dropouts and people those who could barely..../   I don't know. Anyway, 12 and 74 are calculated with the same criterias. What we can notice is a big change between \textbf{old} india and new india in terms of literacy. Something you earlier said as declining.Keralites in gulf countries are 0.1 of country's population. And this 0.1 sents sum of around 15.12 to remittance of india, annually. You know how much is that 15.12? Its 6.5 billion USD per annum. So 0.1 is doing some serious shit there, rather than sitting somewhere and complaining about their own country. Ever heard of these personalities from Kerala? Joy Alukas- the person who has 130 jewelry showrooms in 14 countries including USA. He started his carrier in middle East. Yousaf Ali- a person who makes a turn over of \$7.4 billion annually. Started carrier in middle East.(quick fact: he's the owner of India's largest mall)B. Ravi Pillai- forth most powerful person in middle East. Net worth \$3.5 billion.These are a few among many. You think that they earned this by washing arab's toilets.By the way, you haven't said anything about least correpted state, health, etc. of the state, kerala.So your opinion is, India should become like Germany over a night?Because I already told you how India is developing and improving itself. You didn't say anything about it.Germany's GDP - 3.467 trillion USDIndia's GDP - 2.264 trillion USDBritain's GDP - 2.619 trillion USDAustralia's GDP - 1.205 trillion USDCanada's GDP - 1.53 trillion USDThis shows that india is already near to developed countries in terms of economy. 1st question: why India should become like Germany when India has her own carrier to follow? 2nd question: If Germany is the ideal country, then why not other countries following it?\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}1/314 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.318 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small It's all well and good until the children start requesting the UK to be on this list. The amount of incorrect WW2 statements is terrifying. Firstly if we're gonna debate the UK being on this list we have to ignore all previous historical invasions and defences as has been done for many countries on this list. Forget 1066, forget WW2, just think about the modern day British military. The modern day British military is drafted at a low standard but trained to some of the (if not the) highest standards in the world. However numerically that military isn't large and nor is the vehicular count bar naval warships. Now of course a defence of Britain would mostly be done by air and sea, where most countries probably couldn't surpass us except those with sheer weight of numbers. We also posses warships with anti-missile capabilities as well, so breaking the iron naval barrier would be a hard step. However, if a land army did hit the shores that is where things get unpredictable and interesting. Britain is one of the biggest arms dealers in the world, we produce a LOT of weaponry, so supplies would likely not become choked at any stage from any angle. The terrain of the UK is largely flat meaning long range combat with a focus on armoured/mechanised warfare until a city is reached. Cities in the UK are fairly tightly built, most towns being only half an hour from another town, so urban combat would also be \textbf{common}. There is no known land based defence system in the UK, so not much more to analyse. I imagine it simply comes down to numbers being the core weakness and fairly simple weather and flat ground. Large countries with modern technology like the US, Russia, China and India would probably overpower us in a single country vs country war. But the greatest strength of Britain is that it would never become a single country vs country war. Also as history has proven time and again, Britain is more likely to be the invader rather than the invaded.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Common & \cellcolor{green!27}Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}1/349 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.287 \\  \hline

That whole religion  or cult I should say was messed from the very start. Even from Muhammed's death every muslim has been killing each other and fighting over who Muhammed successor would be lol.

It's just that it'd be to costly to do so for what you get or it'll assure your own destruction.

US could invade Iran or North Korea on their own and win, but it'd take to much time, american lives, resources and effort. It'll also weaken them, risk a potential nuclear retaliation, probably end in a withdrawal like Vietnam due to americans themselves beeing fed up before the work is finished and they'd gain almost \textbf{nothing} from it.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Well, they attempted to. And failed, if you remember well. I don't think Iran would be impossible to invade, it would just be a though nut to crack. If you look at WWII, countries on both sides put incredible efforts into winning. Total war and all that. If powerful nations (at this point, let's say the USA) absolutely wanted to take over Iran for some reason, they could. It just wouldn't be a walk in the park like, say, the war in Irak was. It's a matter of how determined they would be. The video is a bit confusing, using too different reasons to justify putting a country on the list. Israel has too good an army and was undefeated previously? Well...but its army had been facing subpar adversaries. So, it depends on who is doing the invading. And there's no guarantee that even its neighbours won't in the future become much more militarily powerful. At which point it becomes very "invadable" because it's a tiny country whose army can't exactly withdraw by 100 kms and regroup to fight another day. Switzerland cannot be invaded because all its neighbours are allied? OK, but that too is circumstantial. They might not be 50 years down the road. And even though their army and defense system is thought highly of, it has never been tested. If, say, Germany had attempted an invasion in the 40s, it might have proved much easier than some believe. We just can't know. Also, by this reasoning, Luxembourg can't be invaded either, since it has only allies around it. But in fact, it would take probably a couple hours to invade it if someone wanted to. Bhutan can't be invaded because it benefits from \textbf{Indian} protection? What if it was India that wanted to annex it?

She is not, without the massive help from the WEST, can defend herself, period. Thanks to the United WEST's help and fragmented Arabs, Israel can laugh and enjoy. Iran is a big and strong country. Its Armed Forces have fought real Battles for 8 years without any help from any one. At the last reliable count, she has 10,000 long-range Missiles that can reach Israel in no time. Even if she fires only 10 and 90 of them were intercepted, that still leaves 100 Missiles to make Israel a cauldron, especially if they are directed towards the Capital. BTW, most of the Israeli Anti Missile Umbrella is devoted to protect its Nuclear Assets. There is no way Israeli Umbrella can protect the whole country. I am not advocating a war between Iran and Israel. Israel has real problems with its Orthodox Jewish Community: Neturei Karta that regards Israel an abomination on Jewish Faith and advocates its destruction for the reason that only Meshiach  Messiah from the lineage of David shall establish Erzet Yisraaeel and rebuild the Sacred Temple.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small i don't know how it is today, but atleast in my generation, the Egyptian education system was very biased against Israel, as are the European education systems. many children in those countries were taught the the Sinai was retaken in an Egyptian military victory rather than given for peace; they learn that there was a Palestinian country before the Zionist Usurped them, both of which are false.The Palestinians are not indigenous to Israel, most of them did not even call themselves "Palestinians" until after the 67 war.as for the lack of peace, 3 different Israeli Prime Ministers offered the Palestinians what they wanted, but were always met with more violence, and more excuses.let me tell you something interesting: when the PLO was created in 1964, their charter for what they listed as "Palestine"included all of Israel EXCEPT for the Gaza strip, Judea, and Samara, which were under Egyptian and Jordanian control. they didn't even have any demands on east Jerusalem! only AFTER these territories came under Jewish control in 1967, the PLO actually went and CHANGED their charter, to include all of the land that was now Israel.in other words, if an Israeli purchased an island, in french Polynesia, that that too would automatically become a part of "Palestine"the boarders of "Palestine" are flexible, and redrawn to encircle any land that is under Jewish control.the aim of the PLO is not to liberate Palestine (which was never a country to begin with) but rather to destroy Israel, which is why their is not a single Palestinian protest against the Heshemites of Jordan, who currently occupy 80 of the mandate. Yasser Arafat, the founder of Fatah (who was actually born in Cairo, Egypt) said the following "the end of Israel is the goal of our struggle, it allows for neither compromise nor meditation... we do not want peace, we want war, victory! peace for us means the destruction of Israel, and \textbf{nothing} else"and of course, while the "moderate" PLOs charter does indeed call for the destruction of Israel, it still is not quite as bad as Hamas, who do not only call for the destruction of Israel, but the genocide of Jews worldwide!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}1/369 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.271 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Ahmad Kamal lol, read the history, Israel didn't lose at the 2006 Lebanon war, the results are stalemate. Cuz both claimed victory.Date: 12 July – 14 August 2006(Israeli blockade of Lebanon ended on 8 September 2006)Location: Lebanon, Northern Israel and the Golan HeightsResult: Stalemate,both sides claim victoryCeasefire through UNSC Resolution 1701The Lebanese Army is introduced into South Lebanon and UNIFIL deployments reinforced.None of their objectives met? The conventional first impression was that Hezbollah won the war by surviving and demonstrating that it had the will and the capability to fight Israel to a standoff. But the emerging 'big picture' suggests Hezbollah was seriously damaged both physically and politically and that while Israel did not achieve the decisive victory many expected, it did improve its strategic position.Although Israel could not prevent the launching of missiles, it did severely degrade Hezbollah capabilities. The majority of the long-range missiles and a partial stock of Hezbollah's Katyusha rockets were destroyed. In fact, after the war it was disclosed that the Israeli Air Force destroyed 59 intermediate and long-range missile launchers during a 34-minute raid on the second day of the war. The July 13 strike on Iranian-made Zelzal and Fajr missiles prevented Hezbollah from carrying out its threats to attack central Israel.Another positive outcome of the war was to further weaken Syrian influence in the country, which was partly exercised through Hezbollah. It also reduced Syria's ability to threaten Israel indirectly through its Lebanese proxy.To the extent Hezbollah is viewed as having lost the war, it also represents a defeat for Iran, which armed, financed and trained its \textbf{terrorist} army.Wrong they didn't lost many tanks, only 5 tanks were damaged.Still the casualties are many from Arabs than jews. So whatever you say about this war is always fucking wrong.Ten years after last Lebanon war, Israel warns next one will be far worse.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Daniel Brotskiy, your list is based on a different premise than Alltime10s list of hardest countries to invade because it is based on countries that have been historically hardest to invade rather than what is now the case, however it is not historically accurate as though you claim it to be based on the last 300 years nor is it a fair comparison to begin with. First of all, Russia when it was invaded by France in 1812, France captured Moscow in the Battle of Borodino with less guns and after marching 575 miles (912 km) and Russia was a fully developed world power. When Britain burnt Washington in 1814, two years later it was undefended, and they - the British were forced to abandoned the capital city by a severe storm with a tornado that tossed canons, damaged ships, and killed British soldiers, also the invasion was later repulsed at Baltimore by an American coastal fort. France's invasion of Russia wasn't repulsed and the British didn't march hundreds of miles like the French, they simply bullied there seasoned soldiers and Royal Marines onto shore with the world's biggest navy who fought militia who still inflicted more casualties on the British invaders. America was only around thirty years \textbf{old}, Russia started as Kievan Rus' in 882 and over three hundred years later in 1240 it was completely conquered by the Mongolian Empire. The biggest empire in the world couldn't conquer America when it was first established in 1776 and America hasn't even existed for 300 years. Actually it's funny you should use the burning of Washington as a reason to put Russia ahead of America on the list when Moscow has been captured and sacked dozens of times throughout history, e.i: Siege of Moscow (1382), Fire of Moscow (1571), Lithuanian–Commonwealth occupies Moscow from 1610 to 1612, Battle of Borodino, ...etc. Another thing, you call Americans "shitty warriors" based on America's wars with Afghanistan and Vietnam. First, those are invasions and Russia has failed more invasions, one you mentioned - Finland, and lost a war in Afghanistan, America hasn't. During the Russian Civil War, America deployed troops in Russia to fight the \textbf{R\textbf{ed}} Army. The Americans won 6/8 battles and inflicted more casualties on the Russians while outnumbered. Furthermore, you put Japan ahead of America even though the US Navy captured Okinawa, Japan's southern most island in 1944. China shouldn't be on the list at all, especially if you are going by the last 300 years since much of China was conquered by Japan in 1940 and all of the Chinese dynasties were conquered by the Mongolians before that. America is the hardest country to invade historically because it is the only country that hasn't been conquered.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Old, Red & \cellcolor{green!5} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - Native-American & \cellcolor{green!5}3/456 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.658 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small firstly fosters brewed in other countries actually tastes better.. we think its the water.Australia should not be on this list.. the Aussie military has a few strong points namely a small amount of elite military sas and a handful of next gen fighters and ace pilots sadly though these cannot compensate for the extremely low military budget and even worse military planing. the ol desert argument is very tired and outdated. nowadays military's have infared/night vision, combined with spy satellites its pretty hard to hid anywhere short of an underground lead walled bunker. and here is other reason why Australia shouldn't be on the list. the Australian coast line is 25,760 km long its so large that Australia's meagre air force and navy combined cannot patrol it effectively and have to fill in the gaps with UAV's. knowing this the budget is still spent stupidly on things that aren't needed like tactical destroyers and heli carriers and pointless military tech. swat teams are better armed then most reserve troops which make up a large amount of Australia fighting force. your average american \textbf{yokel} has a modular assault rifle and is better armed... even insurgents are using ak' variants and are better armed. instead of turning the navy into an air power buying up \textbf{old} carriers and pre gen jets. quantity has a quality all of its own. countries like Israel and India that were buying up ex-gen fighters now have enough design know how to develop and build there own and Australia spins its wheels trying to keep a quickly \textbf{ageing} concept like navy relevant instead of turning itself into a air superpower. the number of carriers by country is 1/2 across a small handful of countries and the US has 11 with 40+ in reserve or decommissioned.and they are currently replacing their super carriers with next gen super carriers. why? because carrier groups are extremely effective. Australia wouldn't put up much of a fight vs a country like north Korea. even though their tech is extremely \textbf{old} and there troops are starving. they are conditioned by the hardship they live as well as from the propaganda they are brainwashed with. with a large enough amount of fighters and tanks they could easily overpower any defence made.the only hope Australia has to defend its boarders is an implementation of naval air power, carrier groups patrolling each coast ready to intercept "problems" before they land. i live in Australia and im not being un patriotic, just realistic. its impossible to make the military budget for army navy and air force stretch and protect our boarders effectively so isn't it realistic to cannibalise the weak link?

All parties knew these figures had \textbf{NOTHING} to do with missiles in Cuba at the time but everything to do with the readiness of the people. It was THIS reality that forced Kennedy to negotiate an end to the crisis .In commemoration of the 40th anniversary of the crisis, Robert McNamra, U.S secretary of Defense (?) at the time went to a conference in Havana and acknowledged much of this.   During the 2000's (2004 I believe), Cuba had one of its occasional nationwide drills (the NY Times reported on it);  4,000,000 people showed up alongside the regular army. People KNEW it was just a drill so some in fact did not show. What it CLEARLY indicated is that Cuba's army has largely been and continues to be A PEOPLE'S ARMY.  When reporting on the number of deaths within the first year of a U.S invasion,  U.S. officials assessed about 20,000 deaths within the first year.  a smaller  than during the missile crisis but CLEARLY a high number that would cause a serious political crisis here in the U.S.  Cuban officials say that the death toll would be even higher but both sides agree (though the U.S doing so more quietly perhaps) that it is the  willingness of the Cuban people to defend their society, combined with the people being highly organized to do so,  that continues to be its strongest weapon.  Incidentally,  It WAS primarily CUBA, along with Angola and Namibia that handed defeat to the army of apartheid S. Africa,  one of the most  powerful armies on earth, during the 80's (all parties knew that RUSSIA'S assistance was INSIGNIFICANT, at best.] See the book Visions of Freedom, by Piero Glijeses.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!27}1/359 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.279 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Chloe wilson I'm confused. Why is Israel bad if while all of the Muslim and Arab people who live in Israel can run for parliament just as much as a Jew can, Jews are persecuted in other Muslim countries. What you people want is to destroy the Jewish people. What you want is something no one has ever gotten. After WW 2, and after England gave Palestine and made it Israel, the Palestinians were forced to leave. Other races, the Jews, for example were forced out of there homes, but they never got them back. In fact, while angry, they never tried to take back there homes, for it is impossible. The only reason these people don't want Israel is because it is portrayed as the symbol of the Jews. In today's modern day and \textbf{age}, you guys can't say "Let's go kill all the Jews" so instead you say "Let's try to force other countries to get rid  of Israel and make them charge all the Jews in them for committing 'War Crimes'" your reasoning is not logical. If anyone but the Jews got Israel, trust me the Palestinians wouldn't be so angry.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/194 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.515 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small It really isn't feasible to invade any first world country in the modern era I don't think. Your Finland's your Canada's your Sweden's your Britain's your Frances. Ok maybe France is a stretch on any list. Just Kidding Frenchie. I love France and would be first in line to fight there if you needed a hand. But I would have thought it would be really tough to invade Syria.  Not first world, but formidable none the same. Granted it began with internal strife i.e a civil war. But when it comes to America no one would want to invade. The proposition and logistics involved are too much to fathom. According to CRS there are upwards of 300,000,000 guns in 60,000,000 private hands in the US. 5 in my safe alone. And most of that 60,000,000 would repel any invader without a second thought. As well as there is upwards of 1,000,000,000,000 rounds in private hands. Yes that is 1 trillion. I have about 7,200 rounds in 4 calibers alone. Though I rarely shoot anymore. The US is a gun culture, for good or for bad. We could only ever be defeated with nuclear attack. God forbid. But that isn't the premise after all so I didn't mention that. In purely conventional terms, only two countries on the earth could invade and remotely hope to have success. China or Russia. But as I stated in the beginning I think that type of warfare is long past. Early warning systems would catch any land air or sea invasion force long before it was able to strike any of the country's I mentioned. Yes including France. Then there is our military. All 5 branches have over 2,000,000 men and women.

And a whole big gob of row boats. Lota row boats. We also have 38,000,000,000 bbl of proven oil reserve and 727,000,000 bbl in strategic reserve. 6,500,000 miles of road to move man and material. 323,000,000 people 13,000 serviceable airports and 224,000 miles of railway.

The network of viaducts and ring roads enables the Jewish settlers to bypass Palestinian-controlled territory and connect to Israel (and vice-versa). However, the land is not Israel.

And, my sweet mate, you admitted that the terrorists from the west who helped form the illegal \textbf{nation} called Israel, did expel innocent Arab citizens of Palestine. And you have no idea what Allahu-Akbar means. Again, do some homework, try to understand Islam.

They often get no enough  amenities, healthcare, education, and job opportunity. The illegal \textbf{nation} oppresses them. And they don't give a damn to the declarations of the UN that condemns their wrongdoings.   The slanders of Dajjal has been said by the Prophet Muhammad(PBUH) 1400 years ago. It is clearly abundant now, especially in the middle east. The illegal \textbf{nation} will not stop until Muslims leave the true faith and follow their's. ISIS is one of their efforts to continue tarnishing the image of Islam. They deceive certain Muslims to believe in their path of fighting. This brings to the recruitment of Muslims. The slanders has begin to work in certain quarters.   Allahu Akbar means Allah is The Greatest. Other misunderstood word is Jihad which means striving or struggling with a praiseworthy aim. Know the meanings before you talk. People misunderstand, that leads to faulty thoughts.  People also get deceived easily by the media. And the media is not controlled by Muslims.  Have you been to my country? How did you think that my country is less modern than your's?   No, No one thought me about hating Israel. The wrongdoings of the zionists made me think, and do some research. Recently, Mahmood Abbas said that the Israeli government is practicing apartheid law!

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Mike \textbf{Black} bruh if you do that to any country you'd have a major disadvantage. But Actually we'd still have a great chance. Because we'd pull everything back to main land America and have 1,300,00 active military personnel on top of another 800,000 reserve personnel not including more than 1.1 million law informant officers and about 300 million private gun owners some having more than one gun. All I'm sure defending against a invasion. Also if you take a look at American Geography. A good portion of he US is covered in mountainous land making hard to invade out posts of military and private people. Not to include massive deserts. Also let's not forget. The US has military bases all over the world. Thousands upon thousands of military vehicles would not be affected by the EMP. Even most submarines off are coast wouldn't even be affected by a EMP (depending on how deep they are because water is could at reflecting EMPs) and not mention THOUSANDS of everyday cars not affected, that I'm sure the military would seize as many and modify as many as possible to there advantage and plus the thousands of military and/or civilian vehicles made during the early 1900's that wouldn't be affected by EMP and would be recommissioned for fighting purposes. Not to include if are neighbors to the north wanted to help we'd have a huge advantage. So yes ANY ANY ANY country hit by a EMP would be affected horribly but not every country could still defend against a invasion and I'm pretty sure America could STILL even after being hit by a EMP could defend itself against a invasion.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small There you go, my Turkish friend:  Vlad's cruelty is well documented in historical texts, but what often goes overlooked is how he combined this cruelty with cunning to terrorize his enemies.For example, his preferred method of execution, impalement, wasn't just a sadistic way to get rid of his opponents; it was also a good way to scare them away, according to Curta.In 1462, Mehmet II (at the time, the Ottoman sultan), invaded Wallachia. When he arrived at the capital city of Târgoviște, he found it deserted. The rotting remains of Ottoman prisoners of war, each impaled on a \textbf{spike}, were the only soldiers there to greet him. Mehmet didn't retreat right then and there, but he certainly didn't gain any headway, Curta noted.This painting, "Vlad the Impaler and the Turkish Envoys," by Theodor Aman (1831-1891), allegedly depicts a scene in which Vlad III nails the turbans of these Ottoman diplomats to their heads.This painting, "Vlad the Impaler and the Turkish Envoys," by Theodor Aman (1831-1891), allegedly depicts a scene in which Vlad III nails the turbans of these Ottoman diplomats to their heads.Credit: Public domainAt one point during Mehmet's campaign to conquer Wallachia, Vlad III dressed his soldiers in Ottoman garb and led them on a midnight raid of the sultan's camp. Their goal was to kill the sultan as he slept in his tent — a goal they failed to accomplish. However, they did succeed in creating mass confusion among the Ottoman soldiers, according to Curta. The Ottomans stayed up until morning, slaughtering one another in the belief that their comrades were really the enemy in Turkish clothing."Impaling was used as a form of terror— to terrorize the enemy coming to invade one's country," Curta said. "He had to do a lot of things with very limited resources. He actually used efficient methods to fight against his enemy without having that many men at his disposal."Miller echoed that sentiment, noting that many historians have labeled Vlad's tactics against the Ottomans as "psychological warfare." In other words, these historians believe that the notorious Dracula may not have been exceptionally cruel, but rather doing what he had to do to fight a military force much greater than his own.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Spike & \cellcolor{green!27}Religious Identity - Protestant & \cellcolor{green!27}1/376 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.266 \\  \hline

I can visit cairo any day and israel supplies water and food to jordan, also palestine doesnt exist and it doesnt want to, we tryed giving up the land we have got in 1967 and make a palestinian state numerous times (1978, 1993, 1995, 2000, 2008 just to name a few!) also even if we attacked your country we didnt do anything bad to you or your familly, our army has the most civilan deaths saved than any other in the world, people in gaza live on places that ahamas knows bombs will fall, so in the recent operation in 2014 we actually called people living in gaza and told them to evacuate because there is no rocket defending system in gaza, not even a siren!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Dumb & \cellcolor{green!5}Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}1/241 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.415 \\  \hline

Also all of the arab population in israel are happier and actually getting support from the goverment at conflict times, because arab countrys encourage arabs to move back to their countrys, while israel is incouroging jews that live in terrorists zones to come here, do you have proof that israel raped \textbf{woman}? Also israel is not a person, ita 8 million people... There will be criminals and there will be rapers but they dont actually care that thats a palestinian or not, actually... Tecniclly they do...

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small In most cases these technologically advanced weapons need real man to stand behind them, in 1939 when Italy invaded Ethiopia with tanks and fighter aircraft the barely armed and organized Ethiopian Militias fought 5 straight years bare hand and defeated the technologically advanced Italian military! Here in the US we have everything it take to fight any war minus the human resource! In near-future I doubt if we can fulfill our recruitment requirements for every branch of our military. As a combat veteran myself I can come up with at least 3 top reasons why it will be hard to fill vacancies in the future military rank. 1- Comparing to most of other nations, Americans care a lot less about their country, and more about what their country can offer them.2-Health, nutrition, and education: These 3 are somewhat related to one another, quality of what we feed our society pays off at every stage, American food industry is NEVER about quality of life, never about keeping our society healthy; rather it's about profit , about getting richer and richer at cost of citizens health and very future. If one is not healthy enough their productivity is less likely comparing to those who are healthy, productivity includes ability to peruse education and career.3- Lack of \textbf{nationalism} at top political levels, Almost every politician we elect at every level can sell us to the highest bidder without due process, political offices are like a money cow for every politician, they seek power to serve their greed and that of very few rich, similarly with our food chain what comes out of our politicians mouth could be very dangerous or very useful to the society as it spreads faster than anything else. There are many other valid points to make but no time is enough.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nationalism & \cellcolor{green!5}Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/304 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.329 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Robertski82 I am sure you believed you were standing up for what's right. I wish more people, especially those from the west (because I don't expect this from brainwashed Muslims) got a little bit more knowledge before they put down the only western democracy in the Middle East. Even Kasim Hafeez, who was a Pakistani radical Islamist, anti-Semite, anti-Zionist went on a trip to Israel just to find that the state of "apartheid", "genocide" and "\textbf{ethnic} cleansing" was a perfect example of democracy, where you can find synagogues, mosques, and churches in the same city. Where Jews and Arabs live together in peace. almost a quarter (roughly 2 million) of Israel's population is Arab. That is equal to about half of Palestine's population, including both West Bank and Gaza strip (and how many Jews are there in Palestine???). Those are the Arabs who chose to live a peaceful life in a country that has shown incredible growth in 70 years from a piece of desert to a leader in science, technology and health care. They are citizens with full rights (in fact, more rights than Jews, because they get to choose whether to serve in the military. Jews are forced to serve). The Arabs who live in so called "Palestine" are the ones who chose to fight, and look at their growth in 70 years - the only "achievements" of Gaza Strip are even stronger rockets and even deeper tunnels. Not a penny is invested in their citizens. Water and electricity comes from my city of Ashkelon. Trucks with free food and medication enter their gates every morning. Jobs are secured (yes they obviously need to go through screening, but Israel provides them with jobs). During the operations when they used to bomb my neighborhood, my mum was the head nurse of Tel Aviv hospital, taking care of Hamas militants!!!!!!! I am not even joking, it is ridiculous what the world doesn't know! Western people must disregard the anti-Semite media, open their eyes and see the real problem. Jews don't explode, shoot, stab or drive over people in the streets of Berlin, London, Paris, Brussels.... For Israelis this is everyday life, and soon it will be in the rest of the West, so better known which side you're on and take a lesson from Israel on how to defend yourself. If you don't trust my word and you think I'm just another biased Israeli, just take the same trip to Israel that Kasim Hafeez went on. See for yourself. You will be mindblown how the demonized Israel that you see in the news is not any less fictional than Narnia. P.S. I no longer live in Israel. I recently moved to Canada after finishing my 3 years of service. I couldn't stand the idea of building a family under a rain of rockets.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small First of all, Ukraine have not being in war with Russia. Since were discussing missile defenses, what you're saying is that the Russians had their military branch called Strategic Rocket Forces involved in direct actions in Donbass. Which is by the way the only region where you had and to some extend still have military actions. If that was the case, yes Ukraine most likely would have \textbf{nothing} to respond with. Never happened though. And since were on Russia, lets mention their anti missile systems, all the "S" series. 300, 400, 500. or the A-135. In a nutshell, a rocket system, designed to intercept enemy rockets. Same principle used in the Iron Dome with its primary Arrow missiles.  US of A, Patriot, missile's intercepting missiles. Or the naval based RIM interceptor missiles. Last two words says it all again. Current Chinese DF-21, two stage, solid fuel rocket interceptor, aimed at intercepting enemy balistics. Italy, France and the UK, all using system called Aster. Quote: "The Aster missile series, primarily comprising the Aster 15 and Aster 30 are a family of vertically launched surface-to-air missiles" Again, missiles intercepting enemy missiles. Or 'rockets, shooting enemy missiles out of the sky' as it is said in the video. So like I said, literally every country, that has developed own anti missile system and ballistic defenses, does exactly that. Shooting rockets, with their own rockets. And done it long before the Israeli Arrows, part of the Iron Dome was even developed and operational. There is no other way. Apart from all the experimental projects, from clusters, hives and nets, shot  in front of the enemy missile, to the a-la Ronald Reagan "Star wars", along all other non American projects, of destroying enemy missiles with lasers, and other means, none of which is still used. Not yet. No one is discussing if the Iron Dome is a good or bad concept. Its how its presented, sensationalist and as something unheard of. While its the norm and has being for decades.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The list was fun for what its purpose is. I'd like to offer arguments to a few of them, but frankly it would take some pretty incredible efforts to muster.I honestly believe that a 10 year segment designing some new training and battle strategies, and we could make every fortress of Eurasia as easy to beat as Trumps precious wall which even he acknowledged would be beaten with just "A ladder and a rope" to almost use his own words exactly.Sure, the climate of the area the stronger nations are in is pretty fearsome, without a doubt any CURRENT army on Earth would suffer if they so much as thought about attacking Iran. But if we either made treaties with all bordering nations of any potential concern, and made a new-age variant of Israels Iron Dome, it would be impossible for them to retaliate to an attack. Now, that doesn't mean we'd win just for that reason, it's an actual \textbf{nation} and even if it's fairly lacking in some things, it wouldn't be too hard a leap for those people to more or less do a desert mountain version of North Korea, and just make anything they can't buy from a neighbor that's also one of the 3 largest super powers.The real issue, would be my mentioned training regimen.See, we have a lot of places that could be used for skill building. Yes, a number of them are protected and thus we aren't meant to muck them up, but frankly that shold be easy enough to fix even if we damaged bits. We're so in love with Ancient Rome, our money has Latin written on it, and any word that didn't exist in some manner before we decided we needed it, is derived from one or even a complex series of Latin words. Frankly, if ever in the future Earth reaches a point where the very memory of Latin as a language or cultural framing ceases to exist, any word America coined after say.... 1860 is going to sound fucking psychotic. People 800+ years from now (even if they're just looking at our ruins and remnant documents like we do Rome today) who see things like phobias and the names they're given, are going to be even more flabbergasted than Rhett and Link are by the word dufflebag.Anyways, the point was if we love them so goddamn much(Rome), we should fucking take a hint and work our army like ancient legionnaires, and equip them to scale any surface, build any structure, raze any city. We could mark a specific (preferably the least important/most treacherous) bit of land from the Grand Canyon leading into the Colorado Southwest, and simply workshop ways to get past the hardest bits. What to do when scaling massive rocky features at a perfect 90 degree angle. How to preserve, find, filter, and use water in any potentially needed way for in deserts that I'm told are the closest equivalent in the whole US of A to Afghanistan.A second training ground using a complex segment of the Southeast, from the marshes of Florida through Georgian and Louisianan swamps, through just the worst muddiest nastiest areas anywhere nearby we can come up with. Shit. We could even take it a step farther from just army training, and make it some sort of massive nationwide holiday celebrated once per year; a set path marked with some sort of sturdy long-lasting beacons. Things that could be left alone during the rest of the year, and wouldn't hard nature anymore than confusing the fuck our of a bear or two. Specially prepared areas say every 1-3 miles depending on perceived demands and difficulties where people who need to tap out or just get a bit more of a refresher than the tippy top contenders might, and of course some sort of system to monitor the path and give rescue to those who couldn't make it to a safety area.Rather than calling anyone a loser for not completing it, it would just have greater recognition for making it past certain distances. Respect and recognition to anyone who even had the balls to attempt it, overt mention and respect for those who get more than 24 through, all the way to recognizing anyone who actually made it the entire way (REGARDLESS of any need for rest stops, so long as they made it during the event in any time length, with any number of delays. Maybe give it a 3-4 week duration, I donno.) as a fucking national hero. To such an extent that the only people that should be considered more impressive are the people contestants are aspiring to be, such as (save, of course, for contestants who already ARE) Law enforcers, Firefighters, the higher end of EMTs (walking distance from my home is a newly built hospital with 2 helipads. We're at the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, so a very large number of emergency patients at least in comparison to say, a Tennessee hospital are brought in via the Flight for Life. Whenever I see one of the \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} helis in transit, my heart sinks in worry for the person it's mobilized for, at the same time that it soars knowing the people inside the craft intend to safe them no matter where they need to go. No matter what they need to do.) and, of course, Soldiers.I doubt anyone could come up with a reason against this sort of an idea, that doesn't boil down to little more than acknowledging we just do not have the motivation, the unison of will, the strength and inspiration of a properly dedicated leader, to make it happen.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Strongly disagreeing with NK being on the list...Population is poor, poor health, and more. Sure they have nukes, but unless china saves them again, SK, with some, not a lot, of military aid, they could still be invaded. In fact, in the Korean war, they would have been invaded by the US and SK in a short few months if it werent for China. That was back in the 1950's, which is relatively recent compared to the others on the list. Britian, China, Monogolia, Madagascar would have been better alternatives. Now, here's the agruements for each.Last time Britian was invaded, was by the Ancient Roman empire. Its superior naval strength protects this island from invasion. Hittler's attempt at invasion lasted only a couple of months before giving in. Also, it is allies with France, Germany, and the US. (these are just some notables) Unless you want to be nuked, you probably will not invade the country anytime soon.China's mountanous terrien helps against land invasions from the western, and northern sides will help repel a pending invasion. Also, if an invasion does, happen, you can almost count Russia, and North Korea to be on their side. China also has a large army, and its influence spreads through most, if not all of Asia. The closest non-ally powerfull army is an island. (Japan). Unless said invasion has the US's full support (WWIII?), an invasion will not be complete. Let's not forget that they have 1/4 of the world's population in their country. India, which has the 2nd most populated country, is located near a war-happy location, and would not want to start any fight anytime soon, let alone risk spread its army in a possible 2 front war, or 2 different wars.Monogolia, a \textbf{nation} landlocked by China and Russia. This former USSR country will never be invaded due to this reason alone. Also, its mountanous, and climate does no favors to foreign armies. They probably won't need an army either.Madagascar, the only country in Africa that could make the list. While poor, there is little to no reason an invasion will be taking place here. Why? Well, there's virtually no resources to be found here to make it worthwhile.  Its friendly relations with most of Africa would become helpful in widening a war against a pending invasion. With this being said, there is also no nearby \textbf{nation} that would invade Madagascar, let alone has the resources available to do such an invasion.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nation & \cellcolor{green!27}Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/414 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.483 \\  \hline

It's unfortunate that Our soldiers are all over the world fighting conflicts designed by groups that have their own self interests in mind. However, one fortunate effect of all of this skirmishing all over the globe as the so-called "world police", is Our soldiers are more experienced than any other military on Earth. I may be a bit biased as a combat veteran myself, but my logic is still sound.Combine this experience with technological and capability superiority, and I'd have to agree with this video. Any attempted invasion would be soundly thwarted. Albeit a combined effort of China and Russia would cause significant human losses and structural damage. War with either one of those nations individually would be unwelcome, very costly in every way, and should be avoided at all costs.Anyone who has seen, heard, and smelled war up close and personal would tell you it's \textbf{nothing} to glorify, cheer about, or fantasize over.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Israel may have occupied many territories but that is because most of the places they occupy are politically instable and disorderly. For example, Palestine has no real government controlling it and the PLO is extremely corrupt and would probably lose control of Palestine to insurgents and other more extreme \textbf{terrorist} organizations if given complete control of Palestine and the West Bank. Israel is just a situation where both parties are stuck for many reasons. The United States however does not simply invade and occupy other countries. They merely attempted in the past to preserve democratic states in foreign nations such as in Vietnam or invaded Iraq on the premise that there were WMD and that Saddam Hussein was funding \textbf{terrorist} organizations such as Al-Qaeda. Maybe it was not a good idea because of the non existent WMDs or little or fabricated evidence for such things. But America still did topple a dictatorship that had previously invaded Kuwait and used chemical weapons (WMDs) against their own citizens, Iraqi Shiites.

It's the propaganda mind control and chemtrail spraying overhead let you know that, yes, it has already been invaded: by people willing to commit treason to assassinate its president (JFK); and overtake the voting system within; and subvert the truth in a massive counterintel operation of cyber warfare to keep the people in the dark.  Its elections are hacked, by the makers of its voting machines and no one even bothers checking because if you try to have a recount, the supreme court blocks it at the last minute, just in time for some distraction to divert your attention from a real issue.  If you know these things and tell others, they wont believe you anyway.  Some teachers who know the truth will soon be dismissed.  Most teachers are the most brainwashed and unable to put the pieces together because their pathology was incubated within a country whose television repeats huge lies over and over, telling us of a non existent enemy that demolished buildings filled with people so that we may enter into decades of war to clear Israel's enemies' armies from being a threat while US tax payers pay for this rage that Americans cannot even understand.  So if your question is whether it is impossible for America to be invaded, well, you are wrong, it has already been invaded.  That is why we have political figures and celebrities routinely assassinated…. And you thought it was a heart attack, drug overdose, or suicide.

The 3rd Egyptian Armored Division was completely eliminated and 120 Egyptian prisoners were taken in the battle at Wadi Mab'uk.[14] The Egyptians also lost their Second Army Commander, Saad Mamoun, who suffered a heart attack at the beginning of the day. By contrast, Israeli losses were 50-150 tanks, 60 other armored vehicles and some aircraft.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Mr The Challenge !!!!!, you seems like a nice Egyptian patriot (I really honor it), but still you have to learn some facts:At the end of the war (Day 15th of 17 in totale) Israel forces were on \textbf{African} ground (the west bank of Suez cannel) surrounding the remaining of the whole Egyptian army (3rd and 2ed armies) and aimed to capture Cairo. Then, Russia threatened to intervene (and start a WWIII). As a response, the US secretary of the state (DR. Henry A. Kissinger) achieved the '101th kilometer cease-fire agreement' – which I recommend you to read and see for yourself. At 1978, your great courageous President Auar Al Sadat Changed his strategy to PEACE!This is how you got The Sinai peninsula back, with so much honor and no blood.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Okay, let's discuss this in a civilized manner.Israel did achieve some victory when you guys invaded sinai and managed to repel every single attempt by Egypt to regain our land. However, at the end we did recover every single inch of Sinai, which is considered a victory, because "victory" doesn't only mean who killed the most or who won the attack, it means that the party's goals have been achieved, and in this case, it was regaining Sinai, which we did. You also achieved a minor victory in the peace agreements because most of its terms were in favor of securing your country, which was your goal in the first place, but that also makes you barbaric because you tried (and succeeded) to achieve this with blood. That was the first point.Second point is, Palestine IS an Arabic country whether you like it or not, because it belongs to the Arabs of Canaan who have been living there for more than 4000 years. Jews did actually live there too, but only for a few years, no more than hundreds, and then they got expelled by the Arab natives. By your logic, Rome should invade France today because it belonged to them at some point in history, Egypt should invade Sudan, England should invade half of the planet, because at one point, the English empire did own almost half of the world. It makes no sense. And don't tell me that Jacob or Israel lived there and this makes this land yours by birthright because he's your grandfather, because by this logic i should write my will to my grandchildren telling them that my grandfather was a Turk, and so they need to invade Turkey because it's their land. Also makes no sense.You are right in one point though, that us Arabs are pretty weak compared to your nuclear arsenal (which your country continuously lies about owning one), and your advanced military and weaponry. But you were also wrong because without support from the world's bully, a.k.a. USA, you would be \textbf{nothing}, and that is a fact that most Israelis say themselves, including some of your own ministers, it's not my own saying.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!27}1/365 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.274 \\  \hline

Bruh.... You zionists are getting really boring.. I know another Arab innocent country will be called Israel soon, and you are gonna protect Israel... Really, Palestine is for Palestinians, you should goo live in your ROOT country.. Israel isn't even a country, They took someone's country by British rights', and called it "Israel"....The world didn't want Jewish peeps to live in this earth anymore, or in any other country, so they sent you with an army to Palestine, A small country with a small army living in peace.I know you are gonna continue shit talk but, we are in 2017, GROW UP AND GET SOME FACTS,...\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Dumb & \cellcolor{green!27}Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}2/285 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.702 \\  \hline

Jews didn't take a land owns to somebody else. They took the land of their fore fathers. They took back their homeland, their fore fathers' land, their fatherland.Its Arabs who had taken a land belonged to Jews and were living on it.

Japan also would have been easily conquered but choose to surrender because they know that Russia can easily rampage their way in as compared to America. In addition, Japan was scared to be run by a \textbf{communist} country as it will endanger the emperor life. Hence by theory, Japan can be invaded and they knew it hence they decided to choose the right person to surrender to.In addition, I feel that China, Vietnam, and India should be on the list. I will also like to add on to one of the comments where a lot of people think "China was invaded and defeated" if you read up on the history, China did the same tactic as Russia which is to exchange space for time. China at that time already had an internal conflict where battles with warlords which include \textbf{communist}, royalist and republican were at a high level, but as of now, China is one whole by itself. If China is able to defend itself even during internal conflict, what do you think when they are united as one and with much advance technology?I am saying this base on facts, anyone who wants to troll can feel free to do so...\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Communist & \cellcolor{green!5} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/255 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.176 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Actually Tazy50, sorry to burst your bubble, but the North was run by the mughals, only for some time, by the time the brits arrived, the mughal empire almost declined, and it were the marathas (\textbf{Indian}/Hindu empire) that ended up taking over their territory, also the Rajputana empire in the west, was also pretty strong as well. The Mughals only had major control on the areas in the north, particularly near delhi. So.....India in it's entirety was not always controlled by the mughals, the last great mughal emperor to have most of India was Aurangzeb, and by that sense they only rules most of India for a little over 100 years.  The reason why we hear about the Mughals more than any other India Kingdom was due to their ties with the Turkish were the Sultanate, their tombs, and the palaces they left behind, these were their legacies. Also if you truly learn \textbf{Indian} history, outside of the ones they teach you in non \textbf{Indian} areas, which is mostly falsified, and over glorified history of the Islamic empire, which sets the Christian tone for the Brits, because Abrahamic religions.   Also for the \textbf{ethnic} group, I hope you know that none of us are purely \textbf{ethnic}, even the most isolated parts of Europe have their own \textbf{ethnic} mixtures, but let me tell you one thing, regardless of \textbf{Ethnicity}, Indians are the only ones today that still follow their ancient traditions, and are still in tact with their ancient root.I mean atleast Indians in India aren't in this false idea that all of their ancestors were of a certain religion, color, \textbf{race}, etc. And I truly believe it's the religious philosophies, rather than the nurture that kept Indians "weak," at least the dharmic religions are the only ones that didn't kill/invade for conversions and gain.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnic, Ethnicity, Indian, Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General, Ethnicity - Native-American & \cellcolor{green!5}7/303 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.31 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Alltime 10sJust a few suggestions. First of all, Canada is different from Russia. To invade Canada to the point of capitulation, you only need to take the St. Lawrence Lowlands. Canada also is cold, but it's terrain is still possible to be used by armored vehicles. Canada could be defeated easily, especially if it wasn't on the same side as the US, which is why it usually is. Japan is also quite easy to invade these days. Unlike WWII Japan, modern day Japan no longer has the initiative and motivation to fight to the death. China has a  plan on how to defeat them as long as the US doesn't get involved. Besides, every country in Asia hates Japan, and should there be an opportunity, Japan stands no chance against billions of revenge thirsty people and thousands of nuclear warheads. As for North Korea, you said most nations couldn't stomach the losses, that is, except for China, but I agree with you that the DPRK can't be invaded due to that very reason, as the only country capable of invading North Korea depends on North Korea to keep it safe from a invasion by the US from Korea. Speaking of warheads and nuclear weapons, Russia has more warheads than the US.That brings us to China. To defeat China via invasion would unimaginable. Aside from the obvious reason, which is that we have an army larger than North Korea, and the largest population on Earth, we are geographically protected. Also, if you can't accept the casualties of an invasion or war with North Kora, you won't even consider accepting the casualties that come from a war with China. Therefore, every single reason you mentioned for North Korea applies to China, along with countless more. In other words, you should really put China on the list. Did I mention the fact no \textbf{nation} has every taken control of all of China in modern times? Also, the biggest thing you should fear about invading China is the fact you can't destroy us without destroying the world. Aside from economic damage, you would also need to kill 1.4 billion people, and should we be forced to a last stand, we will not hesitate to use nuclear weapons. The PLA has less warheads than the US, but more than enough to create an explosion that would cause twice the damage caused by the meteor that helped wipe out the dinosaurs. In fact, every single \textbf{nation} with more than 50 nuclear warheads should be on this list for that very reason. Should a country with warheads be invaded, they would no longer have a reason to not use their arsenal, as why wouldn't they take down as many with them if they are doomed to die?Just things to take into account, no offense meant.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nation & \cellcolor{green!27}Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/471 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.425 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small potebry FIFA I hear you brother, it's confusing but let's put it this way. Winning and losing any war is subject to achieving the political goal this war was established upon. If you go to war to gain control of a land and you get it, you're called victorious. If you go to war to free your land and you free it, then you can claim yourself victorious as well. At the end of the day "War" is \textbf{nothing} but a method to satisfy a political agenda. The Egyptian-Israeli War in 1973 was started by Egypt in order to regain control of the Egyptian Sinai, this happened at the end of the war. It took 6 more years to regain full control of Sinai through diplomatic channels but this would've never happened if Israel won that war. I would not say that Egypt exterminated the Israeli army but I would say the Egyptian army was tough and smart enough to force Israel to retreat and let go Sinai.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!27}1/168 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.595 \\  \hline

In 1973 Israel was recognized by many countries in the Middle East, the conflict was about sharing land with Palestinians. 4- The ultimate goal of any war is to bring peace, however you want peace with your own terms and that's what Egypt did. At the end of the war Israel shamefully agreed to withdraw from Sinai and to give Palestinians a piece of the land. Egyptians made peace based on their terms, actually Israel never had any benefits from this war. Israel lost men and land. That's why Egypt has been regarded victorious in this war.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nation & \cellcolor{green!5}Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/171 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.585 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Several things I would say about the list:1. People's Republic of China and India should be in the list, after all these 2 Asian giants both sport amongst the largest armies in the world,  both nations have massive mountainous terrain.  While the British may have fully conquered India once, and China was once conquered by the Mongols, whose annexation of China was actually more Chinese than Mongol with the Mongols adopting into Chinese culture instead.(all besides, these very Mongols lead by Genghis Khan successfully invaded Russia and left Moscow in ruins, well back when it was still called Kievan Rus), 2nd best attempt so far was Japan in WWII who only reached as far as Shanghai area, and could not go through Guangxi area, so outside of Mongolia noone had succeed yet. In addition to this, China is now boasting an army that is going through massive modernization, most Chinese military hardware have already caught up to western standards.2. Nearest Naval invasion of Australia would be China, the Chinese have a fleet at least of at least 5 times larger than the Japanese fleet, along with that is their large marines force. The China today is no longer the backwater army like back in World War II which can hardly afford a rifle for every man in service, it sports not only the largest army, but also one that is well equipped.3. Cuba, if by achievements alone, not many are capable of withstanding the might of the USA, this little guy here did, and what's even more impressive is that its right at USA's doorstep! similar to the Japanese Cuba is an Island \textbf{nation}, whose geography itself lends it much defenses.4. Speaking of the Japanese, aside from the Mongols invading Japan, and the Western Powers bombardments(I suppose this don't count as invasion as the goal was to open Japanese trade, on a very unequal terms, which resulted in Boshin war... which is a civil war.), I have yet heard of Japan being invaded, although I'll give credit as Japanese geography and modern armed forces indeed makes it difficult.5. Japanese Airforce is hardly cutting edge now, in fact many parts of its military is not a cutting edge technology, F-15 while is also being used currently by the USA, the year now is 2017 not 1980, with US flying F-22 and F-35, China having their J-20 and J-31 almost ready, Russia with T-50, Su-35 and Berkut, the F-15 is a jet of the last generation. Type 10 while seemingly a good tank  it merely sported a minor upgrade in Armor, no change in gun and most changes are in its electronics in comparison to the Type 90, which is based on the Leopard 2A4, which is outdated.  Not to mention the majority of Japanese tanks are the outdated Type 74 which are obsolete even by the time it came into being. we're not going through its other equipments such as artillery yet but Japanese ground forces aren't its main thing anyways, the biggest thing it bring are its Kongo destroyers, which are based on the Arleigh Burke, a proven design, but even then said design is also starting to show \textbf{age}. So. . . if I were to make a top 10, I would say:1: USA - on top of being the only super power in the world as of the moment, it sits on a continent away from all other great powers separated by Oceans, and is the \textbf{nation} that sports the strongest navy in the world2. Russia - If the harsh climate isn't enough deterrent, there's the nuclear deterrent, on top of this is that Russia have a very well armed military3. India - India's mountainous terrain on top of bad infrastructure will make moving through India a pain in the ass, currently, India also sports a very large and modern army armed with T-90, Su-30, Brahmos missile and are seemingly acquiring nuclear arms.4. China - militarily, China is probably stronger than India and likely as strong if not stronger than Russia at this point, having pretty much among the largest navy and the largest army, very well armed with a lot of R\&D making sure that China is capable of domestically produce competitive weaponry, on top of this is that China varies greatly in climate all around, you get an arid and freezing North, and pretty much marshlands in the south, what weapons the invader bring must be capable of accommodating all that varied terrain and climate, and chew through the largest, and among the most well armed military in the world.5. United Kingdom - Its an Island \textbf{Nation} with among the best navy in the world, on top of that, despite the declining budget, UK military is still one of the most advanced, hell, its much more powerful than that whatever Japan has, its arsenals are also more up-to-date, It carries nuclear bombs, it is a NATO member, there's a good list of reasons why UK cannot be invaded. 6. Japan - Japan is an Island \textbf{nation}, the seas makes a natural barrier against invaders, Japanese navy is also huge, unless the enemy could land a significant beach head, Japan is safe, and not many nations are capable of such.7. Israel - Among the most armed to the teeth \textbf{nation} in the world, in the middle of a desert, it also catches many support from the Western powers, Israel is very geared to be ready for war at most any time. Israel also pilots in many conventional arms.8. Canada - for all the reasons in the video9. Sweden - what happens when you have basically frozen lands as your home, separated by a sea, is mountainous and your \textbf{nation} have a huge military production capacity, yup, you are hard to invade.10. North Korea - I'm not very keen at putting this \textbf{nation} in the list given that all their weapons are already far aged too much, their nuclear tests often fails, their doctrine seem to be very outdated and the \textbf{nation} is generally, just a backwards \textbf{nation} on steroids, but give credit, IT IS ON STEROIDS! well North Korea do host among the biggest army, the biggest special forces, their mountainous terrain also lends it to be very hard to navigate through, on top of that if you invade from the North, there's a huge river crossing, from the south, well good luck not stepping on a landmine. The landscape is perfect for a partisan style of fighting and there's really little reward for invading North Korea, especially they have the potential to throw nukes\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Nation & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}10/1112 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.899 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small My opinion about me as a American that being invaded would be a \textbf{weird} experience for Americans. Also in some states there are at least some navy bases, army Air Force etc. Another thing I believe the most hardest places to invade would be the east coast, mid-west , and west coast. Plus we ally with A lot of people. Also neighborhoods all around America will go lockdown and wait for military to come to defend us or take children to a safe place were they won't get hurt. Same thing with weapons. Most Americans at least have a weapon they can carry. So if this did happen let's remember America has a good army, special forces and Americans. In general I do believe that attacking America would indeed might cause a big war with who ever invades.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small For anyone saying the US wouldn't be number 1, think about this- There are more civilian owned guns than people in the US. And you are also able to purchase miniguns, LAW rockets, recoilless rifles, etc. Just need certain weapons permit, which costs a lot of money, but is possible. We have the world's most lethal navy. We have 10, soon to be 11 nuclear powered supercarriers, each capable of holding around 85 aircraft. We have the world's most destructive MBT. Sure, the M1 Abrams is completely outclassed by things like Korea's K2 \textbf{Black} Panther and Germany's Leopard 2a7, but slap on a battle package or two and then it can compete. Our tank crews are also excellent. We have the world's most lethal air force. The F-35 program, an aircraft that can detect and lock onto an aircraft 180 miles away, which is also almost impossible to track and even more impossible to lock onto. The F-22 program, basically a better F-35 that can actually hold its own in a dogfight thanks to the world's first computer assisted thrust vectoring system. Nukes, so many nukes, Trident missiles, Ohio-class submarines, etc etc. The US is one of the largest countries geographically. The diversity of our geography also leans to our advantage. We have deserts, swamps, mountains, you name it (no jungles though). The US's economy is also strongest when we're fighting a war. WW2 pulled us out of the Great Depression faster than high schoolers having underage \textbf{sex}. Our economy was very strong during the Operation Desert Storm, Operation Iraqi Freedom, the War on Terror, etc. Our colleges also are capable of breeding some of the most toxic people ever, capable of tearing down entire societies. Canada is also extremely good at this, possibly better than the US. Final reason? James Mattis. He threw a grenade killing 30 people, and then the grenade exploded.

In Chinese history, China was ruled by non-Han Chinese twice, they were the Mongols and the Manchurians. China also nearly-colonised by various European empires. And being pillaged by Japan once, it was just because the Japanese started the Pacific War, opened another front against the USA.

He is the Wikipedia you cry about so much: [LINK] Just to make it easy on you:"The peace treaty between Egypt and Israel was signed 16 months after Egyptian president Anwar Sadat's visit to Israel in 1977 after intense negotiation. The main features of the treaty were mutual recognition, cessation of the state of war that had existed since the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, normalization of relations and the complete withdrawal by Israel of its armed forces and civilians from the Sinai Peninsula which Israel had captured during the Six-Day War in 1967. Egypt agreed to leave the area demilitarized. The agreement also provided for the free passage of Israeli ships through the Suez Canal, and recognition of the Strait of Tiran and the Gulf of Aqaba as international waterways."EDIT: you know what? Fuck it I'm not done...From Britanica:  [LINK] "ix-Day War, also called June War or Third Arab-Israeli War, brief war that took place June 5–10, 1967, and was the third of the Arab-Israeli wars. *Israel's decisive victory included the capture of the Sinai Peninsula, Gaza Strip, West Bank, \textbf{Old} City of Jerusalem, and the Golan Heights*; the status of these territories subsequently became a major point of contention in the Arab-Israeli conflict."From History.com:  [LINK] "Beginning on June 5, Israel focused the main effort of its ground forces against Egypt's Gaza Strip and the Sinai Peninsula. In a lightning attack, the Israelis burst through the Egyptian lines and across the Sinai. The Egyptians fought resolutely but were outflanked by the Israelis and decimated in lethal air attacks. *By June 8, the Egyptian forces were defeated, and Israel held the Gaza Strip and the Sinai to the Suez Canal.*"I wonder what \textbf{mental} gymnastics will you do to make this look like something other than a complete humiliation.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small hi Dan, nice to chat with you again.as for the first part we agree hezbollah didnt surrender.second part:we r talking about strategy and i agree with what you said but this cannot end without mention why israel didnt want to occupy , every politic in israel that lebanon is the end of his career and israel army cant stay in lebanon as previous occupation proved it, hezbollah constatly attacked and raid def fences til they kicked every soldier out including who sold their country and worked with you.third part:i dont know what happened after the war on Gaza but on lebanon as i said in the previous part israel didnt want to take any land cuz simply wont hold it.and as for fourthly :D i didnt know either but i am excused since im not that good in english:Ptheres \textbf{nothing} much for me to say, we r discussing here was israel failed and that was my point that israel failed, im sure ur being honest by saying that u had logistics problems but that wasnt the only reason , israel   lost at AL Hjeir Valley more than 50 tanks as your media stated and we r talking here about merkava , israel didnt just lose some tanks , israel lost a huge image about their tanks and it was the rise of cornet missile.the part next without a number :Das i said before numbers in valley of al Hjeir the number exceed the number u just said, i really have to mention something since that ur addressing me by person and not by only an argue,  i am not happy with every casualties has fallen specialy the civilians and no one here in lebanon is  happy with it on ur side or our side. but israel know how to hit civilians and u watch search israel massacre on lebanon 2006. and to get back to my point the numbers dosnt show who won the war im sure hitler killed more than the allies has killed and allies won the war. its all about objectives.Dan for the last part its terribly terribly wrong , i dont know what u have told about the southern lebanese army. but those killed and tortured civilians stole and raped by the name of israel , those are not army and i dont know how u can call them lebanese army , at this point ur taking me as a stupid , how its a lebanese army and it was protecting you, how an army can work for another country where did u read that definition of a \textbf{nation} army, those army killed me \textbf{old} grandfather (and i mean \textbf{old} by \textbf{age} at that time when he was killed)  threatened my family so it had to escape to beirut im not talking about my self i wasnt born yet at the time when they was in our southern village , but my brothers and sisters and they was young,  now thats one example of me theres so much sad storys there u can find.i would like to end with a personal msg Dan  when Hitler started to kill the jews they were never touched in the arab countrys, we had jews here in lebanon but mostly r gone and live in israel now i guess , they still have a warchip building in beirut, and its never touched or destroyed , i have never learned to hate someone based on his religion and neither anyone else , i dont know what they told u , everyone here live a normal life like u do , we have jobs and we have to go to work and to raise our kids , those ppl dont kill each others just like that,  its all god dam politics.stay in touch, maybe we can discuss during the next war if it happens and i lived after it :Dbye\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Nation, Nothing, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Age - Youngsters, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}5/661 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.756 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small +Mac180s Despite the fact that they have no fifth generation fighter aircraft, bombers, and rely on their domestically produced F-2 which is based off of the F-16. The only advantage they ever had was in the mid 1990s when the J/APG-1 was introduced on it. The J/APG-2 doesn't appear to be as advanced as other AESA radars such as the AN/APG-83 SABR. The F-15Js are still using the mechanically steered AN/APG-63(v)1. Instead of a fully operational 5th generation fighter, they have only made a technology demonstrator, we had prototype stealth fighter aircraft in the 1990s with the YF-22 and YF-23. In addition, they lack strategic bomber aircraft such as the B-2, B-1B, or B-52H, nor do they have access to the stand-off weapons the USAF uses. In conclusion, their weaponry isn't as advanced, their aircraft roles aren't as diverse as the USAF's, and their aircraft aren't as advanced as those used in the USAF.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small most of these make a good deal of sense, but I have no idea how Israel got onto the list. everything depends on foreign willingness to back and defend them. Eventually either a cultural, political, or more likely economic incentive or movement will lead to the west withdrawing its unconditional and massive support for the country. honestly that is what worries me the most. Israel really does need to make peace and play nice with its neighbors already. the crusader kingdom of Jerusalem survived for a little over a century there (alongside Antioch and numerous other Kingdoms people thought would last forever), but just like all the others they were eventually driven out once the surrounding nations united and the foreign support began running dry. they really need to reconsider their position in the Middle East. the region has just now passed one century since the end of Ottoman unity and about 70 years since the end of mandate and colonial authority. as has been seen countless times in the history of the region. it takes a good century or two of chaos, authoritarianism, and economic stagnation before things begin to move once again towards unification, economic boom, and civil/technological advancement. Once that happens Israel will really need to accept itself as a Middle Eastern \textbf{nation} and not a western one. It is already one of, if not the last true European Colonial entity outside of European soil. Its government and the vast vast majority of its population is Ashkenazi or Eastern European Jewry (recent genetic tests have revealed that they are basically 100 of European origin, a link going all the way back to prehistory even native European Neanderthals, making them as pure European if not more so than many European \textbf{ethnic} groups.)  As \textbf{ethnic} and even cultural, heck even religious colonizers (it is where comparisons to pre Mandela South Africa come in, and if we are being honest those comparisons are not entirely unfounded, a group of \textbf{ethnic} Europeans carving out a plot of non European land, settling there, exclusively governing there as a minority, and antagonism with an indigenous majority.) Israel is there now, I don't think it should be removed, but the way things are going, once the cycle of history turns back in favor of native middle eastern, which is surely will after the period of chaos that follows the fall of any centuries long empire ends as has been the case so many times before. it must ingratiate itself with its neighbors and accept that it must become a middle eastern \textbf{nation} and not a western \textbf{nation} in the middle east for it to finally have security. it also needs to find a way to once and for all settle things with their indigenous majority.  Also, Its past victories aren't as clear cut as many think, it fought against vastly inferior armies that were also fighting each other at the same time. but today just like back then every depends on the outside worlds willingness to defend them.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnic, Nation & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}6/504 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.19 \\  \hline

Also, they have security cooperation with israel. Current US administration is willing to co-operate with Saudis and Gulf.3) All the so-called jewish nobel prize winners live in US or else where. None of them will live in israel, its a facist country which puts native Arabs and Ethiopian jews as second class citizens. Also, Nobel prize is mostly a politically motivated award anyways. Looks at the number of murderers and corrupt statesmen it gave prizes to rom Bush Jr to Obama, all crooked. Its more like a richman club reserves awards for certain \textbf{ethnicity} of people.4) Because most of the Muslims and their countries are poor, due to past colonization, corrupt government controlled by US and constant invasions. So no, also israel since 1967 got \$300 billion dollar in direct aides in economic, political and military sphere. No \textbf{nation} gets these sort of aid ever.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@DubTech Tv There is no such thing as a Palestinian people; no such thing as a Palestinian history; and no Palestinian language exists. There has never been any independent, sovereign Palestinian state in all of recorded history – let alone an Arab independent state of Palestine. You will search in vain for Palestinian Arab coinage or Palestinian Arab archaeological artifacts specifically related to any Palestinian Arab king or ancient leader. But what you will find are coins, pottery, ancient scrolls, all providing conclusive, empirical and millennial evidence of Jewish civilization dotting the land known correctly as Israel – not Palestine. The present-day so-called 'Palestinians' are an Arab people sharing an overwhelmingly Muslim Arab culture, \textbf{ethnicity} and language identical to their fellow Arabs in the Middle East and North Africa, with few if any distinctions. In 2100 BC various nomadic tribes we're living in the Sinai peninsula. These were Hitting, Girgashi, Emori, Hivvi, Yevusi, and Kenaani. Out of these seven tribes Kenaani were the first ones to settle in the land we now refer to as Israel. Even in the Bible they are the ones being mentioned the maximum number of times. Out of these seven tribes Girgashi went to the far East, not settling in the questioned land, only to never heard of again. There were also smaller tribes such as Zidon, Arki, Sinni, Arvadi, Zemari, and Hamati. In the Bible and the Torah, they are all mentioned. In 1700 BC, Abraham is sent by God on a mission and inherits the land of Israel on behalf of his great great grandchildren who would inherit the land later. Then comes his son Issac who was forbidden to leave the land,it was too holy a land to be abandoned. Then comes his son Jacob who spent sometime in Israel,moved to Egypt,died there, had his body moved to the Israel. In Egypt after 210 very tough years of slavery the Jews left Egypt and made their way to the Sinai peninsula where they received the Torah at Mount Sinai.A smaller area of former Canaaniteland and land east of the Jordan river was conquered and occupied by their descendants, the Israelites after Moses led the Exodus out of Egypt. The adoption of Christianity by the Roman Empire in the 4th century led to a Greco-Roman Christian majority which lasted until the 7th century when the area was conquered by the Arab Muslim Empires. It gradually became predominantly Muslim until the Crusades between 1096 and 1291, when it was the focal point of conflict between Christianity and Islam. From the 13th century it was mainly Muslim with Arabic as the dominant language and was first part of the Syrian province of the Mamluk Sultanate and then part of the Ottoman Empire until the British conquest in 1917.The truth is that the land has historically always belonged to the Jews. The region has come under the sway of various empires and been home to a variety of ethnicities, but was predominantly Jewish from roughly 1,000 years before the \textbf{Common} Era until the 3rd century of the \textbf{Common} Era.If you leave your house vacant for a few years and in your absence someone else occupies your house, does the house belong to the trespasser?

Then, why this double standard with Israel? Isn't it \textbf{racism} or Anti-Semitism?

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@DubTech Tv You are writing your opinions,not facts. Palestine as a region existed,but Palestine as an independent \textbf{nation} never existed. There is vast difference between the two. When Jews began to immigrate to Palestine in large numbers in 1882, fewer than 250,000 Arabs lived there, and the majority of them had arrived in recent decades. Palestine was never an exclusively Arab country, although Arabic gradually became the language of most the population after the Muslim invasions of the seventh century. No independent Arab or Palestinian state ever existed in Palestine. The first time the name was used was in 70 CE when the Romans committed genocide against the Jews, smashed the Temple and declared the land of Israel would be no more. From then on, the Romans promised, it would be known as Palestine. The name was derived from the Philistines, a Goliathian people conquered by the Jews centuries earlier. It was a way for the Romans to add insult to injury. They also tried to change the name of Jerusalem to Aelia Capitolina, but that had even less staying power. Palestine has never existed – before or since – as an autonomous entity. It was ruled alternately by Rome, by Islamic and Christian crusaders, by the Ottoman Empire and, briefly, by the British after World War I. The British agreed to restore at least part of the land to the Jewish people as their homeland.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Raza Khan  - As defined by Merriam-Webster, Cambridge, and Oxford dictionaries, Britannica, ADL, IHRA, and the U.S. State Department, the working definition of anti-Semitism is 'feeling or showing hostility toward or discrimination against Jews as a cultural, racial, or \textbf{ethnic} group.' As with most words, there are several definitions that are valid, depending upon context, but this is the standard definition today. This isn't the 18th century, and we are conversing in English, a language (like most) that obviously has evolved and changed considerably in the last 250 years. But maybe you'd like to adjust your comment according to your reasoning and translate the entire thing to \textbf{old} English, or an archaic version of a European language of your choice? (We'll wait . . .)Don't presume that I don't know what I'm talking about. I've given university lectures on the history of anti-Semitism. You are the one who needs to get your facts straight. BTW, you are also off on your definition of who is a Jew. That is also up for debate, depending on whom you might ask. However, many people whose ancestors were Jews, religious or not, strongly identify as Jewish, while not being religious at all themselves. I know many Jews who are atheists and agnostics. Within Judaism, the traditional definition of a Jew is anyone who is born of a Jewish mother - period - they need not be religious. Then there are those who convert to Judaism, and that's where most disagreement lies.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnic, Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/249 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.803 \\  \hline

We put ALL government jobs with term limits of 2 year except presidency. You will not be able to get a net worth of millions of dollars like some senators rn. This will fix everything, but sadly they would have to be all republican as democrats are too far left to make major decisions. There reaction is to go against Trump even if they know it's the better decision, such as building the wall. They know it's better because it's been proven. The media has shown that there is peace and quiet where the walls are rn while they were trying to prove that we don't need a wall. These videos worked against them. Walls work, letting people in doesn't. I can't wait to see that great big wall honestly. its going to be a great representation of where the US stands on our policy and how to follow it.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Honour AboveAll First, world peace will never exist. War is a natural human condition and will never end. It will become less frequent and more robotic, but it will always exist. Second, the fact that you're supposedly concerned with world peace while glorifying the most war obsessed civilization to ever exist is kind of ironic. If Germany won, you'd either be a slave or you'd be KIA in eastern Russia, the U.S or Japanese Empire. In order to obtain citizenship in \textbf{Nazi} Germany you had to prove all your relatives back to 1800 were \textbf{ethnic} German or Nordic. In which case you'd be eligible for military conscription and sent to an endless war of attrition in one of the many places Germany had to conquer in order to obtain complete world dominance.  I also don't know why westerners care what happens in Israel, it's not your friends and fellow soldiers getting killed in every war, it shouldn't matter to you whether Jews and Arabs kill each other until the end of time, because until all of Yesha is annexed that's what's going to happen. The land of Israel belongs to the people of Israel and I'd rather have war then see half of Jewish land conceded to Arab colonizers.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnic, Nazi & \cellcolor{green!27} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/209 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.957 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Absolutely incorrect, peace treaty was NOT signed as a result of that war but years later, the war was stopped by American pressure on Israel as it planned to take over Cairo due to it possibly igniting  a direct USSR vs US conflict in the event of USSR joining the fight to allow for Egypt's survival, the first days of the war were 100 dominated by Egypt, that's due to hubris and lack of preparation on the Israeli side, but when the tides turned they turned hard, Egypt lost almost all its gains and then some.Again unlike the \textbf{common} mistake - the war did not end in a peace treaty, that was signed years later after a couple of government shifts on the Israeli side.Egyptians see this war as won even though they lost a lot more than Israel in terms of vehicles, man power and land - mainly because of selective memory, they don't seem to acknowledge that they were on the verge of losing Cairo and that USSR and US's cold war saved them.Israel see this war as terrible victory due to it actually feeling like a war where the other side does in fact inflict damage unlike the 6 days war.To quote the Russians"Sadat woke me up in the middle of the night twice over the phone, "Save me!" He demanded to send Soviet troops, and immediately! No!

The fall of the twin towers, the aftermath and the truth of it all is a good example of mass slavery. Americas master has done a good job at making the people feel free but that is over now. USA is being dismantled and written off to make way for the fresh new slaves and system.

Your troops will get here and fight there way through the U.S., only to have their homes and families obliterated back in their home country.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Karna M...nice joke...lol...dude look at 1947-48 war...Pakistani armed forces almost had \textbf{nothing} to fought with well-equiped and well-trained \textbf{Indian} army and yet still they did kick their butts...In 1965, \textbf{Indian} armed forces attacked Lahore, Sialkot and some other areas (of Pakistan). At first, Pakistan did lost many of its men, tanks and area. If we talk about the ratio, it was 5:1 (i.e. 1 Pakistani solder was facing at least 5 \textbf{Indian} Solders). But as the reinforcements arrived, Pakistani armed forces pushed back \textbf{Indian} army into its own territory (upto 80 km). Well, PAF also did it's part and almost destroyed 115-130 IAF's aircrafts  (as described by the neutral resources) whereas PAF lost only 20-30 aircrafts. PNS went inside \textbf{Indian} territory and destroyed a town known as Dawarka and INS was not able to counter it at all...In 1971, Pakistan lost. If USA's army was there instead of Pakistani army, they also would have done the same. In spite of the fact that Pakistan not lost that war but also lost eastern Pakistan (now known as Bangladesh) too, this should be noted that Western Pakistan was never infiltrated by the Indians. Also, Pakistan was not only facing India in 1971, it was also facing Bangali Rebels, USA and Soviet Union (as both of these powers played their part indirectly by cutting off the arms supply of Pakistan and increased the arms supply of India.). So, if you ask me I'll say Pakistan had to lost that war...And now comes the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Pakistan not only provided refuge to Afghan refugees but also helped Afghanistan win the war against USSR and through a proxy war, Pakistan (along with the help of few other nations) broke the Soviet Union into 8 parts...And who can forget the Kargil war of 1998-99. Pakistan had India by throat in that war. Pakistan captured 24 posts of \textbf{Indian} territory. Talking about the ratio, it was again 4:1 (i.e. 1 Pakistani solder was fighting with 4 \textbf{Indian} Soldiers). India used 26 regiments plus airforce whereas Pakistan used only one regiment and some medium weapons. India launched an attack on all those 24 posts (captured by Pakistani forces.). But they successfully took back only 8 while others were handed over by Pakistan due to immense international pressure. Neural resources claim that about 1800 \textbf{Indian} Soldiers either died or were taken as POWs and IAF lost 2 aircrafts, 1 helicopter and 1 aircraft was damaged by Pakistani AA arsenal whereas Pakistani 300 soldiers died or taken as POWs...Again Pakistan and India came In front of each other in 2001-02. There was war alert. Pakistan's President of that time General Pervez Musharraf challenged the \textbf{Indian} forces to attack but \textbf{Indian} forces were not able to do so because they knew that they will lose 3 times more soldiers as compared to Pakistan....So now what do you guys think...Should Pakistan be on that list or not...\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Indian, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Native-American & \cellcolor{green!27}11/493 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.231 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Zaheem Khan In 1947 Kashmir became an Independent state under a Hindu king but muslim majority. Pakistani tribal raiders attacked Kashmir, and raped womrn their, and looted them. When the raidrs were getting hold the King decided to sign the agreement to join India and it is very clear to everyone. \textbf{Indian} Army launched operation when Pakistanis already reached Kashmir. In matter of few days they were pushed back and whole kashmir had to be captured by India but Nehru did a blunder by reaching out to UN for truce. Instead major powers in UNSC used this opportunity and told \textbf{Indian} army for ceasefire. If this mistake haven't had happened then there would have been no Kashmir problem in the first place.In 1965, Pak had clear support of Allied Nations.. viz. US. They had much better equipments and weapons than \textbf{Indian} counterpart. Believing India's New prime minister Lal Bahadur Shastri was weak just coz his height was verh small your General planned to invade Kasmir through Operation Gibraltar by sending in Soldiers disguised as Kashmiris. Kashmiris themselves reported it to \textbf{Indian} Army and soon the operation turned into a failure. On advice of Bhutto General launched Operation Grand Slam (Grand Flop) to invade Kashmir. India reacted by launching its own offensive on International Border and camped outside Lahore. Your army didn't hqve ammunition for even few days. Realising Defeat is imminent Pakistan ran to UN for ceasefire. India again agreed to ceasefire and signed agreement in Tashkent wherein Lal Bahadur Shahstri was Assassinated. In 1971, East pakistan's Mujhibur rehman had won elections to become PM of whole Pakistan but your Army didn't wanted a Bengali to become PM. They committed genocide in Bengal, raped thousands of women, slaughtered people. India had millions of refugees to cater for. Indira Gandhi decided to not to be just a spectator and prepared military for full war and Helped Local Bengalis revolt. Again Pakistan firat attacked India. PAF did airstrikes at several airbases in India and War was declared. In mere 13 days a new \textbf{Nation} Bangladesh was formed which is History. A record more than 90000 Pakistani soldiers surrendered including Genearal Niazi. Your Navy was annihilated. Karachi burnt for days. Half Air force was annihilated and a third of your Army was finished.In 1984, India captured Saltoro Ridge, which Pak was trying to grasp. Again in 1999, your Army in disguise as Mujhaheeds (Cowards) captured \textbf{Indian} posts which were left vacant during winters coz of an agreement btw India and Pak.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Russia is very much possible to invade, just ask the Mongols and the German Imperial Army during WW1. Russia is a prisoner of geography. The Russian core, the lands around Moscow, have been in danger of invasion many times throughout history and that's because Poland, Ukraine and Belarus are flat plains and your army can march across them quite quickly if there aren't armies to put up a fight and even if there are, it is a matter of time for them to break through. The Russian military has a strategy that no other country can have: fall back, scorched earth policy (leave \textbf{nothing} to the enemy), give up land until the enemy supply lines overstretch and let the winter help you and all these are because Russia is the largest country in the world. But if they fail to overstretch the supply lines of the enemy, it is game over for the Russian core, which would be quite difficult, because NATO's (the most likely adversary) starting point isn't the border between Germany and Poland or mid-Poland, it is the border between the Baltic States and Russia, Eastern Poland  and maybe Eastern Ukraine, which starting points are all closer and let's not forget the technological advances since WW2. The thing is that if the Moscow is in danger of being taken over by an enemy, it is very likely that the Russians would use nukes.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!27}1/235 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.426 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I do not agree with these picks at all. Iran and Russia both could be invaded. and as the video stated Hitler would have invaded had it not been for the cold. had this war been in the Summer during the invasion Russians would have been speaking German. not sure the U.S. would have helped that situation had it not been for German's invading other nations as well.  but truth be told who the fuck in their right mind wants Russia. the land is shite. 90 of its territory is worthless.  Iran? yeah the future will see about Iran. I have a feeling Iran is next after North Korea.  speaking of. yes many lives will be lost in a North Korea invasion however people seem to put NK way to high up on its scopes compared to what it actually is. Japan alone could defeat NK. speaking about being more then they actually are is Russia. the only thing Russia has going for it is their Nukes and Tanks. news flash. I don't think little putty is \textbf{dumb} enough to push a button but ya never know when you have short guy syndrome anything is possible. and for the tanks. tanks are worthless in a fight against say the U.S. but would be effective against small country forces. this day in \textbf{age} large wars are won by the air and sea. which the U.S. would dominate Russia without a doubt. half of Russia's military products are a failure. ships are sinking and so on.  that's my two cents. personally I think every country needs to do away with their military and move to better all of humanity.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Ash 360 Western world is brain-washing their kids. Pakistan was partitioned from India in 1947. The justification given for Pakistan was that Muslims can't live in minority with majority being Hindu. Actually, it was a cunning tactic called Divide and Rule where Britain flourished by dividing Indians. So before leaving India Britain broke it into several parts ao that India can't reclaim itself. Pakistan is specifically made for Muslims while India is a secular \textbf{nation}. After partition millions of people died in Riots and bloodshed. Today India has more muslims than what Pakistan has. And Buddhists are rare. Pakistan's sole goal is 'Ghazwa-e-Hind' meaning Invasion of India. Thats why Pakistan doesnt care abt anything but it juat wants to see India going down. We here in India are frustrated by recent terror attacks wherein our hundreda of soldiers martyred.

So yeah he was mean and selfish. And secondly,British did have a (big)role in the partition of India by using communal sentiments to weaken the National Movement lead by the \textbf{Indian} National Congress (which was wholly secular in its outlook), however the actual idea of Partition was not of British Origin.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small But see here is where u need to take a country's internal politics into account. There are bible-headed lunatics who say the whole country is Israel and it all belongs to the Jews and we'll build wherever we want, Palestinians be damned, let them go to Jordan or Egypt or Syria or any other Arab country . These people, and I can't stress it enough, are the minority. Their main supported party in the parliament "Israel is our home" barely scrapes 10 seats, but it's enough for them to be able to hold the coalition by the balls and make them do whatever they want. Add to that the 10-seat or so bible-headed \textbf{lunatic} religious parties who have similar views on the territory of Israel, and you end up with a fact that it is pretty much impossible to form a coalition (61 minimum seats) without at least one of these parties, and both these parties will torpedo the shit out of any two-state peace solution (maybe you can strong arm the religious parties with financial incentives but the other one will never let a two state peace deal happen). Mind you during Olmert's time as prime minister the Palestinians got the best peace offer they ever got before or since which they refused outright. But those times are long goneAdd to that the fact that Gaza and the west bank are practically two different countries now. Hamas currently refuses even to consider any possibility of settlement with Israel. Any deals Israel makes with the Palestinian authority in the West Bank would suffer heavy resistance, and by that I mean Hamas support cells in the West Bank and Hamas rockets and terror tunnels from Gaza because a peace with the Authority de-legitimizes Hamas and it's leaders, who are spending their time in nice Qatari hotels and spending all the billions of international aid money on a lavish lifestyle and really don't feel like losing it. There would be a civil war in the west bank the moment a deal is even close to being signed. Then you get the Iranians who bankroll Hamas and Hezbollah because destabilizing Israel is a useful chip in negotiations with the US and the west.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Alfie Moon is a clown.First off most of the early wars (WWII and before) America was on the winning side quite clearly. As for your other \textbf{dumb} claims, Vietnam was not a "loss" the war lost support 'at home' and thus politicians used it as a way to get elected, and thus pulled us out. The US was winning to that point. Iraq - Iraqs army was crushed within weeks, easy victory, all remaining fighting has been against religious zealots and in fact even that had grinded to near \textbf{nothing}, til we pulled out. In Afghanistan, the US stomped out their targets, again within a few weeks/months, but again are now just fighting religious zealots. Fighting fanatics is not a conventional war, and the US is still there fighting, so even if you want to take your moronic stance on it, it's at worst a "draw". But hey, we did better than the USSR did.Not once has America had to withdraw due to 'losing', it's always been because public support declined and politicians used it as a running platform. Obama did it, and then pulled out of a Iraq that was under control, which led a power vacuum which spawned ISIS.I know people like you masturbate to the possibility of America being defeated, but sadly (for you) it's just another fantasy you won't see achieved in your life time.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Dumb, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}2/231 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.866 \\  \hline

Some Arab leaders have admitted this. The problem is that in addition to being a totalitarian, supremacist, \textbf{racist}, \textbf{misogynist}, \textbf{homophobic} death cult, Islam teaches hate toward Jews. Muhammed hated Jews because they rejected his new religion. Enraged by this, he and his followers filled the central texts of Islam with messages of hatred and death toward Jews. All the peaceful Mecca verses in the Koran are "abrogated" i.e., cancelled out by the violent Medina verses whenever there is conflict between them. This is something Muslims won't tell you when they insist that Islam is "peaceful."Muhammed was basically a very successful \textbf{terrorist} who invaded, robbed, raped, murdered, and took slaves. Groups like ISIS are simply emulating his actions from the Koran in a fully Islamic manner. People who claim that ISIS and terrorism in general have \textbf{nothing} to do with Islam are either ignorant or deliberately lying. ISIS leader Abu-Bakr al-Bagdadi has a doctorate in Islamic Studies from the University of Baghdad. ISIS' actions are justified on the basis of the Koran by legitimate islamic scholars, and millions of Muslims around the world — including 94 of the male population of Saudi Arabia in a recent survey — believe that ISIS are true Muslims who are practicing true Islam.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small +Daniel1) Israel can't be both Jewish \& democratic, even John Kerry said it. If a majority are not Jewish then it ceases to be a democracy. That is why it's called a "Jewish \& democratic state" in its basic laws. Do you think they'll appease the decision \& go with it? Hell no. That is proof of it's lack of full democratic procedure. Sure, it is a relatively democratic state compared to the majority of nations on earth but i just refuted this notion.2) The "Middle East" is an anglocentric term which was invented by British colonialists during the mid 1800's to define their spheres of influence, so it's not a valid geographic designation. Hell, it's not even a valid term, let alone geographic, it's void from a historic, cultural \& \textbf{ethnic} perspective..it's but a mere political conception.3) The irony is that you along with the majority of Jews are from all over the world. In 1933, 60 of Jews came from various European countries, even the Jewish virtual library cites this, it's a fact. Your last name is Zylberberg so i take it you're European, precisely a German Ashkenazi. If not then it must some other European country. One of the definitions of a Jew is if the mother is Jewish then so are the children. That's funny considering that >80 of Ashkenazi maternal DNA originates from women native to Europe. You're European \& Jews belong in their respective countries, i am not like you nor your oppressors because both of you ironically agree on the same thing, that Jews do not belong in their respective countries...yet only when it suits you do you conveniently use the following hypocrisy to your advantage: "Jews were oppressed \& forced to leave", implying you didn't want them to be forcefully exiled, and rightfully so but it shows your cherry-picking.4) Check your facts before talking, you assumed people can't practice their religions in all Arab countries. You do know Jordan treats it's Christians rather well, and so does Lebanon on a governmental level. There are churches in the UAE where Christians can worship, i know because I've been there. If there's discrimination \& repercussions for practicing any religion then this is specifically a backward problem stemming from Islamist so don't pin it on all Arab countries.5) Stop playing victim \& making fear-mongering blanket statements like "all the Arabs want to see us wiped off the map" <---you're the \textbf{racist} \& real anti-semite. Notice i never said anything \textbf{racist} against Jews.6) Not all Jews were forcefully exiled, some left willingly so you need to take this into account before saying "all Jews were forced to leave".

Jews are Polish, Moldovan, Moroccan, Ethiopian, Russian, German, Spanish, French, Iraqi, Kaifeng, Iranian and so on.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small 1) Basing an argument off of the fact that "John Kerry said it" was your first mistake. Your second mistake was arguing that since a majority of people are Jewish it cannot be democratic. Why should majority religion make any difference as to whether its democratic? There are so many sects of Judaism that always clash with each other, it's not like all Israeli Jews agree. In fact there are constant struggles between them. Not to mention America is around 80 Catholic/Christian, does that make America lose its title as a democracy? 2) Seriously man? Are you going to be that petty? Do you need me to make a list of the countries I'm talking about?3) I won't even go the Biblical route here because that surely won't appease you, but from your incoherent rant I take it you are saying that we had a choice of leaving our European homes? You are seriously belittling the holocaust and the effects it had. Would anyone in their right mind return to a country that either sold them down the river and given them to the Nazis, or were invaded and had their homes and possessions destroyed/seized? Either way there was no way they were going to return back to Europe, the place that ruined their life and killed millions of their people. So that's where Israel comes into a play. A place that was historically a Jewish land before we were kicked out, returned and then kicked out and dispersed for another 2000 years. In fact Jews began coming back to Israel in the late 19th century. Read what Mark Twain wrote about it, it was a desolate wasteland with arab tribes scattered throughout the country. Jews came in, civilized it, grew the land, and turned it into what it is today. And when we gave Palestine Gush Katif, a thriving community that was forced to be displaced a decade ago, the arabs burned it to the ground. Now it's a shithole. My point is the latest buildup of Israel was due to the Jews coming in. Palestine didn't even exist until 1988. They have absolutely no ancestral rights to the land.4) I was generalizing. As a majority, the "Middle Eastern" countries have far less freedom that what we know and love about Western countries like America. And we as Americans who are supportive of democracy should continue to support Israel, the only democracy in that region. 5) I'm not playing victim. The arabs are the one who play victim to the rest of the world in order to gain sympathy, and of course cash. We are the ones being stabbed, bombed, shot, ran over by cars. And when we retaliate we are considered the bad ones because we are more civilized and advanced then them. If mexico starting attacking America, the US would sure as shit blow the fuck out of them. And when I say "arabs" I have \textbf{nothing} wrong with individual people, my problem is with extremists, the ones who run the governments like Hamas, and other terrorists.  6) If you are a Jew in a country that starts to show anti-semitic tendencies you would get the fuck out whether or not you're forced to leave. It happened in Europe in the 1880s- 1930's. Many people saw the warning signs and thankfully left before it's too late. If I walked into an arab country with a kippah on I promise you I will likely not make it out alive. None of your arguments are valid.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small +Daniel1) I am not basing my argument off of Kerry, i am simply adding it as a side. Also you idiot, like i said earlier, it's called a "Jewish \& democratic state", therefore it has to be both in order for the \textbf{nation} to be. If Jews don't become a majority they won't let it happen peacefully. That proves the hypocrisy. Furthermore, you can't compare the US with Israel, Israel is a "Jewish state" while America is not a "Catholic/Christian state".2) Its not petty, it's a simple fact most people are oblivious of. If you were truly patriotic, cared about your region \& were well-read about \& history then you wouldn't acknowledge a term British colonialists invented. My point is you cannot make a statistic about "only democracy in the middle east" if the term "middle east" is invalid.3) I never said anything about the dreadful \& horrific Holocaust, in no way did i belittle it. You're not getting my point, Jews are from their respective countries \& shouldn't have been persecuted! Also, most of Europe today is totally fine so don't act like if you step foot there you'll get harassed as a Jew. Just because Jews were discriminated against, it doesn't justify Israel. Why take it out on Palestinians who were minding their own business? Its your European brethren who killed 6 million of you so direct your hostility elsewhere! Lol, you tell me not to quote Kerry yet you quote Twain? I am sick of Zionist idiots who keep saying "it was a desolate land with \textbf{nothing}"..you say this lie on purpose in order to justify settlement. The land had pre-existing people, why do you blatantly lie about that? I've encountered plenty of Zionists who spew the same garbage.4) You're a European-American who has \textbf{nothing} to do with the land, just because your ancestors lived there 3000 years ago doesn't make it yours. What kind of retarded, backward \& radical mentality is this? Zionists are no different than Islamists, you're both self-entitled little brats.5) Yes you are \textbf{racist}, why didn't you say Hamas instead of all Arabs? If i said anything about Jews my comment will be flagged \& ill be labeled an anti-semite by you lot. Fucking hypocrites..you have the audacity..i've never met a moderate Zionist because it doesn't exist..much like a moderate Islamist.6) Jews have been in their respective countries for most of Jewish history, what gives that now you want to flock in to displace the Palestinians? Yes, my arguments are valid, you're just not acknowledging them because you have a predisposed extremist mentality. Please man, you're not addressing my points, why's it ok for Jews to "Return" to a place most have never been to after 3000 years, but Palestinians can't after 70 years?\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nation, Nothing, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}4/467 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.857 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I think the biggest reason a large scale ww3 would be nearly impossible is because of the global market. It would cause depressions in countries and \textbf{cripple} the global economy which I think everyone but maybe the astronauts care about, and even they care. Like it or not but warfare has changed, and is unlikely to become full scale like ww2. What is more likely is proxy wars, because they have already occurred and are occurring now. And also factions vs countries aka terrorism. Things are always in scale. first you have a fight with a friend, then it might go to war between city states, then the world gets bigger and war between countries, then gets bigger and you have a global war, the next logical large scale fight would be war between species/worlds. So probably a war with Mars or aliens for the next "conventional war". This however does not include unconventional wars, which are sill very possible, but are not so much as country vs country. Rather religion/race/sex/ideology wars basically you just keep moving up to the next larger subset, until finally you reach the empty set. JK because new subsets are always being formed/removed.Edit: TL:DR basically warfare has changed and we now takes place in a larger subset. Countries have become too small and therefore it is unlikely we will have a "conventional war" or all out war between 2 major countries again.Also side note, would love to discuss this topic with others if you like debating about arbitrary/subjective/philosophical things.

[LINK] The Federation of American Scientists (FAS) provides science-based analysis of and solutions to protect against catastrophic threats to national and international security. Specifically, FAS works to reduce the spread and number of nuclear weapons, prevent nuclear and radiological terrorism, promote high standards for nuclear energy's safety and security, illuminate government secrecy practices, as well as prevent the use of biological and chemical weapons.Founded in November 1945, as the Federation of Atomic Scientists, by scientists who built the first atomic bombs during the Manhattan Project, FAS is devoted to the belief that scientists, \textbf{engineers}, and other technically trained people have the ethical obligation to ensure that the technological fruits of their intellect and labor are applied to the benefit of humankind. In early 1946, FAS rebranded as the Federation of American Scientists to broaden its network of supporters to include all caring citizens like you who want to reduce the risks to humanity from global catastrophes.Because of generous supporters like you, FAS returned to its roots in 2013 with a new network model that brings together experts from science, engineering, political science, law, and policy, including many younger to mid-career experts. Through task forces, these experts have been shining spotlights on how to make government more accountable and reduce global catastrophic risks.  FAS has also strengthened its highly regarded and effective Government Secrecy Project and Nuclear Information Project.Supporters at any donation level are welcome.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small First of all , i really smiled when i read the comments in the way of cursing to my personal self , where we are here discussing a historical event my religion doesn't allow me to speak to people in such manner and i respect all people and whatever they say, i thought the West People are more advanced in their attitude and speak in a respectful manner! , anyhow all of what mentioned are just speaking of mind without any historical proof , and when we are discussing a state of a historical city we need to provide proofs and not just speaking what we hear and repeat it without sourcing ... , i want to clear first point about the mentioning of Muslims being invaders and invading countries and etc ,  the only  reason for a Muslim army to be engaged in war is either the other country are going under a big suppression and the people are getting offended and not treated fairly under that country's ruling , and the Muslim country was a powerful ruling back in time so they see a need in helping those in need and being treated unfair fully for example the Crusaders who ruled Jerusalem until 1099 they did so many massacres and killing for those Christians and Jews who lived there in the name of church , and they were living under hell fire they had simply no rights! , Muslims and Caliphate Umar ibn Al Khattab came for their Aid , and after Salah Al Din, as a Muslim we have a rule in our Wars and attitude we need to follow even if our enemy doesn't follow and it is told to us by our Prophet Muhammad and he said the following: O people! I charge you with ten rules; learn them well!Stop, O people, that I may give you ten rules for your guidance in the battlefield. Do not commit treachery or deviate from the right path. You must not mutilate dead bodies. Neither kill a child, nor a \textbf{woman}, nor an aged man. Bring no harm to the trees, nor burn them with fire, especially those which are fruitful. Slay not any of the enemy's flock, save for your food. You are likely to pass by people who have devoted their lives to monastic services; leave them alone.how can people with such ideas and orders do any kind of offense and be an offender , judge by yourself!other thing when Caliphate Umar Ibn Al Khattab came to free the city of Jerusalem from the Crusaders who didnt leave any thing without offense , they killed people , children , men, women in the name of church , after he freed the city he gave them this Treaty which says the following with Reference:"In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. This is the assurance of safety which the servant of God, Umar, the Commander of the Faithful, has given to the people of Jerusalem. He has given them an assurance of safety for themselves  for their property, their churches, their crosses, the sick and healthy of the city and for all the rituals which belong to their religion. Their churches will not be inhabited by Muslims and will not be destroyed. Neither they, nor the land on which they stand, nor their cross, nor their property will be damaged. They will not be forcibly converted. No Jew will live with them in Jerusalem.The people of Jerusalem must pay the taxes like the people of other cities and must expel the Byzantines and the robbers. Those of the people of Jerusalem who want to leave with the Byzantines, take their property and abandon their churches and crosses will be safe until they reach their place of refuge. The villagers may remain in the city if they wish but must pay taxes like the citizens. Those who wish may go with the Byzantines and those who wish may return to their families. \textbf{Nothing} is to be taken from them before their harvest is reaped.If they pay their taxes according to their obligations, then the conditions laid out in this letter are under the covenant of God, are the responsibility of His Prophet, of the caliphs and of the faithful.– Quoted in The Great Arab Conquests, from Tarikh Tabari"The Treaty of Umar allowed the Christians of Jerusalem religious freedom, as is dictated in the \textbf{Quran} and the sayings of Muhammad This was one of the first and most significant guarantees of religious freedom in history. While there is a clause in the treaty regarding the banning of Jews from Jerusalem, its authenticity is debated. One of Umar's guides in Jerusalem was a Jew named Kaab al-Ahbar. Umar further allowed Jews to worship on the Temple Mount and the Wailing Wall, while the Byzantines banned them from such activitiesand muslims are invaders and killers and attack the rights of freedom , Judge by yourself??\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nothing, Quran, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Gender - General, Religious Identity - Muslim & \cellcolor{green!27}3/834 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.36 \\  \hline

Russians are still using Soviet equipment where as America loads billions of dollars into our defense and military. I would even say we put to much in, but that's another debate. Now I don't think Russia and America would ever go to war with each other because of the fear of nuclear warheads. But to say Russia would destroy America is inaccurate. Even if Russia was to fire missels at America and they somehow made it passed our anti missle defense, we have over 300 bases around the world, we have ally contries on top of that, along with our own army with 1 million active troops and another million reserves. Now I disagree we lost in the Vietnam and Iraq war because we shouldn't have even gone to war with them in the first place. America has already been to war with Russia and we won.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I really wonder where do you get your news and facts from. I am a European and I can assure you that no European country likes what USA is doing, except for Russia (because it kind of doing the same thing USA does). So, saying America has 100 allies, that is not true. Like I said, USA has allies, but those allies are considered terrorists countries in our European eyes. However, we Europeans do not like what  Russia and USA do, because USA and Russia try to dis-balance the global peace level. Saying USA has a better economy, that is kind of myth. USA has a lot of debt, USA leads the world in being at debt. I do not see any benefits of having all technology advanced equipment, because like I said, whoever was able to create a hydrogen bomb and to go to space, is definitely able to do what most countries are unable to do. Just like USA has advanced equipment as you just stated, Russia has the same thing and even more since the 1940s. Like I said, I do not like the Russian and the American strategy of invading other countries for their own benefit. But that does not make me \textbf{blind} to speak the truth that Russia surpassed USA in almost everything (such as, having a hydrogen bomb before USA, and having a nuclear bombs before USA, invading the space before USA did, having more oil reserve than USA, have more energy production than USA does, better infrastructure than USA, better education than USA, a better educated population than USA does, having a larger land mass/size than USA,  having more nuclear weapons than  USA does, having a stronger defense system than USA does, having an unbelievable destructive rockets system than USA does and etc.) All these give Russia the lead over USA. Like I said, having a better air force and bigger navy, army population, are not beneficial if you have a stronger defense system. Look at it like this, ((I have something that can completely protect me from your attack and that can destroy you if I attack you, HOWEVER, you have something that cannot completely protect you from my attack, and something that would not help you much if you try to attack me)).

We have a larger population, about 3x actually, a more well armed population, and a more free thinking population. Oil is irrelevant since we now have as much oil as we need with the Dakota pipeline and the Texas/Alaskan reserves along with others such as Ohio.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Britain did survive without it's allies, between 10 July – 31 October 1940 in the Battle of Britain. The question you ask is \textbf{nothing} but a loaded one, because to win a war as vast as ww2 every country needed backup, Germany found that out the hard way. It's one thing to survive for a battle alone, another to survive a war. Britain would not survived without the USSR, because Germany would have directed everything at it. But that doesn't mean the Battle of Britain was won because of allies, there were no allies fighting that battle! The ingenious radar system and cracking of the enigma code (which was sped up through Polish codebreakers) are what won the battle and ultimately saved Britain.The USSR was large enough and had the benefit of the elements to be able to soak up anything Germany threw at them, even if they had the best military on the planet. Although if Germany had no one else but the USSR to worry about they could have taken their time about it (better equipped themselves for the elements) and probably would have won in the end. Britain didn't have those luxuries. So, thanks to the USSR, Britain survived and thanks to Britain d-day was able to launch to retake Europe before the communists did. Obviously there was the battles in north Africa and the push through Italy that also wouldn't have been possible without Britain's efforts in stopping Rommel's advance.The overarching point is thus, without allies \textbf{nobody} would have won, it was allies that halted the mightiest military the world had ever seen. To say that Britain were just an irrelevant bystander in all of this and you could take them out of the equation and still win against Germany is extremely naive.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nobody, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!27}2/299 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.669 \\  \hline
