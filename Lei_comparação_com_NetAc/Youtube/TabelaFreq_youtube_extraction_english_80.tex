  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Very sad! Could it be possible this man married this \textbf{woman} to use as a \textbf{guinea} pig to practice perfecting his surgeries? Then use her to entice people to come to him for plastic surgeries. Lady, you better get to praying to Jesus Christ! It is not His will that your husband keep cutting on you.  Body perfection is not achievable because your husband is spiritually sick. He will always see something not right. Therefore, he will be cutting on you for life or until he finds a more suitable model. He has a problem. Sooner or later this man will be looking at his daughter to cut on and will try to persuade her to go under his knife.  Decisions are going to have to be made because your life is on the line.  YOUR HUSBAND IS NOT THE CREATOR OF HIS BODY NOR YOURS. Creator God gave you that body not your husband. So you need to seek Him about STOPPING this foolishness. This is not love. This is exploitation.  Jesus Christ is Lord.

To be fair guys, they have the money and skills and it is their body. I don't understand why it is such a shame to have cosmetic surgeries. Lots of celebrities have been doing that and only a few people would comment on it. Just like how people had been praising the daughter for her opinion, maybe people should also consider respecting the couple's choice to go under the knife. And as long as they do not force the daughter to have plastic surgery which she hated, I see \textbf{nothing} wrong with it. Nowadays we have been enforcing the message to "be yourself". It might be a simple concept to grasp but it is hard to execute for some people who are insecure with their own natural state, especially with all the beauty standards and the peer pressure. It is easy for us to say. "Well, just ignore them and be yourself". Unless you have been in someone else's shoes and experienced what they have experienced, in my opinion (yes it is an opinion, calm down, lol), I don't think it is fair for us to judge others decision in their life.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I am free in Jesus Christ and live a happy life; I have been free from the bondage of \textbf{sexual} sin for eight years now. I am free heterosexual pornography, \textbf{sexual} immorality, which is fornication, adultery, and acting out, which is a professional term for masterbation. Jesus set me free and I am free indeed. It is exciting to be a Born again Christian, and to be indwelt in my body, and sealed with the Holy Spirit of God. I have a wonderful wife and two daughters, whom I love with a Christlike fervency. Jesus has called me to be a missionary to other countries, and at home in the U.S... I am blessed to say that Jesus loves you and me equally the same. I believe even though he is perfect and we are imperfect he loves us, but we have only this lflife to receive himas Lord and Savior. Finally, if you are projecting your feelings on me about religion then you have no idea what relationship with God is all about through Jesus Christ. It is simply said on my behalf that Jesus loves the sinner and hates the sin, that is why he died for all mankind, but you only have this life to choose to repent of ones wicked lifestyle and turn to Jesus and receive forgiveness for the sin of Adam and Eve and self because all are born in this world with the Adamic nature, meaning fallen nature. Jesus died for your sins and the Bjble says that without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sins, his blokd upon believing and following Him undeservingly saves one from eternal punishment, this is known as the doctrine of Hell in the Bible, eternal torment would. If I hate my own sins when I fall short at times as all Cbristians do then I am not going to be able to stand everyone elses sins neither. Jesus has taught me through his Spirit how to love you and the world and hate sin at the same time. I sincerely believe unequivally that these poor souls are narcissistic, and there own god is themselves. So, even if they say they believe in God that is between them and God, but Jesus did say that there will many who will stand before me and declare that they were Christians and did all these things, theb Jesus will say depart feom me you worker of sin. Actions speak louder than words. There is a scripture in Proverbs that says there is a way that seems right to a man, but the in the END IT LEADS TO DEATH, (Hell). Jesus says that THERE WILL BE SOME WHO WILL NOT TASTE DEATH UNTIL THEY STAND BEFORE ME. ALSO IN ANOTHER PLACE JESUS SAYS THE RICH HAVE ALREADY RECEIVED THERE CONSOLATION. JESUS SAYS FOR A RICH MAN TO ENTER INTO THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS FOR A CAMEL TO ENTER THROUGH THE EYE OF A NEEDLE. By the way, learn how to discourse without speaking like an immature child. However, the reason why you respknd in nastiness and anger is because the Bible makes it clearthat out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. If you speak filth it is because you have a filthy heart. You can disagree with me all you want, but you are not disagreeing with me but the word of God. Repent and believe the true Gospel of Jesus Christ. Without him all are destined for hell except for children who are under the \textbf{age} of innocence and who do not have the \textbf{mental} capacity to know right from wrong. Jesus says in John 3 That unless one is born again he can not inherit the Kingdom of God. John says For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only son that WHOEVER BELIEVES IN HIM SHALL not perish but HAVE ETERNAL LIFE.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small You hit \textbf{nothing}, the only ones that can back you are those who reject the gospel. Your comments are puffed up and full of self, just like these people unfortunately. However,it is the gospel of Jesus Christ that will save you and these people. If you don't like what I am saying take your gripe to God. If you want to spit in my direction then all you are doing is taking out your anger on me because I am telling you the truth. Rather, look straight up spit, and you will notice that all that spit will fall right back in your face. I didn't write the Bible I just believe what it says. You problem is with the Bible. People who abuse the Bible and are on power trips will lead you to follow them. I say Follow the Godman Jesus Christ because it leads to reconciliation with God the Father, the indwelling of the Holy Spirit; the redemption of your soul from Hell; finally having the blinders removed from your eyes. In Corinthians it says that the natural man can not understand the things of God and they are spiritually discerned. That Spiritual discernment of knowing God comes at the price of Christ dying on the Cross, rising from the dead, and the pouring out of the Holy Spirit. That is why the only one who truly knows God are those who have the Holy Spirit indwelling them.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}1/241 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.415 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Nigel Uno¬†How many times can you miss the same point? When you lose your teeth and get implants you are replacing what you lost due to natural causes. When you get something like breast implants it is not replacing something natural nor does it enhance health. If a person loses his teeth, he loses the ability to chew food. That becomes a detriment to health if not fixed quickly. Didn't you watch the video? This plastic surgeon prides his work on aesthetics and he is not at all hiding it. And you are very na√Øve if you think the majority of work done by plastic surgeons are pro bono. Although you may help the war vet look better, you are doing \textbf{nothing} for his general health. And more people commit suicide AFTER plastic surgery. Do your research. My point is most plastic surgeons are far from noble, but it is a lucrative practice so it will exist. My problem with plastic surgery is that it feeds into the idea of instant gratification, no hard work was involved to achieve your new body, you bought it. The rare cases of reconstructing burn victims or war vets hardly outweighs the cases due solely to person who wants to look better without putting in effort. And sometimes you just need to accept the facts, people \textbf{age} and hopefully you are comfortable enough with yourself to accept it because no amount of surgery will change that. By getting teeth implants you may prolong your life because you are able to eat normally but it's hard to make a case to say plastic surgery can prolong life, again there are few if any health benefits.
