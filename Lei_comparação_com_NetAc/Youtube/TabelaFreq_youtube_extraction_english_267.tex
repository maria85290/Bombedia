  \cellcolor{green!27}\small George Let's start at the beginning. In 722 BCE, the Northern Kingdom of Israel fell to the Assyrians and the majority of its population was apparently expelled. These are the "Ten Lost Tribes". This sort of forced migration seems to be part of standard part of Assyrian management of newly conquered territories. In about 586 BCE, the Southern Kingdom of Judah (remember, that Israel had been divided into two distinct kingdoms) was conquered by Babylon, and only the notables led off (the "Babylonian exile"). In neither of these cases do the Hebrew/Jews seems to be particularly singled out.Lets skip to the Roman Era. Here, the Jews are unique. Roman policy granted wide religious freedom--however, there were two exceptions. 1) secret "mystery cults" were widely suspected, 2) groups that refused to sacrifice to the emperor (first Jews, later also Christians) were treated as suspect. The Jews led a series of wars against the Empire called the "Jewish Wars" that ended up with the destruction of the Temple after the First Jewish–Roman War (67-70 CE) and ultimately the majority of the Jewish population of Roman Province of Judea being killed, exiled, or sold into slavery in the aftermath of the Bar Kokhba Revolt (132 – 136 CE). These are exemplary of the unique relationship Jews have within the Roman Empire, but is likely not what you're asking about.Most of what people think of are the Medieval and Early Modern expulsions from states in Christian Europe. One thing to note is that Jews existed in these places at all. No other religion besides Christianity existed in these states at all. Judaism had a special status that, say, Roman Paganism did not, and therefore they (often) were the only religious minority allowed to exist. So, it's important to note, they were the only religious minority that could be expelled from Europe (besides various Christian "heretics"). It's worth noting that the vast majority of expulsions of Jews were done by Christians, with a few isolated (and generally late) cases of expulsion by Muslim rulers.Karen Barkey and Ira Katznelson have an interesting article, whose name I forgot, that argues that the expulsion of the Jews by England in 1290 and France around the same time were the result of "state formation"/"state making". Remember, for most of post-Roman history the centralized state as we imagine didn't exist. It was an overlapping series of domains where rulers claimed varying levels of sovereignty. Katznelson and Barkey argue that the Jews were expelled in England as a compromise between the royalty and the nobility in the process of state formation (primarily, the nobility owned Jewish bankers a tremendous amount of money, as Jews often formed the only source of credit). In France, they argue that they were expelled for a different reason (I believe because the King owed them money, but I can't be sure). But in both cases, though the exact reasons were different, the expulsion of the Jews was part of the same process of state formation, a result of negotiations around the clashing interests of royalty and nobility. This pattern, they argue, is repeated in other states (Western and Northern Europe is generally seen at the vanguard of modern state formation in Europe--see Charles Tilly's epic Coercion, Capital, and European States, AD 990-1992).It's also worth mentioning that Jews were often the only available scapegoats. Many of the expulsions took place during plagues, especially in Germany, where Jews were often accused of poisoning wells. They were also often occurred after an accusation of blood libel. Historically, it's worth noting that blood libel accusation (which date back to at least the 12th century in Christian Europe) never occurred in the Islamic World until the 19th century, and even there, not coincidentally, the first several cases accusation were brought by Christians living under Ottoman Rule at the same there was expanding European influence in the Ottoman. But in general, the relationship with minority communities was different in the Ottoman World (much is made of "dhimmi" status, but there's a reason for that--especially in the Ottoman Empire, the "millet system" in both formal and informal forms was an important strategy for rule). In the Muslim World, Jews and Christians were often included alongside Muslims as (unequal) subjects in a way that they were not in Europe. Granted, even these limited rights were frequently violated, but this legal framework of (unequal) belonging provided the Jews (and minority Christians) with much more stability than they had in most of Europe of the same period. This situation remains essentially until \textbf{nationalism} arrives in the 19th century century.\textbf{Nationalism}, the idea that the legitimacy of the state comes from its relationship with a titular "\textbf{nation}" (France is for the French, Germany for the Germans), generally dates only back to the French Revolution (this is the traditional starting date). There were of course other forms identity underlying the legitimacy of states before this--especially religion, as John Armstrong argues in Nations Before \textbf{Nationalism}, but this wasn't really \textbf{nationalism} in the sense that we see (a political demand for a Christian state for all the Christian, etc.). A few scholars--Philip Gorski, Liah Greenfeld, Anthony Marx--have argued, convincingly I think, that we should see \textbf{nationalism} as an Early Modern phenomenon, rather than entirely a Modern one (remembering that "the Modern Era" for political history is conventionally dated to around the French Revolution). Among these, Marx argues most convincingly that \textbf{nationalism} comes not just from union--gathering all the Rutherians into the Rutherian state--but from exclusion. He engages with three main examples (England, Spain, and France). In Spain, we see this process of expulsion--this Proto-Spanish \textbf{nationalism}--in the form of the expulsion of Muslims and Jews from Spain in 1492 (and from Portugal in 1496). This sets the ground for the later Spanish \textbf{nation} state. Similarly, in France we see expulsions, but not of Jews. Rather, we see France kill and expel Protestants to create a purely Catholic realm (cf. St. Bartholomew's Day massacre in 1572). These sorts of expulsions were \textbf{common} during the European "Wars of Religion". So \textbf{nationalism}, and the drive to create in theory culturally homogenous states, wasn't merely a process that affected the Jews, though it was a process that often affected the Jews. It's also worth noting that "Jewish emancipation"--Jew being able function as equal citizens--doesn't emerge until the French Revolution, and the question of whether Jews can really be members of the \textbf{nation}-state isn't settled until the 19th and 20th centuries (cf. the Dreyfus Affair in France, or the \textbf{Nazi} stripping of the rights of German Jews). Many of the expulsions of Jews (and Catholics and Protestants, etc.) that occur during the early Modern Period, Anthony Marx argues, should be seen as examples of emerging \textbf{nationalism} where cultural identity becomes tied to the polity (compare this to earlier empires which were inherently diverse).So, therefore, recent social science works argues that 1) since Jews were the most \textbf{common} religious minority in Christian Europe, they were the ones most commonly persecuted against, 2) that a lot of the Medieval struggles around \textbf{nationalism} have to do with negotiations of elites around the beginnings of modern state formation/centralization, 3) I forgot to mention also the traditional answer of the late Medieval religious revival, including the Crusades, that ultimately led to the Reformation and the Counter-Reformation, which mattered in some places (especially when tied to Blood Libel), just not the French and English cases I mentioned, 4) eventually the goal of religious homogeneity presaged the overall goal of cultural homogeneity of \textbf{nationalism}. Again, this is all primarily in Europe until the 19th century, though there were large populations of Jews in Anatolia, North Africa, Mesopotamia, Arabia, and Persia who were mostly unmolested. This, I think, is evidence that the repeated expulsion of the Jews is not necessarily something inherent in the Jews, but something (or several things) that characterized the relationship between Jewish minorities and Christian rulers during this period.Edit: One final note. In the video, they often repeat the names of territories in a relatively short period. The reason for this is Jews were expelled, here for either reasons related to Christian religious revival or debts due to state formation, and then were at times often quickly let back in for economic reasons (i.e. the state needed lines of credit that only the Jews could provide in this period), and then quickly expelled either for economic reasons again (rulers had quickly racked up debt) or because of a deal with religious revivalists. But the reasons they were let back in hints at one of the reasons they were expelled.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Common, Nation, Nationalism, Nazi & \cellcolor{green!27} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Nationality - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}15/1435 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.045 \\  \hline

They use the USA as a Tool to execute their Will - in the USA there are about 700 zionist lobby groups and they control the course of the country. And they manipulate the public opinion.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I wonder how many more years we have to spend  to hate or like Jews, their religion and general behavior. This world was a different planet 2000 years ago and even just 55 years ago during World War II. No one's religion is more true than the next one and no one human like figure is or was God. Surely anyone with intelligence has to agree on a more communal definition of God, as  a divine  and very intelligent source to be able to lead the planet's creatures through evolution over millions of years.The amount of people killed in religious wars over the true  and only God and *HIS commandments* is astounding and simply does not affect the 21st century any longer. I believe that because of the CLAN like  brotherhood of the Jews, their desire to be educated and hold high offices with good pay to be able to rise positively and quickly to power after being dispelled from so many  cultures in the past, may be just jealousy. They figured out that family groups  and learned skills were necessary to establish themselves to their liking in a new country.To have 8 jewish lawyers, 5 \textbf{doctors} and a few bank owners in your family is definitely more advantageous in our capitalistic society, than a farmer and electrician, not to demean this valuable trait.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small As the world turns there's a reason why so much energy has to go into worrying about why this is even a thing. There's very cool, lovable Jews among us and that's why it's not Jew, or Christian or Muslim person that deserves hate it is the levers of control that are exploiting true believers, like mom used to say hate the sin not the person bc sinning had to be taught and it's not the poor persons fault. Religions have been trying to control people since we speared woolly mammoths in one form or another and became magnitudes more powerful due to the invention of writing, scribes and priestly class mingled together into royalty and the law became what they said going so far as to deify themselves ,sound like lil bit like anyone yet? By controlling the flow of information and veiling much of it under instuttutions who hid meaning within mysterious deceptions astrology, numerology, riddles etc kept this cabal able to exert vast influence with relatively few members in essence having others do their bidding enthusiastically. Like mom said many times -theres \textbf{nothing} new under the sun. Whether these religions are at their shenanigans under the sun or hidden in shadows it's interesting to see who is active exerting influence to what ends these days and to discern to what ends. You cannot convince me that any man will write something only for the glory of God's spirit inside of us without giving way to temptation to glorify himself with ultimate hubris, oh wait, it's been done who's God's so called chosen according to the person writing it, is it the week, the pious the righteous? This tipped me off although to be fair every tribe and extended family , \textbf{nation} and loose organization of similiar ppl considered themselves better than everyone else, it's practically the name of every tribe ,they say that We are the people, not you or anyone else. That's all good except that we are living in a exceedingly small world where knowledge is leveliing the mountains of ignorance so that the human family that lost iit's roots are meeting each other again and becoming aquainted and do not like being lied to, toyed with scammed, cheated or kept out of the loop in any way the men of one country feel as worthy as any other and especially when people start claiming to be part of a sacred bloodline that considers others inferior or different in some way it is either wrong and must be denied any place in modern discourse or if it's going to be used to prove a point then will be taken as what it is , a bigotted position that invites fierce competition to prove it and that's dangerous as we have seen. Religions are due for a cleanup, Christianity has tried and succeeded sometimes and missed the mark at other times , Islam and Judaism need more than ever to answer this call and especially Judaism in many ways is long overdue for a deep cleaning if it's to lead minds into the future, theres a problem when the very books that  Faith's claim to receive moral authority are smeared with lies and unable to admit where wrong and change. I mean religion has a amazing way of bringing ppl together , it needs to find out where it's going after that like maybe some worthwhile goals that help the guman condition soul equality and rights for all men, but  if it's going to keep out the other 99 of the human beings on the planetthen maybe it's prejudice, \textbf{racist} evil or just worthless and should go the way of Gobekli Tepe and bury itself in dirt.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nation, Nothing, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/621 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.483 \\  \hline

Some other ideas are commented here such as "If everyone hates Jews ,something is wrong with them" or "if they are hated by all their neighbors it means something" - that at least is typically an Anti-Semitic sentence usually commented by people who do not even know they are Anti-Semites.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small RatherA   System is the problem 🏡 Our Life should be around these Great Qualities.....1, Show all living creatures; all the love and kindness as much as you can.2, Only try to be honest with yourself. If you try to be honest with others, you will get into big trouble soon or later.3, Aim only one target at a time; otherwise you are chasing two rabbits and you will miss both. So, the reason behind it. Have one powerful reason and never ever give up the one you want the most.4, Don't try to be good person only but be the powerful person. We will grow to be the one or we will die. There is no other choice. 5, Always learn and look for to improve something your life. 6, You are not alone. Love and faith the high power reduces unnecessary stress in life. But never completely rely on it. 7,  Success and happiness are the byproducts of our usefulness. So, always increase the possibility of success.8, Life is not going to be easy. Because of our unnecessary things. Eliminate all the unnecessary things as much as you can by organising yourself well with the environments. 9, Never believe anything without the proper evidences. 10, Always try to give more than you take. Because it is dignity character of the divinity within you.🌎 As long as people continue to see themselves as separate from everything else, they lend themselves to being completely enslaved. Success depends on how well we relate to everything around us. Joy comes from that bliss of connectedness. I believe that unarmed truth and love will have the final word in reality. To love; you should have good heart. I am a good person until I see a person better than my standard of goodness. Being good is the progress towards a worthy cause. Love is God. Whoever lives in love, lives forever. How selfish it is to try to keep something forever? Love is all about nourishing, nurturing, sharing and expanding the love within you for all. The principle to which we adhere to is that we have kindness of love at heart for the whole of mankind.  As long as there is the unnecessary differences within us; we can not live peacefully so we have to eliminate all the unnecessary differences among us so we can love all. People abilities may vary but not there true love. If we love a person God for a reason then we love the reason but not the person. No reason is the reason to love the person because true love never fails. So do not compare or measure the true love as first or the last but love all truly. If you love people truly then you can understand people. If you don't love then you don't understand people at all.People are controlled by system why?The Cyclical Consumption is the current economy all over the World. It is making the scarcity problems of the earth finite resources to deteriorate day by day. Current Monetary System is legalised theft. Real money is Gold and Silver. Scarcity gives the money more value. Real money won't lose it's value. When Governments stay away from Gold \& Silver then very easy to transfer the wealth  resources to upper class the Rich (Corporatocracy) Elite. When the Governments are printing out more new fiat currency with reserve banks, our \textbf{old} currency is losing its purchasing power everyday. They are printing millions of currency everyday. All governments and laws are existing right now to transfer wealth to upper class the rich elite. The USA Government \& other Governments are in many countries, bailed the investment banks \& financial institutions in 2008 against the majority of the people. There is no democracy in any countries. Because of the Money System based on profits motive only above all else even humans lives and well-being. So, we do not have freedom to protect our values with the money so on. The violence, bankruptcy \& all the negativities are build into the Monetary System of our society. All are owned (including ourselves) by Reserve Bank. Which is private cartel the corporation. So, in legal system, we are legally considered as chattel the properties. They make money in the capital markets with our birth certificates. They do not consider us as Humans. That's the truth. We are at the invisible war with the Elites (Corporatocracies). We have to fight for our Freedom. Resource Based Economy is the Solution. We have to declare the earth resources as the heritage of all the people of this world. So everyone has access to it.

Almost 300 billions dollars just in North America. That is really big business. What would happen if everyone were well? There is no money in health. You see, good health makes a lot of sense but it doesn't make a lot of dollars. Because everything they do is toxic. Every drug they use, prescription drugs, all drugs are liver toxic, bar none. If you've had amalgam fillings put in your mouth by dentists. It is highly toxic. There's cancer because most of the chemos are themselves carcinogens. To view the tumor as the cancer and we know the tumor is not the cancer. The cancer industry is 200 billions dollars a year. The more work they get, the more profit there is. You have to dismantle; If the truth ever came out about what we would need to do. 30 of people of females in America are at risk of getting, will get cancer of the breast.

That they never had the answer orthomolecular. And as more and more of our population start taking their health into their own hands, there's going to be even more and more of changes. It can't go on the way it is. The system is failing apart. We must make nutrition the primary prevention strategy for the population. You are what you eat. You are everything that you have ever done to yourself. The choices you make directly affect the outcome of your life. - (Food Matters Documentary in Netflix)😊 Well, I truly love God. I am not religious but very spiritual person. So, I believe 1) Religion is the beliefs in someone experiences But spirituality is having my own experiences. The mainstream religions people promote religious ideology by giving guidelines and guide but In my spiritual life; I do not want anyone or anything between God and me to restrict my freedom to worship God. 2) We do not need any authorities to do good work. The god work is the good work always. In contrast; organised mainstream religions are claiming that they have the authorities to do God works as leaders so on. 3) God is not capable of doing wrong thing, change the past for us and create anything out of \textbf{nothing} for us. \textbf{Nothing} means not anything. So, even God is limited. The mainstream religious people believe that God is unlimited. 4) God wants us to take responsibilities for our righteousness life but not for all the consequences of our actions because they are continued to exist among us. So, How can god punish us for all our consequences? The mainstream religious people believe we are full of sins because of all our actions. 5) Freewill  is an illusion. People always choose the perceived path of greatest pleasure.  So, we do not have choices all the time. In contrast teachings of the mainstream religions are promoting people to do god's will always because we all have choices of freewill always. 6) We can not separate everything into groups. So, everything for good and evil and there's no success and failure for everything. If everything is real then real things can not be threatened. Once you come to understand that God/The Holy Spirit is in each of us, You will no longer need a Book to tell you how to live. Then why we need religious scriptures? The Virtue is the expression of the basic goodness in our actions. The Basic goodness is the fundamental worthiness of every individuals. We are worthy to God always in everything. 7) Beliefs in a cruel God makes a cruel man. No matter what; every living creatures has the right to live and What makes their life cheap? Everything depends on everything. \textbf{Nothing} too big or too small in value. We can not love and hate at the same time; Being a vegetarian means love without cruelty happily. The mainstream religious people are killing people and sacrificing animals in the name of God. They promote God's cruel punishments. The Punishment is endless for Sinners/Devil according to religious scriptures. But God is love always. Overcome hate with love. If all religions for peace, unity? No way. Because they are not for peace. 8) Well, The God gave us everything to go from moment to moment in our lives as we do our part  and pray only to thank god then the Love is in progress. The Love is always for everyone. We are always worthy of the God's love. Our greatest fear is; not to be loved by anyone but we are all loved by someone. When we eliminate all our unnecessary differences among us then true peaceful life is possible with the true love. If we can't find the peace within ourselves then we will never find it anywhere else. 9) This is the Fight for independence and freedom of humanity to worship God freely without religious guide and guidelines to restrict us. Unnecessarily, We do not want third party controls over us in anything ; especially in spirituality. 10) Revive Survive Thrive. Sincerely,  The Real Peacemaker against religious oppression.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Anti-Semites follows a particular pattern – in the main they are of low intelligence and are fascinated by conspiracy theories, which (if suited to their purpose) they adopt. The bearing of false witness is their predominant trait; passed down to them throughout the ages. As their antecedents were willing to bear false witness - so they have adopted the practice. This flouting of the Ninth Commandment is what their existence is based upon.Their hatred of the Jews is based on jealousy, the jealousy of success through hard work and ingenuity and a creed of helping each other, an eagerness to learn and to pass on that learning. The most famous Jew was Jesus Christ; who according to history was born with these traits. The Irony of the Ante-Semites is that many of them would not exist today without the contribution that Jews have made to Medicine. If they themselves had not been saved by one of these medical breakthroughs; you can be sure that their antecedents would have been. Of course had their antecedents perished they would not exist.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I am called "anti-Semitic." I only have a problem with Jewish Supremacists, Semitic or not, who hate me because I'm not one of them. If you're not a Jewish Supremacist, and don't auto-hate based on skin color, I don't have a problem with you. I try to do unto others as I would have them do unto me. If I'm wrong, let me know. I do the same for you. Before being labeled "anti-Semitic," I was a total Jew sympathizer. It was "Jews" who changed my attitude toward them. Beginning with the \textbf{woman} down the street in the late 80's who wanted to pay me \$1.00/hr when the rest of the neighbors were paying \$2.00/hr. for me to babysit. I was taken aback but nonetheless still a sympathizer. You know... "the holocaust and all."It was the rabbi who taught the university course on Antisemitism in the early 2000's who rocked my world most directly and dramatically. Was I the only non-jew in the class? It was such a traumatic experience for me that I cannot remember how I even got out of it. I know I didn't complete the course. Perhaps I barely escaped their trauma-based mind control in time with a withdrawal.I have a bachelors and a masters so I must have left the class somewhat peacefully. Can you imagine 16 weeks of hearing about how wonderful the Jews are and how evil and murderous everyone else is? When you're a "white" person, already well indoctrinated into the whole white-guilt perspective through public schooling; eventually the camel's back breaks and all is lost. A person can only handle so much false "guilt."The evil of these Satanists is unhinging. So, no, I'm not anti-Semitic. I AM TOTALLY Anti-Satanic though.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small ​\@Joe Soap There are anomalies and paradoxes and obscure passages in every religion... For example why do Christians insist that Jesus is God when the Jewish scriptures tell us  'God is Not a man Nor the Son of Man' Numbers 23:19, or  Why did Jesus call the Caananite \textbf{woman} and her people dogs Matthew 16:26....  Lastly and Most importantly  don't confuse local factional religious interpretations, customs, and  practices,  and traditions (which are non-binding by  Jewish law) with what is considered Halakhah (Jewish law) which is binding. I will go the extra mile for you and explain in a little more detail in what that last sentence means. Circumcision on a  male child on the 8th day is Halachically binding it is Jewish law called Halakhah but thanking God for not making you a \textbf{woman}, gentile, or anything else for that matter is not, its actually called 'aggada' (non-binding) an optional local and sometimes sectarian tradition or interpretation  and in reality  most of the time shunned in  prayer in most synagogue liturgy within the broad spectrum of Judaism.   I hope that answers your questions and if I could offer you one last piece of practical advice  that might help you along this journey that we call life its not wise to paint with large strokes, lines get blurred and many of the important distinguishing details get lost in the process."In line with the accepted tendency to define aggadah as "that which is not halakhah," one could say that the relation between aggadah and halakhah is similar to the relation between theory and practice, between idea and application, and, in the area of ethics, between character and behavior."

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small C Kake   System is the problem 🏡 Our Life should be around these Great Qualities.....1, Show all living creatures; all the love and kindness as much as you can.2, Only try to be honest with yourself. If you try to be honest with others, you will get into big trouble soon or later.3, Aim only one target at a time; otherwise you are chasing two rabbits and you will miss both. So, the reason behind it. Have one powerful reason and never ever give up the one you want the most.4, Don't try to be good person only but be the powerful person. We will grow to be the one or we will die. There is no other choice. 5, Always learn and look for to improve something your life. 6, You are not alone. Love and faith the high power reduces unnecessary stress in life. But never completely rely on it. 7,  Success and happiness are the byproducts of our usefulness. So, always increase the possibility of success.8, Life is not going to be easy. Because of our unnecessary things. Eliminate all the unnecessary things as much as you can by organising yourself well with the environments. 9, Never believe anything without the proper evidences. 10, Always try to give more than you take. Because it is dignity character of the divinity within you.🌎 As long as people continue to see themselves as separate from everything else, they lend themselves to being completely enslaved. Success depends on how well we relate to everything around us. Joy comes from that bliss of connectedness. I believe that unarmed truth and love will have the final word in reality. To love; you should have good heart. I am a good person until I see a person better than my standard of goodness. Being good is the progress towards a worthy cause. Love is God. Whoever lives in love, lives forever. How selfish it is to try to keep something forever? Love is all about nourishing, nurturing, sharing and expanding the love within you for all. The principle to which we adhere to is that we have kindness of love at heart for the whole of mankind.  As long as there is the unnecessary differences within us; we can not live peacefully so we have to eliminate all the unnecessary differences among us so we can love all. People abilities may vary but not there true love. If we love a person God for a reason then we love the reason but not the person. No reason is the reason to love the person because true love never fails. So do not compare or measure the true love as first or the last but love all truly. If you love people truly then you can understand people. If you don't love then you don't understand people at all.People are controlled by system why?The Cyclical Consumption is the current economy all over the World. It is making the scarcity problems of the earth finite resources to deteriorate day by day. Current Monetary System is legalised theft. Real money is Gold and Silver. Scarcity gives the money more value. Real money won't lose it's value. When Governments stay away from Gold \& Silver then very easy to transfer the wealth  resources to upper class the Rich (Corporatocracy) Elite. When the Governments are printing out more new fiat currency with reserve banks, our \textbf{old} currency is losing its purchasing power everyday. They are printing millions of currency everyday. All governments and laws are existing right now to transfer wealth to upper class the rich elite. The USA Government \& other Governments are in many countries, bailed the investment banks \& financial institutions in 2008 against the majority of the people. There is no democracy in any countries. Because of the Money System based on profits motive only above all else even humans lives and well-being. So, we do not have freedom to protect our values with the money so on. The violence, bankruptcy \& all the negativities are build into the Monetary System of our society. All are owned (including ourselves) by Reserve Bank. Which is private cartel the corporation. So, in legal system, we are legally considered as chattel the properties. They make money in the capital markets with our birth certificates. They do not consider us as Humans. That's the truth. We are at the invisible war with the Elites (Corporatocracies). We have to fight for our Freedom. Resource Based Economy is the Solution. We have to declare the earth resources as the heritage of all the people of this world. So everyone has access to it. Please have your research about zeitgeist movement then you know the truth more.  Truth About Health/Drugs Industry Because Of It Your Life At High Risk The drug industry is a 1/2 trillion dollars a year worldwide conglomerate. Almost 300 billions dollars just in North America. That is really big business. What would happen if everyone were well? There is no money in health. You see, good health makes a lot of sense but it doesn't make a lot of dollars. Because everything they do is toxic. Every drug they use, prescription drugs, all drugs are liver toxic, bar none. If you've had amalgam fillings put in your mouth by dentists. It is highly toxic. There's cancer because most of the chemos are themselves carcinogens. To view the tumor as the cancer and we know the tumor is not the cancer. The cancer industry is 200 billions dollars a year. The more work they get, the more profit there is. You have to dismantle; If the truth ever came out about what we would need to do. 30 of people of females in America are at risk of getting, will get cancer of the breast. The ones that are already dead have been grossly mistreated by the medical profession and by the government that supposedly is supposed to encourage free research and development of all possibilities. Why would medical \textbf{doctors} who studied medicine and practice medicine and are heavily funded by pharmaceutical companies why would they go and look into vitamins? That they never had the answer orthomolecular. And as more and more of our population start taking their health into their own hands, there's going to be even more and more of changes. It can't go on the way it is. The system is failing apart. We must make nutrition the primary prevention strategy for the population. You are what you eat. You are everything that you have ever done to yourself. The choices you make directly affect the outcome of your life. - (Food Matters Documentary in Netflix)😊 Well, I truly love God. I am not religious but very spiritual person. So, I believe 1) Religion is the beliefs in someone experiences But spirituality is having my own experiences. The mainstream religions people promote religious ideology by giving guidelines and guide but In my spiritual life; I do not want anyone or anything between God and me to restrict my freedom to worship God. 2) We do not need any authorities to do good work. The god work is the good work always. In contrast; organised mainstream religions are claiming that they have the authorities to do God works as leaders so on. 3) God is not capable of doing wrong thing, change the past for us and create anything out of \textbf{nothing} for us. \textbf{Nothing} means not anything. So, even God is limited. The mainstream religious people believe that God is unlimited. 4) God wants us to take responsibilities for our righteousness life but not for all the consequences of our actions because they are continued to exist among us. So, How can god punish us for all our consequences? The mainstream religious people believe we are full of sins because of all our actions. 5) Freewill  is an illusion. People always choose the perceived path of greatest pleasure.  So, we do not have choices all the time. In contrast teachings of the mainstream religions are promoting people to do god's will always because we all have choices of freewill always. 6) We can not separate everything into groups. So, everything for good and evil and there's no success and failure for everything. If everything is real then real things can not be threatened. Once you come to understand that God/The Holy Spirit is in each of us, You will no longer need a Book to tell you how to live. Then why we need religious scriptures? The Virtue is the expression of the basic goodness in our actions. The Basic goodness is the fundamental worthiness of every individuals. We are worthy to God always in everything. 7) Beliefs in a cruel God makes a cruel man. No matter what; every living creatures has the right to live and What makes their life cheap? Everything depends on everything. \textbf{Nothing} too big or too small in value. We can not love and hate at the same time; Being a vegetarian means love without cruelty happily. The mainstream religious people are killing people and sacrificing animals in the name of God. They promote God's cruel punishments. The Punishment is endless for Sinners/Devil according to religious scriptures. But God is love always. Overcome hate with love. If all religions for peace, unity? No way. Because they are not for peace. 8) Well, The God gave us everything to go from moment to moment in our lives as we do our part  and pray only to thank god then the Love is in progress. The Love is always for everyone. We are always worthy of the God's love. Our greatest fear is; not to be loved by anyone but we are all loved by someone. When we eliminate all our unnecessary differences among us then true peaceful life is possible with the true love. If we can't find the peace within ourselves then we will never find it anywhere else. 9) This is the Fight for independence and freedom of humanity to worship God freely without religious guide and guidelines to restrict us. Unnecessarily, We do not want third party controls over us in anything ; especially in spirituality. 10) Revive Survive Thrive. Sincerely,  The Real Peacemaker against religious oppression.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Michael Epstein Statistics and other facts can be distorted and misrepresented. You have to make sure that you're getting your information from places that aren't trying to tell a story.For instance, are the facts you have merely numbers? Historically written with primary source certification? Do they have an unbiased approach, with \textbf{nothing} to tell other than numbers or history or the like?Or are your facts written next to a headline? A subtitle? Some text that clearly indicates the end goal? Are the headlines often specifically against a certain group, regardless of if the author or speaker themselves is in said group?So, the first two sources I've seen are two youtube videos (with varying reliability considering one of the videos has likes and comments \textbf{disabled}, which silences dissenting opinions, and that same video has a \textbf{woman} who acts like a spokesperson for her entire community )The second video over emphasizes mere aesthetic differences (as if a majority of jews are 100 pure blood or something), and still cites no evidence in the description or comments.The alternet article is a whole other story. I understand very little of overseas politics so I'll leave that be for the moment and analyze the websites as valuable information sources. The website definitely has a story to sell, and a LOT of "he said - she said" going on, with a few sources scattered between. I'd be ok with it as a source, but approach with caution of the news site's need to tell a tale conflicting with it's necessity to tell facts as well.Simce youtube videos are considered valid in this discussion:  [LINK] The video explains that while main reasons were originally for stopping the spread of communism a la \textbf{R\textbf{ed}} Scare style, Isreal is now creating a metaphorical wall and quarantining the Middle East thanks to Muslim extremism like ISIS.But, it still stands that lobbying is very much an issue, and one of the main reasons I dislike capitalism as it's being applied today.Even so, Isrealites should not be treated like garbage because of their views, much like how Palestinians shouldn't be treated like garbage because of their views.Disagreements should only go so far.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small S. Sarajlić   System is the problem 🏡 Our Life should be around these Great Qualities.....1, Show all living creatures; all the love and kindness as much as you can.2, Only try to be honest with yourself. If you try to be honest with others, you will get into big trouble soon or later.3, Aim only one target at a time; otherwise you are chasing two rabbits and you will miss both. So, the reason behind it. Have one powerful reason and never ever give up the one you want the most.4, Don't try to be good person only but be the powerful person. We will grow to be the one or we will die. There is no other choice. 5, Always learn and look for to improve something your life. 6, You are not alone. Love and faith the high power reduces unnecessary stress in life. But never completely rely on it. 7,  Success and happiness are the byproducts of our usefulness. So, always increase the possibility of success.8, Life is not going to be easy. Because of our unnecessary things. Eliminate all the unnecessary things as much as you can by organising yourself well with the environments. 9, Never believe anything without the proper evidences. 10, Always try to give more than you take. Because it is dignity character of the divinity within you.🌎 As long as people continue to see themselves as separate from everything else, they lend themselves to being completely enslaved. Success depends on how well we relate to everything around us. Joy comes from that bliss of connectedness. I believe that unarmed truth and love will have the final word in reality. To love; you should have good heart. I am a good person until I see a person better than my standard of goodness. Being good is the progress towards a worthy cause. Love is God. Whoever lives in love, lives forever. How selfish it is to try to keep something forever? Love is all about nourishing, nurturing, sharing and expanding the love within you for all. The principle to which we adhere to is that we have kindness of love at heart for the whole of mankind.  As long as there is the unnecessary differences within us; we can not live peacefully so we have to eliminate all the unnecessary differences among us so we can love all. People abilities may vary but not there true love. If we love a person God for a reason then we love the reason but not the person. No reason is the reason to love the person because true love never fails. So do not compare or measure the true love as first or the last but love all truly. If you love people truly then you can understand people. If you don't love then you don't understand people at all.People are controlled by system why?The Cyclical Consumption is the current economy all over the World. It is making the scarcity problems of the earth finite resources to deteriorate day by day. Current Monetary System is legalised theft. Real money is Gold and Silver. Scarcity gives the money more value. Real money won't lose it's value. When Governments stay away from Gold \& Silver then very easy to transfer the wealth  resources to upper class the Rich (Corporatocracy) Elite. When the Governments are printing out more new fiat currency with reserve banks, our \textbf{old} currency is losing its purchasing power everyday. They are printing millions of currency everyday. All governments and laws are existing right now to transfer wealth to upper class the rich elite. The USA Government \& other Governments are in many countries, bailed the investment banks \& financial institutions in 2008 against the majority of the people. There is no democracy in any countries. Because of the Money System based on profits motive only above all else even humans lives and well-being. So, we do not have freedom to protect our values with the money so on. The violence, bankruptcy \& all the negativities are build into the Monetary System of our society. All are owned (including ourselves) by Reserve Bank. Which is private cartel the corporation. So, in legal system, we are legally considered as chattel the properties. They make money in the capital markets with our birth certificates. They do not consider us as Humans. That's the truth. We are at the invisible war with the Elites (Corporatocracies). We have to fight for our Freedom. Resource Based Economy is the Solution. We have to declare the earth resources as the heritage of all the people of this world. So everyone has access to it. Please have your research about zeitgeist movement then you know the truth more.  Truth About Health/Drugs Industry Because Of It Your Life At High Risk The drug industry is a 1/2 trillion dollars a year worldwide conglomerate. Almost 300 billions dollars just in North America. That is really big business. What would happen if everyone were well? There is no money in health. You see, good health makes a lot of sense but it doesn't make a lot of dollars. Because everything they do is toxic. Every drug they use, prescription drugs, all drugs are liver toxic, bar none. If you've had amalgam fillings put in your mouth by dentists. It is highly toxic. There's cancer because most of the chemos are themselves carcinogens. To view the tumor as the cancer and we know the tumor is not the cancer. The cancer industry is 200 billions dollars a year. The more work they get, the more profit there is. You have to dismantle; If the truth ever came out about what we would need to do. 30 of people of females in America are at risk of getting, will get cancer of the breast. The ones that are already dead have been grossly mistreated by the medical profession and by the government that supposedly is supposed to encourage free research and development of all possibilities.

That they never had the answer orthomolecular. And as more and more of our population start taking their health into their own hands, there's going to be even more and more of changes. It can't go on the way it is. The system is failing apart. We must make nutrition the primary prevention strategy for the population. You are what you eat. You are everything that you have ever done to yourself. The choices you make directly affect the outcome of your life. - (Food Matters Documentary in Netflix)😊 Well, I truly love God. I am not religious but very spiritual person. So, I believe 1) Religion is the beliefs in someone experiences But spirituality is having my own experiences. The mainstream religions people promote religious ideology by giving guidelines and guide but In my spiritual life; I do not want anyone or anything between God and me to restrict my freedom to worship God. 2) We do not need any authorities to do good work. The god work is the good work always. In contrast; organised mainstream religions are claiming that they have the authorities to do God works as leaders so on. 3) God is not capable of doing wrong thing, change the past for us and create anything out of \textbf{nothing} for us. \textbf{Nothing} means not anything. So, even God is limited. The mainstream religious people believe that God is unlimited. 4) God wants us to take responsibilities for our righteousness life but not for all the consequences of our actions because they are continued to exist among us. So, How can god punish us for all our consequences? The mainstream religious people believe we are full of sins because of all our actions. 5) Freewill  is an illusion. People always choose the perceived path of greatest pleasure.  So, we do not have choices all the time. In contrast teachings of the mainstream religions are promoting people to do god's will always because we all have choices of freewill always. 6) We can not separate everything into groups. So, everything for good and evil and there's no success and failure for everything. If everything is real then real things can not be threatened. Once you come to understand that God/The Holy Spirit is in each of us, You will no longer need a Book to tell you how to live. Then why we need religious scriptures? The Virtue is the expression of the basic goodness in our actions. The Basic goodness is the fundamental worthiness of every individuals. We are worthy to God always in everything. 7) Beliefs in a cruel God makes a cruel man. No matter what; every living creatures has the right to live and What makes their life cheap? Everything depends on everything. \textbf{Nothing} too big or too small in value. We can not love and hate at the same time; Being a vegetarian means love without cruelty happily. The mainstream religious people are killing people and sacrificing animals in the name of God. They promote God's cruel punishments. The Punishment is endless for Sinners/Devil according to religious scriptures. But God is love always. Overcome hate with love. If all religions for peace, unity? No way. Because they are not for peace. 8) Well, The God gave us everything to go from moment to moment in our lives as we do our part  and pray only to thank god then the Love is in progress. The Love is always for everyone. We are always worthy of the God's love. Our greatest fear is; not to be loved by anyone but we are all loved by someone. When we eliminate all our unnecessary differences among us then true peaceful life is possible with the true love. If we can't find the peace within ourselves then we will never find it anywhere else. 9) This is the Fight for independence and freedom of humanity to worship God freely without religious guide and guidelines to restrict us. Unnecessarily, We do not want third party controls over us in anything ; especially in spirituality. 10) Revive Survive Thrive. Sincerely,  The Real Peacemaker against religious oppression.
