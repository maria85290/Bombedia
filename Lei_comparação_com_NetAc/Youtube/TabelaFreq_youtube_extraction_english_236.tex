  \cellcolor{green!27}\small While I am against \textbf{racism} in all forms against all people, China itself is the most \textbf{racist} country on Earth.  Even China's name in Chinese Zhonghou which is often translated as "Middle Kingdom" means a bit more than that: it means the country at the center of the world.  They believe, even the "\textbf{communist}" that China is still the center of the world.  And China has a police of Hanism, which Mao Zedong was actually against, that believes Han people and culture are the best.  China is putting into that idea into action against other Chinese \textbf{ethnic} groups, the Uygur being the best example but it can be seen in other groups as well.  China is also HIGHLY, I had to capitalize, \textbf{racist} against Africans instead of being open to them and other historically maligned groups and refugees.  They even have separate Chinese and \textbf{African} bathrooms and Chinese only restaurants IN AFRICA, sorry again for capitalizing.  I could go on and on but look it up yourself and see for yourself.  :)Just wait though, the replies will be full of Chinese 50cent army(a network of Chinese trolls paid by the government of China the equivalent of 50cents for every pro-China post) saying that US or Europe is \textbf{racist} for what it did in the past.  The key word is past unlike China who is doing it today and who denies it even happens when there is overwhelming evidence unlike the US and Europe who acknowledge it.  :)\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}African, Communist, Ethnic, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}7/248 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.823 \\  \hline

Murica saved them big league from the Japanese who had a fusion of modern and guerrilla training. China is like Iran was; personal freedom but no political freedom. As you know the definition of ill gotten gains; the only way China could further effect the wound from the repeated backstabs is too declare war on the U.S./Britain/Canada decimating themselves instantly without full sickle support. Don't know much about Thailand, Vietnam etc yet and don't hate anyone have a laugh; its funny too hear a Japanese guy talk shit about a Chinese guy \& vise versa.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small For me growing up in a poor \textbf{black} area, internalised \textbf{racism} is \textbf{black} children enacting gangster culture. The media overwhelmingly paints \textbf{black} people in negative ways and these children come to internalise these images, and it becomes part of their identity formation. Studious \textbf{black} people?? Hardly ever seen, so these kids become disengaged from education and are more interested in being a gangster because to them that is cool. That is expected. Humans are mostly conformist, just look at conformity experiments here on Youtube, you can have people stand up when a bell rings in a \textbf{doctors} office just because others are seen doing it repeatedly. I KNOW Of this form of \textbf{racism}  BECAUSE I LIVED THIS. I went to a majority \textbf{black} school and was educated in this rebellious lifestyle. The people around me aspired to be cool, they thought they were rebelling against a system that wasn't for them, but hey were only eleven, so I doubt they had a true understanding of what this meant, only that they should be lawless in order to rebel (they sometimes expressed this vocally). Having a competitive personality I was keen to impress my peers. It did not matter what was to be sought after, had the school culture been to strive for high achievement, I would have strived. That was not the culture, so the school was extremely bad, each of us trying to act as cool as possible. Oh you are going to skip class! Oh My God, you are soooo cool! They looked up to me and I was popular. \textbf{Black} children who wanted to work hard were absolutely ridiculed and bullied, I was certainly not going to be seem in that light! unfavourably! I realised it was a trap when my sister's year left the school and were still hanging out on the street. I wondered where their life would go? Was shocked and felt set-up. It was like smoke and mirrors that lead to no where. So I woke up and completed five years of work in one year to ensure I could pass school and get into college. I went to college and found the joy of learning - I got all A's. I was sad about all the years I COULD HAVE BEEN LEARNING, I am still sad up to this day! I went to university and now, existing in this world, I no longer feel empowered, I did as a rebellious youth, subscribing to that I felt alive! During this time I believed I lived in a post-racist society. Now I work in spaces where I am judged, looked down on etc. Without anyone having even spoken to me yet. It is one of the most draining and depressing experiences! It is the biggest system of oppression facing \textbf{black} people right now and it is one that has them killing each other or ended up incarcerated. So \textbf{black} people are not free if they internalise a culture that will have them locked up. They are still lynched if they are being killed, even if it is by someone that looks just like them. it is quite a genius system tbh, ruthless and insidious, but of course the most evil thing that exists to keep a people down!  Studying Psychology and understanding how we come to see ourselves and others come to see us, it fascinates me that this is the case. I have no doubt that this system has been designed intentionally, and you only feel the oppression of it when you do not enact it, when you uphold it you feel empowered, probably how white people feel on a day to day basis carrying out their norms. I feel more respected on gym days in a tracksuit than on work days in a suit. I am being unauthentic, not operating in my position of blackness. It is \textbf{crazy} because I used to actually see \textbf{black} people in a suit and judged them this way, shouting to them that they are a coconut. It is truly sad that \textbf{black} identity has been shaped as ghetto/gangster identity! I hope we can liberate our young people from this system of oppression.You simply don't understand the systems of oppression facing \textbf{black} people, including in \textbf{black} countries, where it is so underdeveloped that \textbf{black} students leave to come and help build up another \textbf{nation}. Intelligence is coding for by 100s of genes unlike phenotypes which is controlled by only a few. Intelligence does vary throughout the population but is not determined by skin colour. I have met and worked with smart and less intelligent people from ALL ethnicities. This is a weak argument for the state of \textbf{black} people. Scientist have even said there is no scientific basis to \textbf{race} because genes vary widely between people. I am sure you have all encountered people that look like you who have different personalities and levels of intelligence. Sometimes you can meet someone who doesn't even look like you and yet they have more in \textbf{common} with you personality wise...Some group claim to be so smart but are subscribing to outdated ideologies and helping to oppression other human-beings. The world disgust me, but I don't care about this, I care about fighting \textbf{racism} that affects \textbf{black} and brown people of colour.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Common, Crazy, Nation, Race, Racism, doctors & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Nationality - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}23/884 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.602 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Hey guys, just a little note here. This is a video about being \textbf{racist} towards Chinese, NOT about how China is \textbf{racist} towards others, so why those comments? I just dont understand. Guys, this immature, childish behaviour is just adding hate on hate, and we don't need that, especially in today's world. We have to work to build each other up, and NOT tear each other down. Just because some Chinese are \textbf{racist}, don't mean the whole group is that. This type of generalisation is a form of \textbf{racism} too, FYI. We all have a right to stand up for ourselves, as I'm doing now, as these Chinese students are doing. As long as its peaceful, harmonious and not being mean or rude. I'm not trying to defend the Chinese, or a particular group of people, I mean to say that for all of us on this earth, whether your Chinese, \textbf{African}, \textbf{Indian} or other nations/races. There is \textbf{racism} everywhere, not just in China or America, and each of our role is to stand up for what we believe in, in a ethically correct way, and disarming the hate, poverty and bad stuff that goes round, not adding fuel to fire. Think about my paragraph, and I hope you will reflect on it in a positive light.

Right after, they would instantly ridicule my name and proceed to make horrible and \textbf{racist} "chinese accents" to say my name and say ching chang chong.

I would say China is not a great country for immigrants, a lot of people are so used to live with only chinese people and they tend to have very little knowledge about other races. Some people are even just straight racists and it often upset me too! Sadly this problem is often ignored in the chinese society and I genuinely hope one day, as more chinese people go outside and see the world, we can tolerate diversity more and see that \textbf{race} doesn't matter!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Race, Racism & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/110 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.818 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I'm a native Chinese so I want to share real ideas with u. The reason behind this is quite simple. Think about those \textbf{African} descendants living in Guangzhou. These people are illegal immigrants but many of them do not have formal jobs in China. What's more, these people loves Chinese girls and persuade these girls to have sexes with them. (STD and HIV hah) So in Mainland we ban "\textbf{sex} deals, ganbllings, and drugs" heavily.. So I was educated at a early \textbf{age} to step away from \textbf{black} ones in China..

I just came back from China a couple of days ago on my first trip there and I wouldnt say that China was inherently \textbf{racist} but I would say that there was a weariness and suspicion of foreign people particularly \textbf{black} people. Its sad particularly given that \textbf{black} people dont have a history of oppressing and mass murdering other groups unlike other groups that I can mention and many \textbf{black} people that I know have a positive opinion of Chinese people and would go to China if it wasnt for concerns for the \textbf{racism} that they may face.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Nothing, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}6/162 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.704 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Black and Abroad in Asia  for the last 400+  years the people who built this country for free have been getting more than just named called. They have been burned alive and hung hourly. No Asian ever came out to protest in their favor. Instead the are proud to discard their native names and revert to themselves as kathy and Michelle. While blacks fought and died to get rid of miscegenation laws they still stood on the sidelines and waited until the dust settled to finally have an opportunity to Maryy Dave and chad only because the \textbf{black} civil rights movement prevailed . Furthermore, chocolate people continue to march in the streets protesting unarmed killings of chocolate people, and no where in those protest do you see Asian people helping. Maybe a few lynchings and live burnings will wake these people up.

So they keep insisting to the others like to the USA government and also to the AU government etc etc.. with very very derogatory comments like calling me as Phillipino maids, or they insulted me for having multiple plastic surgeries, until I have fairer skin than them. While I never have those procedures to make me more beautiful than the chinese. They also keep attacking me, like I have to obey them, they said if I indeed have that chinese ancestries, then I have to accept any chinese guys as my spouse, even the bad ones, the unwanted ones by them. Also, they to the Japanese, they lied that I am korean, or phillipinos, etc. But behind the Japanese, they mistreat me somekind like a slave, by calling me deserve to be treated bad due to I am Japanese, or American. On the other occassions, they insult me that because I am American in ethnicities origins, then they would send false reports to the USA government to reject me and to deny me. So.. very very severe.. without offences.. I admitted that fewer times, I confronted them politely.. ... then they again twisted the things against me.

The older generation (NOT ALL, and I don't like those \textbf{racist} older generation) tends to pressure their daughters to date East Asians only. I personally know many examples. 4. Most Chinese companies are merit-based, that's how they grow so fast. \textbf{Race} is irrelevant, unless they want to show people that they are tolerant, so they might hire a white or \textbf{black} guy to show the diversity.

The hotel doesn't want to go through the regulation registration works with local police and foreigner affair department. 2. Local security department has special arrangements for them. 3. At the moment for some reason they don't want to work with foreigners. This happens all over the world. Maybe they had bad experiences with foreigners due to difficulties of communication or customs or whatever.  None of these related with \textbf{racism}.

Hotels and airlines are trained to have these kind of situations and customers, this is a regular part of their business. And even chinese hotels see a lot of rude chinese customers who they really regret to have....guess what many chinese only hotels are regularly raided by civil dressed authorities to check on illegal activities including drugs usage and prostitution.... much less than in hotels that foreigners can stay .

What does Number of the experts in the country to do with the increasing numbers of problems that's experts caused? The only relevant data is the increasing number of the population of the experts.

How many foreigners arrived with tourist visa and get student visa and stays in China for a loooooong period of time making money in all kinds of jobs especially English schools even if they aren't native speakers? How easy for them to go to the best universities it is ridiculous. They can do whatever they want without the resident permit and switch visa types inside the county.

Surely u r doing it pretty well ... \textbf{nothing} wrong in it . but u missed the whole point (not surprising) is about being biased/unbiased. I stand up for my own country as well but i would'nt blindly try to cover some of the real life issues it has . And THATs what you are doing .... I come from a heavy populated country. And my parents didnt travel so much as I do. \textbf{nothing} u show on the report gives a justification for pooping and peeing in the airplane or throwing hot noodles at an air hostess's face... this is just that SIMPLE: rude behavior and as far as I know the Chinese culture, politeness is said to be a virtue and a character of the wise.... Guess guys forgot their own culture. Also everyone has a first time .... When young people in our country travel usually we are taught to "adjust" and "not do whatever I like" and i have seen the similar kind of upbringing in other countries as well. Your report says Chinese people in large numbers got exposed to foreign countries recently so they dont know how to behave.... And you complain foreigners in China doing what they want??? For a record never heard an Expat peeing in the aircraft or throwing noodles at an air hostess face in china.... switching visa in the country.... without leaving? where did u get this wonderful information my friend? or is it another of your walk down imagination lane ? those who come with a tourist visa/business visa/family visa and want to change their visa to a period longer than their intended stay HAS to do that EXITING the country and coming back and doing the FULL formality. Many do that by going back and forth hongkong. As per current rules a Z visa is allowed on arrival ONLY if the person has already been hired by a legal company in China and has all necessary documentation required by the Govt to give him a Z visa .... and Z visa is not a Work permit Those who do part time jobs while being on tourist and student visa are doing that ILLEGALLY those who are overstaying and living without a valid visa are ILLEGAL RESIDENTS.... And lets not dive into the Illegal immigrants in other countries.... So your country is no "easier" than other countries about visa. The process is much complicated than in other countries and yet has way lesser benefits for a legal expat.... also a worse quality of life .... that is what the link i sent u before where China ranked 41... dont understand what u wanna prove by giving back the same link focusing only about China.... The numbers and facts DONT change.... China Ranks 41 way behind other asian countries like japan taiwan singapore and this comparison is done based on parameters of expat life - numbers dont change.Next the hotel issue , travelling, cycling and hiking through different countries I can confidently say NO what you are saying hotels are the same every where ... no its not .... and a clear evidence . Are the rude chinese tourist effecting the behavior of how other host countries are providing service? Did the hotel where a bunch of rude chinese tourist shouted and nearly beat up the hotel authorities stop chinese tourists or foreign tourist in the future? did the airlines ban rude tourist? did the pyramid sites blocked chinese tourists? no they didnt .... and if China hotels are so sensitive that "as per your say" stopped taking foreigners because of an isolated case of foreigner causing some problem "which you have no proof of they did" then this is the problem with chinese hotels.... that doesnt happen around the world Finally color issue  and other countries have bigger issue. This is again so typical "blame it on others" yes others may have done it in the past . But we are living in the current world not in history... just as u said its 2018. and just this year I have travelled 3 more countries including 1 in asia and still there is the color issue .... blaming others with bigger problems doesnt solve problems in your own backyard. Dont know what you are trying to say about "non native speakers"??? whereas my point was how chinese schools and parents have this idea that "white foreigner" are true native speaking westerners and are selected to teach, whereas "\textbf{African} Americans" who are true native speakers with a teaching degree, also are considered "\textbf{African}" and not native speakers and refused for the job. THAT IS \textbf{RACIST} .... but you try to evade that topic and try to misguideSo in the conclusion 1) you are purposively misguiding and diverting topics 2) or you are confused and dont understand what the intent of the facts and the arguments wereAs I said in both the cases there is no point talking to a person who is pretending to sleep or purposively misguidingTo end it : I love it here , I love this country and the rich culture and true history and tradition. Love my girl and my other very close chinese friends. And no I dont hate chinese people but I hate people who initiate this kind of \textbf{racist}, rude and hate filled behavior and incidents Like any country China has also problems and yes these are some of the valid problems ... Redirecting them or acting \textbf{blind} wont change the facts....or fix them. Thats it!

I put up the incident of \textbf{african} american teachers who being elligible still doesnt get job because of skin color preference and that IS \textbf{RACIST}.  Showing appreciation does that mean i have to agree with everything that is unjust? Showing respect doesnt mean I need to keep my quiet and let anyone show their racial biased behavior on me!!! then why are these students putting up a video on youtube for and why r u commenting on it !!!!! then they should also just "show appreciation" to the country that allows them to live and study.....I have no intentions to "reform" but i have the right to speak experiences and facts.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I'm not gonna deny what you said, but I will offer another perspective. Asian countries are very homogenous, so they are surrounded by people who all speak the same language and who all 'look the same'. No thats not a \textbf{racist} joke. I mean that people have generally the same skin tone (usually pale in places like China and South Korea who idolize very pale skin, and more \textbf{tan} in Southeast Asia who don't seem to care about being pale as much), same dark hair, same dark eye color. And white, \textbf{black}, latino, russian, etc people don't really travel to the lesser known places of Asia (the tourist spots are usually the capitals of the country and such) so in those places they are not as exposed to other types of people. Meanwhile in the US and other places of the West like Canada and the UK, it's much more mixed. There are people of all kinds of \textbf{race}. So more people are exposed to different cultures. Asian countries are homogenous which makes it harder for them to experience different cultures, and that where we come in to educate them. But in places in the West like the US, it's inexcusable that \textbf{racism} is still prevalent because it's so much more mixed here and there are so many people here. You think we'd learn by now to stop being ignorant fucks and start thinking of all of us as one stupid species: humans.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Race, Racism, Racist, Tan & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Nationality - British & \cellcolor{green!5}5/243 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.058 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Carol Oh please, Asian people don't get a pass for being \textbf{racist} simply because they do not have racial diversity in their immediate surroundings. It doesn't take much to be pleasant to someone. And the fact that there is PLENTY of \textbf{racism} toward foreigners in Asian countries while they cry over hear when it's against them makes them a hypocrite, not naively innocent creatures who don't know better. Be the change you want to see, Asia. If you want to talk about illegal things going on in your countries by foreigners, stop violating U.S. immigration laws and doing other crimes while over here (like stealing - my bike was stolen by an Asian delivery guy and from what I heard that my dad told me when he reported it to the police, this is not unusual occurrence). The point is, if I grow up in a household of dark haired people, that doesn't give me the right to treat a blond in a bad way because I simply didn't grow up around blonds. Asians travel enough and have enough \textbf{common} sense to know how to behave without prejudging and yet they don't. Then they send their kids to America (after being raised by \textbf{racist} Asian parents) and expect to be treated in a way that they do not treat others in their country.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Jill The Lefevre You're right, they don't get a pass and it's not right at all. They're not innocent naive creatures, and many Asian countries really need to start changing their ideals to fit into the modern world. But they really just aren't as exposed to much racial diversity. And for something you know little about, things can get twisted. All in all, I just wanted to offer another perspective so people can maybe imagine how different the Western culture is from Asian cultures. I think what we need to keep in mind is they have a different history that affects them in different ways and affects the current generation's opinions on the world, and the US also has a very different history that has led us to where we are now. Also, anyone can be \textbf{racist} so we should not accuse an ENTIRE \textbf{race} for being \textbf{racist}. To be clear, I'm in no way saying any type of \textbf{racism} or just any sort of discrimination (whether it be against Asians, \textbf{African} Americans, Latinos, blonde people, or even people with glasses) is okay. The main goal is to stop it all. To stop the hate. And to do that we need to learn to understand each other, empathize with each other, and teach each other the different cultures of the world. So when OP blamed Asians for being \textbf{racist} to foreigners in their country, that's not okay. Not everyone is \textbf{racist} there. And when the people in the video took down those students' names, that wasn't okay.

Judge a person by their personality and actions, that's fine. But DO NOT bring \textbf{race} into it.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Race is a fictional doctrine created by a group of people (of Germanic heritage) for the purpose of adopting a hierarchal system where a small amount of people on top will be served by everyone underneath them. At the bottom is the largest pool of people and in the middle is tiers of people organized by their role of overseer over the people underneath them. The group defined the top of the pyramid as "White" and the bottom of the pyramid as "\textbf{Black}" and in between as stages of light to dark. The people in the middle are protectors of the top as they serve in roles of OVERSEERS over the lower classes. This system was known throughout Asia and Mexico as the Caste System, as was heavily religious based as the White was Pure and Closest to God and the \textbf{Black} was Wicked and cursed. Today it's the same system that serves as a model for all Corporations including "States".

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I believe the term you are looking for is "Pseudo-science".---American Anthropological AssociationStatement on "\textbf{Race}" and Intelligence(adopted December 1994)  [LINK] The American Anthropological Association (AAA) is deeply concerned by recent public discussions which imply that intelligence is biologically determined by \textbf{race}. Repeatedly challenged by scientists, nevertheless these ideas continue to be advanced. Such discussions distract public and scholarly attention from and diminish support for the collective challenge to ensure equal opportunities for all people, regardless of \textbf{ethnicity} or phenotypic variation.Earlier AAA resolutions against \textbf{racism} (1961, 1969, 1971, 1972) have spoken to this concern. The AAA further resolves:WHEREAS all human beings are members of one species, Homo sapiens, andWHEREAS, differentiating species into biologically defined "races" has proven meaningless and unscientific as a way of explaining variation (whether in intelligence or other traits),THEREFORE, the American Anthropological Association urges the academy, our political leaders and our communities to affirm, without distraction by mistaken claims of racially determined intelligence, the \textbf{common} stake in assuring equal opportunity, in respecting diversity and in securing a harmonious quality of life for all people.American Anthropological AssociationStatement on "\textbf{Race}"(May 17, 1998) [LINK] From its inception, this modern concept of "\textbf{race}" was modeled after an ancient theorem of the Great Chain of Being, which posited natural categories on a hierarchy established by God or nature. Thus "\textbf{race}" was a mode of classification linked specifically to peoples in the colonial situation. It subsumed a growing ideology of inequality devised to rationalize European attitudes and treatment of the conquered and enslaved peoples. Proponents of slavery in particular during the 19th century used "\textbf{race}" to justify the retention of slavery. The ideology magnified the differences among Europeans, Africans, and Indians, established a rigid hierarchy of socially exclusive categories underscored and bolstered unequal rank and status differences, and provided the rationalization that the inequality was natural or God-given. The different physical traits of African-Americans and Indians became markers or symbols of their status differences.As they were constructing US society, leaders among European-Americans fabricated the cultural/behavioral characteristics associated with each "\textbf{race}," linking superior traits with Europeans and negative and inferior ones to blacks and Indians. Numerous arbitrary and fictitious beliefs about the different peoples were institutionalized and deeply embedded in American thought.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Common, Ethnicity, Race, Racism & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}10/378 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.646 \\  \hline

More to the point, you're so busy misunderstanding what "heavy" means here, you're ignoring the fact that the post in question says subtitles in these cases are a joke and it is happening too often. But hey, why let somebody saying the same thing get in the way of some uncalled for righteous indignation eh?\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}1/107 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.935 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I'll say it again, I've seen British people from Cornwall, Scotland, Wales, N.I, Newcastle etc. subtitled whilst speaking English. This  has \textbf{NOTHING} to do with these people being of Chinese descent. It is just a trend that is sadly increasing.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!27}1/40 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.5 \\  \hline
