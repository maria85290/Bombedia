If she knows much \& learn alot from america, she can as well go help, clean her country, make it great again \& still return to the US. After all, no place on earth is like home. Instead of getting so angry, trying hard to control, manipulate \& detect to a country that took her in when she was in trouble \& in need.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Rep. Mrs. Omar - let us remind you that she is a US citizen, and in the free elections she was elected to the Chamber - she asks in public very simple and very honest questions . She noticed, because every American sees it, that in the USA one can examine - with surgical precision - lobbying in Congress for pharmaceutical, oil and armaments concerns. Rep. Mrs. Omar also noticed, because every American sees it, for unknown reasons it is forbidden to study lobbying in Congress for a foreign state - Israel. Rep. Mrs. Omar asks why? If pro-Israel organizations in the US lobby in favor of Israel in Congress, and if it is lawful, why can not speak publicly about it and study the scale of this phenomenon? And why the attempt to expect a fair and honest answer to the questions posed immediately is stigmatized by the accusation of anti-Semitism? I would like to remind you that the German Nuremberg Act of 1935 was called - rightly - anti-Semitism. Almost all the actions of the Third Reich on \textbf{nationality} issues were anti-Semitic and anti-Slavic.

Historically, the \textbf{Nation} of Judah and the \textbf{Nation} of Israel went to war against one another. Which \textbf{nation} is anti-semite there?

Private industry also existed in the Soviet Union since 1965, opposed to the Cold War narrative.I'm not a Socialist, although people don't even know the basics of it's philosophy.
