True Israel is still in this world today and is yet a people despised by many nations of the world. True Israel is the seed of Abraham, the first Hebrew and according to Gen. 15:13 and Duet. 28 is a people bought into another country which the Bible refers to as another Egypt, on ships enslaved by another \textbf{nation} and horribly mistreated until this day, held in physical and or \textbf{mental} captivity for 400 years (read the HR 1242 signed by Pres. Trump). If the Israel that the world knows does not fit these discriptions they are not, nor can they be True Israel.

I hope that you will revisit the question of abortion, which is a SOCIAL EVIL leading to the decimation of generations, not merely a question of a \textbf{woman}'s 'choice'.   The choice has already been made when the act which may lead to conception has begun, be that consensual or forced or somewhere in between (i.e. forced in all but name).   I am implying, of course, that the \textbf{woman} often has less than 50 percent involvement in the INITIAL choice, when she really ought to be in charge of the situation.   Very few women having that INITIAL choice would agree to forego the joys and pains of motherhood; on the contrary, many would willingly sacrifice their own lives for the sake of their children.    So shaming women, insisting that they bear the entire moral burden, is not the solution, because the decision is usually a collective one, enriching so-called 'doctors' (professional hitmen, in actuality).

Of a Hadeeth where the prophet tells us to hate Jews?Cause what I know is that they are people of the book, that they have their status in Islam, and that after the conquest of Jerusalem the Khalifa Omar Ibn Al Khattab allowed the Jews to go back to Jerusalem, and helped them do that.And I leave you with what the \textbf{Quran} had to say brother:\textbf{Quran} 3:199   And indeed, among the People of the Scripture are those who believe in Allah and what was revealed to you and what was revealed to them, [being] humbly submissive to Allah.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small +Rafi Adaman The real peace-loving Jews are those who have received Jesus as Lord and Messiah.   They spread peace as they proclaim the Gospel of Yeshua/Jesus among other Jews and to the nations.   Jesus secured peace between God and man by His death on the cross.   We become beneficiaries when we believe in Him.  Some call these people Messianic Jews; they used to be called Hebrew Christians.   The label does not matter so much.   They are often persecuted by their own unbelieving families when they turn to Christ.   But Christ definitely and uniquely fulfilled the Hebrew prophecies concerning the Messiah to come, hundreds of them.   So without doubt they have got the main message as it was intended.   Unfortunately the majority tendency in Jewish religion, even when Christ walked the earth, was insular and self-seeking.   If you deplore that self-seeking attitude, that narrow sort of \textbf{nationalism}, I hope that you will condemn it also among Palestinians, indeed within any nationalgroup on the face of the earth.   As for the 'world mafioso', there are many contenders for that title, not all of them Jewish!    There are also plenty of Anglos, Arabs, Chinese, whatever, whose god is money.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small You are dilusional. Completely indoctrinated by Ancient Hebrew mythology. Wake up and smell the coffee. Israel has only caused problems to the US in it's present form. Israel is a \textbf{racist} segregationist apartheid state that practices racial discrimination on a national scale. It violates the most basic civil rights of Palestinians and inflicts unimaginable humiliation and suffering upon them. By the way if you  love the Ancient Hebrews so much here are a couple of things you should know. Where do you think the Palestinians came from? Do you really believe that the Romans expelled every single Jews from the region in the Roman Jewish wars 2000 years ago with the fall of Jerusalem??? That is \textbf{nothing} but a myth. Many Jews across many towns embraced Roman and Greek culture, some even became Roman citizens and became loyal subjects of Rome. Many of these Jews refused to join the Jewish rebellions against Rome and instead were protected by the Romans against the religious zealots who did rebelled against Rome and would often attack them. Many of these Jews later became Christians and later converted to Islam once the Arabs arrived in the 7 the century. Even today 1/3 to 1/4 of all Palestinians are Christians. If you go to Israel today and you start digging in most archeological sites you will find evidence of a many Jews who embraced the Roman empire and it's Greek culture. You will find ruins of aqueducts, public pools, Roman public markets places, amphitheatres, public baths and so on. You will find evidence that many Jews embraced Roman culture, Roman life, culture and Roman rule. The Romans not only did not expell these Jews from the region, they protected them from the militant Jewish Zealots who would often attack them.Listen, there are three courses for this conflict, two Countries or one country. The Israelis can either have Apartheid South Africa or they can have Singapore. When Singapore became independent from the British they had three \textbf{ethnic} groups with three different religions who were killing each other. Buddists who were predominantly Chinese, Malay who were predominantly Muslim and Hindus who were predominantly Indians. Their prime Minister Kwan Lee, United them all and imposed affirmative action. He forced them to share everything in accordance with their population equally. Today Singapore is one of the richest country in the world, yet it's much smaller than Israel and it has no natural resources whatsoever. That is the best course of action for this conflict.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small +\@Andyman Sand The point is in the response itself.  If you want me to paraphrase or rephrase, I can try.   Somali culture, as I have heard, is inextricably linked with islam, to the extent that a Somali who leaves islam must leave the \textbf{ethnic} community in order to be safe.  As I have observed in my own town, Somalis are very 'sticky' socially, tending to segregate themselves.    Care for other members of one's \textbf{ethnic} community is not always a bad thing, so long as the sentiment behind it is not chauvinistic.   So I don't fault this \textbf{woman} for being pro-Somali, only for being anti-Jewish.   But islam is a cult based on lies, superstition, and coercion, so it undermines the Somali community morally, socially, and spiritually.   But those who are brainwashed may not realize that they have a problem, BECAUSE their brainwashing tells them that they are in the right.   One must realize also that islam has a low view of Jews.   In this sense antisemitism is 'baked into' Somali culture.   One cannot expect much better from this \textbf{woman} because of her background.   She may apologize, but only to the extent that she escapes trouble.   This \textbf{woman} can only be redeemed in the same way as others are, by repenting and believing in the Lord Jesus Christ.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnic, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}5/216 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.315 \\  \hline

Why does Ilhan Omar approve of walls to protect people from her home country of Somalia but not to protect other Americans?BTW, last summer, Peggy Traeger Tierney was told in writing, by a \textbf{woman} named Elizabeth Paulson of the Minnesota Liberty Alliance, that the Somali elders requested the wall from the Democrat leadership, to protect themselves from their own "radicalized" youth, and had also reached out to the Minnesota GOP for help. The security upgrades were discussed at a May 7, 2018 meeting with Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Ward 6 City Council member Abdi Warsame.'I think it's worth it because I think our [Somali] elders need to be secure. They need to feel comfortable, and if it costs that much, that's fine. I don't think the money matters, I think their safety is paramount," Abdi Warsame said.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small +amrit bansal You imply that the Israeli state requires apologists.   Why should it, any more than any other existing state?   'Legitimacy' of states can be understood objectively in two ways:  as an expression of 'de facto' political reality, and as an expression of God's sovereign will being carried out upon the canvas of history.   The Israeli state fits both criteria, because (a) it exists; and (b) it exists according to the will of God.   Whether you think that God permitted it to exist, contrary to His own distinct preference, or DESIGNED it to exist as part of a larger fulfilment of His promises made to Abraham through Isaac and Jacob, is another matter.   Your own subjectively anti-Biblical view seems evident.  (Romans 13:1b)  'For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are established by God.'   (Acts 17:26-27)  '.........and He made from one man [one blood] every \textbf{nation} of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined their appointed times and the boundaries of their habitation.'   People should be careful of using 'legitimate' political criticism as a \textbf{thin} cloak for antisemitic hatred, which in my opinion is EXACTLY what Ms. Omar has done.
