  \cellcolor{green!5}\small She wasn't even \textbf{fat}, but I completely understand the feeling of being the chubbier sister and is horrendous.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small To be honest I don't think she isn't exercising but the fact that her face is so \textbf{chubby} tells me she got \textbf{fat} relocation again and again and again, and then she started exercising. But no she didn't lose weight all naturally, otherwise her face wouldn't be so \textbf{chubby}. She definitely got injections for under chin and neck \textbf{fat} removal , fillers obviously even on her jaw. Good job indeed but don't tell me for a sec this is just gym and kitchen tactics. It's not. I train since I was 11 and this body isn't all natural.

Alex is the one, why her middle name Alexandra??? Explain that. Kris know Khloe isn't his, she stay quiet because she's too white, taller, dirty blonde and her nose got big, when she got older, took nose surgery, I felt bad Khloe doesn't want to know DNA, she ripped off document, Kris seem relieve not want her to know, keep last name, Khloe prefer  Kardashian but that's BS, Khloe Alexandra Roldan period! If she wasn't cheat, would have Robert Jr then meet Bruce Jenner, Kris would have five not six. I guarantee, Khloe is not HIS, she's NOT Kardashian. I bet two ssters knew but ignore...but Robert Sr wrote his own secret journal book, his 2nd wife has it.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I'm not surprised that Khloe Kardashian ended up getting plastic surgery like most of her family. The only two that look normal and not like freaks are Courtney and Kendall. The interesting thing to me is that Courtney is the oldest sibling and she looks the best out of all of them. She's had more kids than any of them naturally did either. So that just shows that plastic surgery isn't always the best decision. Imagine what Kim is going to look like when she's 50 years \textbf{old}. She better get that stuff taken out of her ass because it's just going to continue to look worse.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}1/107 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.935 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I don't know why the Kardashians don't just give up the charade. Obviously Khloe is not a Kardashian. If you look at the pictures with her sister she looks like a freaking Giant. Everything about her is different. Her hair color, her eye color, her body and even her skin color. She's clearly not Armenian. You can see that her sisters look like the Father Robert Kardashian. Khloe looks \textbf{nothing} like him. I think it's funny that they try to make us believe that she's related. Really, they don't have to tell us anything they don't want to but since they put their lives out there in almost every way including trying to say that Chloe is Robert's child then they should understand why people are going to question that. Kris Kardashian had affairs in the past when she was married to Robert Kardashian so why is it such a far stretch that she might have gotten Knocked Up by somebody else? I'm actually surprised that she doesn't look more African-American. They all seem to like to date them. Even the mom has followed suit.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}1/185 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.541 \\  \hline

You are the Youngest of the Kardashians  yet you are tall as a man. Let me tell you, I  have seen pictures of you and  Tristan  standing and he is not too much taller than you. Strange  since he is a basket  ball player the men tend to be exaggeratedly  tall.

I'm 6 feet and my husband is 5'10 he has no problem with my height he chased me for months before we dated and got married.

My point is not that Jordan is a " SHRIMP" In your own words. I was not speaking of Jordan or yourself .  My opinion In this is the perception  I see that her family the \textbf{woman} are all shorter than she is what are the chances?  Her skin color, hair color, and eye color are different.  Yes I find it strange. A stranger thing is that she is taller than her brother.  And you, you answered...reminds me of the sayin, if the shoe  fits then wear it.    LOL YOU  SILLY!!  I  do believe that I directed my question at KLOHE  not you? And yes it is extremely  difficult  to  understand, the fact that, these men, the  basketball players  are exaggeratedly tall. They almost appear unreal. So to see a \textbf{woman} kiss this athlete with such ease... My point is I DON'T believe  all that I hear!!! If you are 6 feet tall, well  so you say. And as far as how tall  KLOHE   is.  So you say. IT'S NOT A FACT. how do you know? Are you her best friend?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Shaming tall \textbf{woman} huh lol.  Listen, I  do not hold the power in my hand to shame others. If  I speak of an issue, there is a  reason behind it.  Again my comment was not directed at you.  This brings me to my next point.  Society at best has to depend on others  to exist.  Eat food to feel energy,  water to stay hydrated, sleep to not be tired, watch television shows to not be bored, work to have money, gasoline to fill thank for transportation etc. The list goes on. Now you are saying other must say certain words to make you feel good? That is ridiculously shameful...lol Where does the freedom of speech go? The sence of expression . You see I am not   responsible  for  your self esteem! That sounds twisted to me. You see I know who I am what I stand for, what I like, what I DON'T so all other opinions about me Will slide off.  Others DON'T influence my core believes and furthermoreDepending on others to make me happy!  If  what they say about me makes me sad or mad that sounds like it would be a personal issue.  If that happened I would have to see a shrink.  The whole Klohe Kardashian  thing is this.  They are  public figures.   They base their existence on others.   There for my point is valid.   Bottom line you or other should not depend on me to feel better or worse. That is my humble opinion it might not be humble yet it is mine.  BTW That word you chose to use "Shaming" It sounds like you got that from the media, tv, internet media, magazines. I  will no longer respond to your comments.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/288 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.347 \\  \hline

I will say that it would be rather ridiculous to be jealous of a MAN POSING AS A \textbf{WOMAN}.   WHEN I MY SELF IS A \textbf{WOMAN} A REAL ONE NONETHELESS!!!  Jealousy  is not part of my repertoire... I often wonder.    This comment was not directed towards you.  Why,  then  do you bring it upon yourself to answer...  Be familiar with the famous saying "IF THE SHOE FITS THEN WEAR IT"  ( laughing quietly to myself)... I will tell you what it means... so you yourself  must be a man POSING as a \textbf{woman}.
