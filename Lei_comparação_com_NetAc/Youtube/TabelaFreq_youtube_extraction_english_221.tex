  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I don't think the \textbf{race} industry has done us any favours. It keeps the pot boiling and is a barrier to the natural process of integration by keeping us thinking in terms of \textbf{race}. I try not to think in this way but sometimes feel that there is something hovering over my head waiting for me to slip up. This makes people defensive and reinforces difference in an unhealthy way. The best way not to be accused of \textbf{racism} is not to mix with other races and that sucks.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Race, Racism & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/89 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.371 \\  \hline

I don't see white basketball players crying over all the \textbf{black}  basketball players being picked over them simply because they are \textbf{black}.  No. Because the \textbf{black} players are just better.  That's  all.   A cop pulls u over. Follow his or her directions.  Get pissed after and deal with them. Not during.  Whites know this. And funny fact MORE WHITES are killed by cops then blacks.  But the news doesn't want that known because  well...It doesn't make ratings.  So wake up \textbf{Black} America.

All because I have a differing opinion to someone else's. \textbf{Racism} really does suck for anyone who is a target. \textbf{Black}, white, Hispanic, etc. It's not exclusive to one \textbf{race} or another.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I appreciate your effort, but this was a very short video on such a topic with a long memory.------------------ Also, there is a lot of internecine discrimination among \textbf{black} people themselves in America, especially in New York, which is confusing. They look down heavily against England and blacks who are from, represent, or speak highly of it, are often looked down upon as traitors. ---------------------------Natural \textbf{racism} in the States, is slick, sickly and slyly worked in such a manner where one needs to really decipher what is transpiring. The workplace is set up that the whites can "play" blacks against each other in an astute and slick manner. They know where their bread is buttered. They really long to get a social taste of the other sides "greener" pastures.

I think that the commenter DeeperThanMyThoughts explained very well and gave excellent examples of the racism/discrimination that is blatantly apparent; however, I will offer a few more on a personal level.A few years ago, there was a school shooting a few miles away from where I live. Two young white boys (10 and 12 years \textbf{old}) killed 7 people, teachers and students, and injured many others. They were sent to a juvenile detention center until the \textbf{age} of 18 when they were released and their records expunged because they committed the mass shooting as minors.  I have a nephew who was an accomplice in a robbery at the \textbf{age} of 16. The store owner or cashier was killed during the robbery.  My nephew was tried as an adult and sentenced to 40 years in prison because he refused to say that he killed the man. He would have gotten a lighter sentence if  he had said he did it. He is still in prison and is now about 37 years \textbf{old}.  Now don't get me wrong, he should have been punished for his involvement in the crime and may even deserve the 40 years, but you are telling me that those two boys who killed 7 people should have gotten only 6-8 years.If that's not a good enough example for you, how about this true story.  Two years ago, my nephew who was on the high school football team was practicing his drills in his backyard when he was suddenly tasered by the police.  What excuse did the police give? He looked like the suspect, who from my understanding, was actually a white man. Now, my nephew is dark-skinned and is nowhere near white not even in the palm of his hands or his eyes.  Imagine if they had used guns instead of a taser? My nephew would be dead. They messed up his arm, and he was not able to use it for weeks.One more for you, I visited a predominantly white school district to give a presentation. On the entire staff, there was only one \textbf{black} person, a man. His job was in-school suspension or security; he was also a probation officer. I don't believe that they could not find a qualified \textbf{black} person who could teach.Is this demonstration enough?\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Black, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!5}6/423 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.418 \\  \hline

In a sense, "the right to discriminate" is part of a ideological vein in American society that shows up in other issues, imo.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small +Scott A With all due respect, I have to disagree. I would agree that comparatively, \textbf{racism} is far less openly prevalent than it was in the 1960's and prior. But to say "A white and a \textbf{black} man with similar skills, language, behavior, grooming and dress will 100 be treated equally in almost any conceivable situation," that simply is not true. I don't know what your racial background is or your geographic location, but that statement is purely your opinion based on your perspective, upbringing and geographic location within the States, but that does not make it a national reality. The fact is there are numerous studies about the racial discrepancies in prison sentencing for the similar criminal acts, racial discrepancies in hiring for certain positions, regardless of educational background, etc.  I will say open \textbf{racism} is less prevalent in certain parts of America than others. People have a habit of labeling the United States as if every city is the same, but the fact is every city, state, etc. has a different history and different social realities for people who reside in them. Even within the same states, cities have very different cultures. Los Angeles and San Francisco for example are both in California, but are very different cities from each other and have different social realities based on that history.There are Americans who move from one region of the United States to another and have as much of a culture shock in the different lifestyles of different places as they would if they had moved to a foreign country. You can't say the social realities of a person in a city in the state of Illinois would be the exact same as the realities of someone in a city in Mississippi.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small "\textbf{Racism}" against whites is simply name calling and words, with little to no action or act of power against whites; \textbf{racism} against nonwhites has been and is more than just words or name calling and has had much greater devastating effects against nonwhites, even up to now. \textbf{Racism}, as you call it, against whites is no way comparable the other way around. It is largely systemic. Whites not only have a great rap sheet of hating, feeling, or saying hateful things about other races, but they have demonstratively made it clear about how they feel about nonwhites as well on a large scale, historically, and today! They have a history of harming nonwhites, whereas nonwhites history of harming white people is a drop in the bucket, not saying it's right at all, but making such a comparison is a false equivalency. So when nonwhites begin to react from being on the receiving end of historical violence and hate from white people it is understandable of how it came about and what fuels it.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small rdokoye Of course i'm generalising, but those generalisations have a genuine biological basis. There can be extremely intelligent Africans and extremely stupid Europeans. I'm not denying that fact, but speaking GENERALLY - what I say holds true.Europeans have lived in a temperate climate for tens of thousands of years which makes living there much easier than somewhere like sub-saharan Africa. Obviously, the relative ease of living is going to give rise to more innovation and advancement. Europeans are more intelligent because their environment allowed for it.There's a reason that the average \textbf{African} person's IQ is significantly lower than the European's.For Europeans living in Africa: their presence is necessary for the development of Africa.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Tate, "a lack of discrete boundaries doesn't negate the fact that there is a clear differentiation between some peoples."That is the problem with you argument. The difference isn't CLEAR. You can't tell what genes somebody has for temper, intelligence, cooperativeness, creativity etc from just looking at their physical exterior such as skin color or hair style. Two people could have equal mix of \textbf{black} and white and look completely different on the outside. E.g. there are cases of white couples getting a \textbf{black} kid and blacks getting a white looking kid.\textbf{Racism} is about judging people on how they look on the outside, which has little to do with how they are on the inside. "a lack of discrete boundaries doesn't negate the environmental conditions that different peoples developed in"You show you didn't understand what I meant with discrete boundaries. Your problem is that you think that humans split into these separate groups which lived completely independent in a narrow geographical area developing particular traits. That is not how it worked. Sure people DID develop certain traits over time, such as Europeans got white around 10 000 years ago, which is fairly recent. But all along people were shuffled around and mixed all the time. Human migration and mixing happens at a faster pace than genes change. "by the way: i'm not trying to "solve" \textbf{racism}. i'm saying that there is no point in lying to ourselves and pretending that everyone is equal."That isn't my issue with \textbf{racism}. The problem isn't that people pretend we are all the same. The problem is racists pretending we are far more different than we ACTUALLY are. "i don't think that all indigenous europeans are inherently superior to everyone else because they are white; it's a superiority that has been allowed to develop and be learned and passed on for thousands of years because of the environmental conditions of europe."Western culture of course has had a strong edge over others, and I am not a cultural relativists. I do in fact hold the rather non-PC view that western culture is in sum superior to most other cultures. HOWEVER I don't associate that with whiteness as you seem to do. Culture doesn't get absorbed by genes. Until proven otherwise I would assume that blacks, asians, arabs or whoever who get raised in a western culture by western parents will be the same as white westerners.Of course we have to a very small degree been able to test that, because most non-whites in the west don't get raised by westerners and \textbf{racism} is still a potent enough force to push people down who look different.We do have historical precedence to suggest that they will likely be the same however. In earlier times when Irish, Jews and Italians faced a lot of \textbf{racism} in the US, they did poorer than others on most metrics. Irish were known as lazy, quarrelsome drunkards. In fact Irish were in the 1800s considered a lesser \textbf{race} then blacks by many. "\textbf{Black} man preferred, Irish need not apply" was not an uncommon sign in those days."it's silly to expect people who have been living a completely \textbf{alien} lifestyle since humanity came about to behave as westerners would in a world created by the white man."Why, the adopted kids raised by whites I know, have no obvious different behavior from whites.Your \textbf{racist} thinking is exactly there is a problem for people looking different to live together. You use your own prejudice and the problems it cause as an excuse to advocate for your own \textbf{racism}. It is completely circular logic. It is like mistreating your children until they behave badly and they use that as an excuse to treat them even worse.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small +AlphaBlackAce Here are just a few things.  1) \textbf{Black} American men do not promote phenotypically-looking \textbf{black} women (like Lupita Nyong'o or Danai Gurira).  Whenever you see \textbf{black} men in the media (or even regular \textbf{black} guys), they tend to be with white or racially-ambiguous women.  If you do a search on YT for something like "I love \textbf{black} women," the majority of videos are by mixed and other non-\textbf{black} men.  There are a small handful of \textbf{black} guys that started posting videos, however.  Even they admit they started doing it because \textbf{black} men don't promote \textbf{black} women, and it makes them look bad.2) \textbf{Black} men don't build or provide for \textbf{black} women.  \textbf{Black} women start and own the majority of the businesses in the \textbf{black} community, according to the U.S. Census (60+).  \textbf{Black} men also don't provide for \textbf{black} women.  Part of the reason \textbf{black} men can't provide is because they are allergic to education.  \textbf{Black} men don't seem to realize that we live in a technologically-based society, where degrees have become the standard.  I'm from a small town in the south and live around a bunch of white people.  The only thing they hire uneducated, \textbf{black} people for is fast food -- and those jobs typically go to women.This is why you have so many \textbf{black} women going to school and bragging about their degrees and what not.  \textbf{Black} American women make up approximately 70 of the \textbf{black}, educated population.  If the \textbf{black} \textbf{woman} is poor, she basically knows that she has to go to school and possibly even start her own business to make it big.  Where I live at (smaller town in the south), all of the medical \textbf{doctors} at my local hospital are \textbf{black} women.  \textbf{Black} women going into healthcare of \textbf{mental} health is popular where I live.  Because the \textbf{black} men are uneducated, they haven't found a space for themselves.  Even when it comes to manual-labor jobs, white men prefer to hire other white men or Indigenous Mexicans (have a reputation for doing really good work, working hard, and working for less).  The last time we hired a plumber (white), he said that his family had been doing it and construction for 3 generations.  He said they keep it "all in the family."  In truth, the Indigenous Mexicans have more opportunities (have their own restaurants in addition to getting hired to do manual labor) and are able to better provide than the average \textbf{black} man.  It"s sad.3) \textbf{Black} men don't value marriage -- even though it's one of the easier ways for blacks to have access to capital).  Other communities value the institution, and white people are more likely to lend a \textbf{black}, married couple money and all of that stuff.  Yet, the majority of \textbf{black} American men (about 55) NEVER marry.  If you think this is just a \textbf{black} man-\textbf{black} \textbf{woman} issue, it's not.  Even when \textbf{black} men do get married and marry outside of their \textbf{race}, their divorce rates are in the 80+ percentile.  The Census also tracks this.  So, there are just a few examples.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small +AlphaBlackAce Your question points to your mentality and is part of the reason why the \textbf{black} community is in the state it's in -- why no one respects \textbf{black} American men.  We live in a patriarchal society, where men have an economic advantage over women and where men of other races promote, build, provide for, and protect their women and children.  \textbf{Black} men want respect but refuse to do the things that men of other races do.  The worst part is that they still expect \textbf{black} American women to do the same things for them that women of other races do for their men.

Furthermore, how you feel about and carry yourself doesn't necessarily correlate to how people actually perceive and/or treat you.

Of course, lets also not forget when White farmers take land, legally, and actually make it into something useful, whereas 99 of the land is left to ruin out of neglect, but then Blacks suddenly want that tiny 1 for themselves and end up throwing the entire farm away and begging for whites to come back once they have fallen in famine.

If we are to excuse our actions based on past injustices indefinitely, there will never be peace.  That is why the Yugoslav civil war happened. People could not get over the injustices of the past.Not to mention that grabbing white farm land in Zimbabwe was momentously stupid. They took farm land from people with long experience in running farms well and gave them to people with \textbf{zero} experience causing an agricultural collapse in Zimbabwe.Of course I am totally open to broker some sort of settlement over past injustices. E.g. if too much of the land is held by whites, then negotiate some sort of compromise where they have to give away parts of the land or there is a \textbf{transition} period, where they get some compensation and have to train blacks to farm the land.It makes no sense to be so preoccupied with "justice" that you do things which lead to "justice" along with more abject poverty. White Europeans sure colonized and exploited Africa, but they also built up infrastructure and industries which they knew how to manage. It was very stupid to kick out the people who knew well how to manage things effectively. It caused severe economic decline for many \textbf{African} countries.A better approach would be to try to find some compromise.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Pittsburgh Bear ok I'm going to go through and respond to your comments one by one. I would like to first start off by saying as I've thoroughly read your messages I hope you read mine and realize I'm trying to have a discussion based on fact but at the same time I can only speak about my experiences as a \textbf{black} \textbf{woman} in America. In general there are more people out of prison than in, but that's just \textbf{common} fact that not everyone is a criminal or gets caught. With that being said 1 in 5 \textbf{black} people are jail. You know how many \textbf{black} people have been falsely accused and jailed? You know how many have been released. It is naive to say that all \textbf{black} are in jail for the sole reason of committing a crime. I know it's hard to wrap your head around but I literally just witnessed to \textbf{black} men being arrested in Starbucks for waiting for their friend. Mind you they're two real estate brokers minding their business, but the manager and barista were uncomfortable which is an exact quote and called the cops. The criminal justice system is supposed to convict those who have committed a crime, but it's definitely not always effective. Their are people who get away with crimes, and people who are wrongly imprisoned because they can't afford a decent lawyer or trumped up charges.I'm not sure if you're aware of what the war on drugs actually is based off your statement but I'll assume you realize it's the American govt way to put an end to illegal drug trade and discourage people from using drugs. It's never been particularly effective except in the way that it's targeted \textbf{black} people. We can go back as far as the Nixon administration to his aides admitting that the war on drugs targeted \textbf{black} people. The war on drugs is the progenitor for our lopsided criminal justice system. The contra cocaine trafficking during the Raegan administration is another way the war of drugs targeted \textbf{black} communities. Drugs were literally taken by the CIA our if one country and shipped into the Bay Area and introduced into \textbf{black} communities. Then \textbf{black} men were arrested and imprisoned at disproportionate rates because of bill Clinton. To say that \textbf{black} people are more likely to do drugs is false. There is literally no scientific evidence supporting your claim that \textbf{black} people are more likely to do crack or any other drug. So I would like to see your support for such a statement. Also this is the first of many times that you deem something as \textbf{racist} that's not actually \textbf{racist} which leads me to believe that you don't understand the definition. \textbf{Racism} is the belief in the superiority of one \textbf{race} over another, which often results in discrimination and prejudice towards people based on their \textbf{race} or \textbf{ethnicity}. Although now a days we see it more in an ideological form from views left over from or systematically with policies like war on drugs. Systematically isn't exclusive to laws and policies I've experienced it more at the institutional level. Gentrification exists so their is segregation in the housing market. That is a well known fact. Only 10 of people in the United States leave their socioeconomic status to a higher one. That means 90 of people stay the same or go lower. That's all Americans not just \textbf{black} folks. If you look at that 10 that leave their socioeconomic status for a better one 8.4 of those numbers are Asians and Caucasians. Only 1.3 is \textbf{black}. In a population of 326 million people in which 13.3 of those people are \textbf{black} (approx 43 million) only 1.3 improve that's only (563 thousand people). That's disproportionate lower than if you do the math for other minorities. Just because the federal housing act exists does not mean everyone observed the law. If people didn't experience discrimination based on their \textbf{race} this wouldn't be a law, and it wouldn't be a law that was still in effect today if people still didn't break it. You're right police brutality isn't just a \textbf{black} issue, but it affects \textbf{black} community at a higher percentage. A lot of \textbf{black} shootings are caused by \textbf{racism} whether you want to believe it or not because the assumption that a \textbf{black} man has a gun when often he doesn't is a sign of \textbf{racism}. Why is it that cops can disarm and arrest white men who are resisting arrest but when it comes to \textbf{black} men they're shot. Also please show me the law that says resisting arrest is punishable by death. Resisting arrest does not mean you can take your gun out and kill someone. The man who was killed in his backyard in Sacramento wasn't doing anything, Alton Sterling told the police officer he was reaching for his permit to show he was allowed to have the gun after the officer asked him to and he was still shot. If you can't see how these examples are examples of \textbf{racism} within the cop community then I would be willing to find another way to explain it to you. Their are \textbf{racist} people embedded with in our justice system, and again it's naive or ignorant probably the latter for you to believe that criminal justice system works 100 of the time because it actually hasn't. This is what people mean when they systemic for of \textbf{racism}. There are people within institutions holding the power that are \textbf{racist} and use that power against the \textbf{black} community. It is a systematic form of oppression. Now that we have an understanding of systematic \textbf{racism} you can see how this phrase is applied to the job market. \textbf{Racism} only affects those who have been oppressed. In America, the only white people that have oppressed are poor white people. Other than that white people are not oppressed and are not affected by \textbf{racism}. I once applied for a job and didn't receive a call back, when a reapplied a month later using my middle name which is French I not only received the call back but the job. My entire application was the same only my name changed. I also didn't accept the job. If I do a phone interview or Skype interview I try to make it so people can't hear my accent and they give me a fair chance. I'm not the first nor last \textbf{black} person who has had to do this several of friends have to do this and that's because some employers have pre-conceived notions about \textbf{black} people. I've already addressed the groups of people that have experienced \textbf{racism} within America. I can't speak for those outside of America.  Now everyone has had different experiences and if you've never experienced \textbf{racism} then you're lucky and blessed and I hope you never experience it. If you have then I want you to remember where you were, how it impacted you, and who it was. Take that feeling and realize millions of Americans feel that way in a daily basis. I don't know if you're \textbf{black}, I don't know if you're American, but we're all human and we will always share that. For you to come here and discount and invalidate their feelings and opinions is not how we grow as a society especially while uplifting your own salacious and false alternative facts. So please if you're going to have discussion about something of this magnitude remember your entitled to an opinion but that doesn't make it a fact.

However, \textbf{racism} in the UK is very much systematic and filters through in a clandestine approach. You might not have police shooting you dead in your car unarmed, but you certainly as a \textbf{black} person are being profiled. I also think its easy to over look that unless you live in a major city or diverse town that \textbf{racism} is more rife outside those cities.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small "However, \textbf{racism} in the UK is very much systematic and filters through in a clandestine approach"I don't like this type of thinking.  You're basically just asserting that there 100 is a \textbf{racist} boogeyman out there, even if we can't measure his effects, and that I should just trust your intuition. It's exactly this intuition that I'm resisting!You're right, I do live in a big city and perhaps \textbf{racism} is worse outside. It most likely is. How much worse and whether even that is worth discussing is a separate issue however. But here is what I do know: Most \textbf{black} people, and the sort of people that complain about \textbf{racism} like Kaluuya does, grow up in the big cities anyway!I grew up in a very multicultural area and I can tell you that, sadly, many of the kids that had disciplinary problems or were involved in gang culture were \textbf{black} students. \textbf{Black} people all know that one of the biggest issues in the \textbf{black} community is the lack of good male role models for the young men. Unfortunately, without fathers to set an example, they end up admiring and inspiring to be the gangsters they know from the ghetto streets. I've seen it happen numerous times. But this isn't an exclusively \textbf{black} issue (although it is a particularly big issue amongst blacks) as we have the same problems with white working class "chavs" too. In fact, here in the UK, the worst performing group at educational attainment are white working class boys! What kind of a \textbf{racist} society is that?With regards to the police profiling, I've never been stopped by the police and neither have any of my \textbf{black} friends. I assume that's because I don't look like I'm causing trouble. My point is that, just because \textbf{black} people are dis-proportionally stopped by the police, it doesn't mean that the police are being \textbf{racist} if you take into account the fact that gang culture, which is exactly what police profiling is fighting against, is dis-proportionally \textbf{black}. If you go to the north of England where there are a lot of white working class people and a similar youth gang culture, you will find the same disdain for the police albeit without the racial component. There they talk about it from a class struggle perspective instead. Let me give you another example. Let's say that south east Asian people are dis-proportionally arrested for human trafficking.

YES! Men being negatively effected in the ways you listed actually IS a result of \textbf{sexism}! Women are perceived as less likely to commit a crime because they're "too weak" and this indirectly harms men. Men also do not have support systems for \textbf{mental} illness because of toxic masculinity, which is basically the male version of \textbf{sexism} but mostly self-inflicted. As for the other stuff, I can speak for asian people tending to make more money than white people because we are culturally raised to not put focus on hobbies and artistic passions and focus on a job that makes money while white parents are more likely to support their kid's decision regardless of the field.

The idea that society makes men be less emotional completely ignores the science of Evolutionary Biology. Furthermore Men also have different biological pleasure receptors than women do. When women are rewarded for being caregivers they receive far more pleasure hormones than if they become breadwinners. For example women entering advanced fields in Law drop out at enormous rates at around \textbf{age} 30 because they don't find pleasure in it. It's also why women enter nursing, teaching, and other such fields in far bigger numbers than men.

For me I think the important thing is acknowledging what has occurred. We can't simply ‚Äòmove on' and start fresh without making up for what we have done. When I was in school in Germany, I found out that they had classes where they were taught not to feel guilty about what their predecessors have done, and that those atrocities are not their burden to bear. They've done all they can to make sure their modern society is a more united one. So when you see Germans commenting on how \textbf{crazy} the Trump ordeal is and how those Americans that vote for him can't see how their falling right into the situation the german people found themselves in in the rise of world war 2, that's what I mean. We need to seek forgiveness before we can move on and unite otherwise this is what we see happening. The german civilisation have learned never to allow that again.

And yes, there is a minority population of white muslims, but they do not face the same level of prejudice as muslim people originating from north Africa or the middle east.
