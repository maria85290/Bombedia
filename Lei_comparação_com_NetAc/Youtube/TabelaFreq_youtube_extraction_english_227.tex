I never said otherwise.  There are however, people working.  How did they get the work?  Get qualified, get work experience, get the job, perhaps start at the bottom AND turn up everyday, on time for work and for goodness sake actually work hard. (knew an Aboriginal liaison officer who was supposed to give a lecture to government officers and he actually went walkabout for two weeks.  What a wanker.  He single handedly taught an entire batch of government officials what Aboriginals were like).    Look around, there are people who will do the jobs no one else will and work their way up.  Many work part time/casual and do 2 or 3 jobs.  Gone are the day when you could quit one job and walk into a full time job the very next day.  I understand that.  In fact, the unions won so many rights for the workers in Victoria that all the jobs have gone overseas.  That sucks but Australia has no choice but to compete internationally with the world.  We can't keep borrowing either or we will end up like Greece, Portugal, Italy, Spain etc broke and paying just interest on the loans.  There is no more money on tap.
