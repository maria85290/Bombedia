  \cellcolor{green!5}\small This is why community is so important.  We have let community slide over recent decades.  People don't connect with their neighbours much any more.  It's important to do it though.  The lonely \textbf{elderly} people in this film are just examples, they are a drop in the ocean.  In your community right now, there will be people like this.  Alone, struggling.  We can all help though.  A visit, a kind word, a favour.  Offer to tidy their garden, take in their shopping, ask if they need anything fixing, chat to them for 5 minutes.  All very simple things we can all do with very little effort, but things like this make a huge life-changing difference to these people.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small My maternal grandfather passed away in 2006 and my grandmother has been living with my family since then. Until nowadays my aunts and uncle would take turns taking care of her. They did what they can as son and daughters. Honestly I'm happy seeing my grandmother like this. She's happy surrounded by company. My paternal grandparents are doing fine. My youngest aunt and her family lives together with them. I'm happy that both sides of the family takes care of their parents well. But then I look at myself, the eldest son of the family. No jobs to support myself. Living paycheck to paycheck through making arts. I'm afraid that I can't support my parents when they're \textbf{old} and retired. I have siblings. Two are working and another is studying to become an engineer.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small It is really sad to take life this turn I mean it is very painful to realize that the departed will not return and that you are lonely now.  This sense of loneliness and strangeness that may lead to depression later on. I have experienced this terrible feeling that leads to fear of \textbf{nothing} or fear because I am alone without a partner, lover, friend or human being who has to be spoken with or ridiculed of his decisions,  Preparing it ..After the death of his grandmother at the beginning of the 72 I did not really feel something I do the duty to do so in solace that he often thought that it is not a consolation to him and I will return to the house and find them there sitting waiting for me to talk to her about what I did with all hardness and stability and I imagine her response to me.  ... and the loss of loss began to distract me very much and her imagination still haunts me wherever she goes every morning imagining that she will open the door of her room and go out and say we used to say in a comic way (sweet Chaswalnh of Roij) and what means breakfast this morning, my son.  I have failed so much to forget who I love I could not forget anyone before I was so lonely and depressed for five years I lost a lot of time I could not graduate from the university until this moment I changed my specialist very much without benefit Even after I got out of depression I feel like I'm out of death  Or I was born again I want to return to the pre-death of my grandmother I want to make up all the days that I missed without talking to her or squared for things stupidly useless. Sometimes I remember those little moments and the largest of the microscope and then ask myself why I did it I should not have done what I did.  Oh my dear grandmother, I am very sorry for all the bad happened in order for me or anyone else to apologize to every \textbf{elderly} person in the universe or rather to anyone who was subjected to abuse I am sorry that you suffered so how I wish you would accept my sincere apology and tell my dear grandmother that it was in heaven really accept my apologies and greetings and kisses  Warm.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Elderly, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s, Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!27}2/414 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.483 \\  \hline

I wasn't on the phone either and it was before the advent of mobiles.  By the end of the week I was feeling very low, and I was desperate for adult company.The second time, when I was 50 and my second husband and I had a trial separation.  However, I was working full time, but when I got home and locked up, closed the curtains and it was just me and the TV it was cold and lonely!  So I was a relatively young \textbf{woman} both times, so I really can't believe how these people survive.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small There's a big difference between people who have lost their long time mates and people who are living alone, in general.  There's lonely and being alone.  Too many people can't tell the difference.  They want someone to entertain them and/or they require other people to make them feel better.  People need to learn how to entertain themselves and proactively seek others out.  I'm not referring to the \textbf{elderly} in this video.  They come from a generation where people didn't plan (especially women) what to do when their spouse was gone.  They assumed their children would be there for them.  After all, that's what children are for, right? It's sad for them.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small IF THIS HELPS ANYONE: Join a family gym (preferably more than one) and go every other day, and switch up times/days.  You WILL meet people over time.  Approach people if you can (NOT young women working out, unless you're female, but almost anyone else) and just LISTEN to them.  Even if you're not good at approaching, you will be approached yourself at some point.  It can be so easy that you can end up with too many people that you will feel obligations to.  And this crosses ALL \textbf{age} groups, myself as a middle aged male knowing people in their early 20's all the way into their mid-80's (with the exception of the young women mentioned above).  I interact with the connections I've made on a very regular basis.FAMILY-type gyms...NOT the meat-market gyms (Gold's, etc). YMCA and JCC's and similar community centers.Most seniors always welcome interaction (and are so often awesome people to know) and almost all men of all ages are absolutely fine with it as well, and most women over 35 or so, and esp older women.  And these are often very decent connections that are solid and last a lifetime, AND do often go outside of the gym environment.I have family members who can attest to the same experience.I may make a video on it.P.S.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small It certainly is a sad statement on society . I can tell you tho it seems to be a cultural  problem . Other society's treat their \textbf{elderly} quite well from what I have seen . Example ! I live in Los Angeles and my grandmother died many years ago . When I go to visit her resting place I swear I am the only one in that section of the cemetery . Now you look at the Hispanic side of the cemetery since the demographics have changed in the San Fernando Valley since my grandmothers time there are families with chairs set up having picnics and that section is covered in flowers and where my grandmothers grave is at most times it is the only grave with any flowers . I know what you are thinking and I thought the same thing ! Most be more recent deaths on the Hispanic side ! I went to look myself one day and there were graves near as as \textbf{old} as my grandmothers with flowers on them . I guess I can conclude with this . I practice what I preach ! I lost my mother about ten years ago but almost everyday on the way home from work I would call her on my cell and talk to her  . Now that she is gone I am very happy that I did . All we need to do is treat others the way you would want to be treated when your day comes to be \textbf{elderly} and I believe that would help solve what in my opinion is a damn shame on us !\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Elderly, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}3/273 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.099 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small You are absolutely right ! It is a cultural problem. I live the Netherlands (forgive my bad English) and cultural differences in Europe are even bigger than in the USA. In our country people over 70 are treated as a burdan. It is quit normal that older people are send to retirement homes by their children. When they are very, very lucky their children visit them once a month. Mostly they will be forgotten. It is the same in Germany and Belgium. But in southern Europe older people lives among their familys untill they die. The most respectfull countries are the Baltic States (Latvia etc) and the countries in the East (Poland, Hungary etc). Those countries treasure their \textbf{elderly} because of their wisdom and experience. I don't know what is wrong with our culture.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small This is a comment for young people, meaning anybody under the \textbf{age} of 40 but more for those under the \textbf{age} of 20. When you become older or \textbf{elderly} your brain still is in a state of being 25. It is shocking for an \textbf{elderly} person to look in the mirror because they see a parent or grandparent. Yet,  their mind is as aware and awake as a 25 year \textbf{old}. For example, say you're 60 years \textbf{old} and you see a good-looking young person that makes your juices suddenly flow!  10 seconds later you realize ohmygod, I'm 40 years older than that person; what's the matter with me? The fact is, your brain is still 25 years \textbf{old}. That is something you cannot explain to young people. They think you're \textbf{old}. But it's your body that's \textbf{old}. Not your mind. If you younger people truly understood this they would not make remarks about older people to the degree that it has infected our society. Unpleasant people exist of every \textbf{age}. And idiots can be 81 years \textbf{old} or 18 years \textbf{old}.

I'll bring them clothes we no longer need, like pants/sweaters, as they can no longer go shopping.  If she needs stuff, like milk/paper towel, I'll bring it on my way.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I'm \textbf{Indian} and one thing I'm really proud of my culture is that there is no concept of children and parents living separately no matter how \textbf{old} or young one maybe (exceptions excluded). Family is family, from the day you are born till the day you are dead. I never really understood this pathetic idea of children not living with their parents and taking care of them when they're \textbf{old} and frail, just like the parents took care of their children when they are young and frail. Seriously I wanna ask the westerners: what's so important about "living separately"? I don't find this one thing civilized at all about the "civilized" world. Living with one's parents doesn't necessarily mean one has to be dependent on someone. Living together under one roof, have meals together, conversations, laughter, sorrows together is such a joy and kind of a need for humans considering we are social animals. So many things are good about the west, it is developed, has higher standard of living etc etc, but I find this one thing absolutely repulsive and disgusting about the west. I'm a 27 year \textbf{old} male living in a different city from my parents' for work. But sooner or later, one day me and my parents (and my future family) are gonna live together or at least in absolute proximity so that everyday we see each other, eat together etc. This is how it is meant to be. We are not jungle animals that we need to be "out in the wild" hunting for our food alone once we have grown up.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small In Ireland we have an organisation called Friends of the \textbf{Elderly}.  Everyone is assigned an \textbf{old} person to befriend.  Being a 'friend' means visiting them at least once a week and calling them on the phone at least twice a week.  After that it's up to yourself how much additional effort you want to put into the friendship.  Everyone I know does a lot more than the visit and the two phone calls.  We all become genuine friends with the \textbf{old} person we befriend.  We take them out on day trips, celebrate their birthdays, do a few tasks that need doing in their home.  Inter-generational friendships are the most enriching because we gain a different perspective on life and there is so much to learn from that.  Our organisation's motto is "Flowers before bread" meaning that feeding the soul is even more important than feeding the body.

For others that are active and can go out, then joining clubs, visiting museums, parks, and VOLUNTEERING in the community is key. The city I live in has tons of \textbf{elderly}(60-95) volunteers that do it to help the community, stay active and social. It's the \textbf{elderly} that can't get out of the house, do to disability, that have a bigger challenge with loneliness. Those are the ones that need to make connections, even if online or over the phone otherwise they don't ever speak to another human. Pets are also a huge source of comfort. Not just dogs and cats but smaller creatures like guniea \textbf{pigs}. Activities like doing puzzles, reading, painting and even caring for plants are all helpful in staving off loneliness. The right lamps(the kind used for seasonal affective disorder) helps keep the "blues" and mild depression away(They help with Serotonin levels in the brain) Especially in regions with less sunny days due to rain, overcast or snow.

They don't have to do anything just sit there and talk to the children or hold the babies and be a blessing. The issue is getting out not waiting for someone to come to them. If they cannot get out then someone would have to come get them from the organization they are involved in. I enjoy doing crafts with mentally challenged adults and children.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small More co-housing communities would help. If you own a house you have choices. You could find other adults who are in the same situation and build your own Co-housing Community. Co-Housing Communities mean that each person has their own small home \& outdoor space, (in some cases just a balcony) but there is also shared space for the community.   So it might be an estate with small houses \& little gardens and also a bigger house which provides a large kitchen and dining/social space for regular shared meals, plus some bedrooms for visitors and maybe a laundry or additional storage space. Outside there would be a shared vegetable garden and recreation area. Co-Housing Communities in cities are sometimes blocks of flats. They have a larger flat or centre with shared facilities and often a shared courtyard and /or roof garden.      Why dosent anyone talk about how the nature of the housing we build isolates people?

Is there no community centre close or a seniors centre. I suspect it's  more too, not having loved ones alive and having to rely on volunteers. I have lost friends and each one  takes a part if me but in reality it's just ling lost  memories and you must go on. My husband has been in care 20 years. I have seen many lovely people who end up in care  there because none of their friends  or close caring relatives are alive any longer.  Other family are distant or busy.  But you can rise above that. After all you have been through in life your going to allow loneliness to get you down. Cone on now... It's important to not get too isolated. Perhaps moving into a seniors apartment if they are not ready for assisted living. They seems both, very lovely and most certanly not candidates for care. They might find a community of friends  in an apartment. Sometimes we stay too long not wanting to give up our homes but life does need altering as we \textbf{age}. Less is more and less chores or  cleaning and yard work but also safety become priorities. . A simpler life surrounded by seniors  dealing with the same issues can be comforting. Their Dr or  Church might be helpful in finding a great place to \textbf{transition}. Not much point staying at home all the time. These dear people are a treasure and should still be enjoying life. I think there is a time when family must encourage them to alter their  living arrangements but also respecting their activity level and social preferences. Perhaps closer to a town or city's centre so they go for walks to the local shops and parks.  Of course sometimes family vultures may be waiting for their home. They should sell and enjoy the money. Find a nice \textbf{senior} apartment or the new thing is  some seniors are cruising because of  the costs and all meals and activities included it works out economical for them. Bith could go on a cruise together. Separate cabins but as travel company. Your lovely people get moving enjoying your life.  Being alone is a choice now....you know that.....It's time to get busy and make sime positive changes. As a young girl in High School wirking as a supervisor at a Kmart my Manage said to train my young staff to akways taje a moment to have a conversation with a \textbf{senior} at the checkouts. He said as your saying , they may be the only person they speak to all day. That lesson stayed with me all my life. Kindness Rules. But also these days there is no need to not be involved as active healthy seniors. Now, get  going. Even a school program might like having you help at events or help children learn to read even once a month or be a Grandparent to a family that has none. They have adopt a Grandparent program in Canada. They must where you are or start one. That would be such a gift for them. There is much we can all learn from you. Please seek out a healthy program to be involved with. Your precious lively people with so much to give...dont be alone. Do whatevrer is necessary to  find involvement. ❤\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Senior, Transition & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Sexual Identity - Transexuality & \cellcolor{green!27}4/573 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.698 \\  \hline

I trained the parents to manage my 2 remaining restaurants and pay them handsomely.   The remaining income, I spend  with the children.   We swim in rivers, we do gardening, I bought them animals for them to take care of, I fill up their fridge with lots of ice cream, chocolates, bread and whatever they ask me to buy.  From time to time we go shopping and drive them wherever they want to go.  I improve their house and partitioned it for every kid to have his/her comfortable and private room.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I'm glad there are tons of single people in the world. Those are the people who have the time and energy to volunteer or go and help others or be a friend or a good bother or sister or daughter. Allot of people who couple up live in their own universes and don't expand and then when one of them dies, they have no idea how to deal with being alone. Also sadly coupled people become so immersed in their lives, they selfishly abandon their own \textbf{old} parents or family in need or even lonely friends that reach out and just stay within the confines of that relationship or their  grown kids. And then they wonder later why their own kids neglected them when they become \textbf{old}. We have to teach others how we want to be treated by treating others with true love which is in action. And action sometimes is an inconvenience for people.

They use to.take care of parents, because they truly wanted to.out of love and concern,  Now its more that they feel, they have to do it, but aren't thrilled about it. I'm not saying, my children feel that way, but, most children do feel that way.  Or do us older people, think they do?  I never did. I took care of my mother for over 20 years, in our home. And enjoyed the time God gave me with her. I miss her terribly.. She passed away in 2012 at 93 yrs \textbf{old}. and I wouldn't have changed, a thing, or  my thoughts on caring for her. I wish I could do it all over again.  Probably if able, I'd like to live, in a small apt. Or assisted living, where I could be on my own, yet have,  someone to look in on me, once in awile.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I wholeheartedly agree with you on this one.  I was one that spent a lot of time with my grandparents, even when one wound up in a nursing home after the death of the other.  Our \textbf{elderly} are special and deserve to not be forgotten.  I can tell you right now that in my observation of the all the dear \textbf{elderly} people around in the big luxurious nursing home my grandfather was in is that a lot of them were alone all day with just their carers popping in (not many of them about either) and the company of other \textbf{elderly} people who were up for a chat.  Family though.... the majority of the people did not have family that regularly visited them... no way.  The ones that did well their families stood out as I thought what amazing people to care for their loved ones.  Even with my own family, not everyone visited and you want to know what their reason was?  Well he's in a retirement home being cared for, what more do you want?  Well well.... let's see.... COMPANY that's what they'd like.... your hard to find looking at the bottom of a barrel company that's what!  People seem to have it in their dense heads that \textbf{elderly} people are no longer social and should just disappear already so the inheritance gets dished out.  The attitude of most today sucks.... I know there are still quite a few caring people though so that gives me hope that we're not all going to wind up in the dismal state that a lot of our \textbf{elderly} currently are in.

But they can sometimes still be maintained at home quite well with increased caregiving services as required...an \textbf{elderly} person living at home can spend time at the local \textbf{Senior} Center if they want to enjoy the company of their contemporaries.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@VioletBlue Still though... it is  dangerous to generalize.   When I was a kid I got spanked every day...and I was a pretty good kid.

"If you ever have problems don't think you're going to move back home with some kids in tow."   Say what?  Eventually THEY moved away and basically abandoned me.  I had some medical issues which made it difficult to work... although I always did.  When I did get married and have a baby I told them I was coming to visit... to show them their first  grandchild... they knew I was  coming  but when I got there... with my young infant... after a long drive... the door was locked.  They had gone to the beach.   Baby and I sat in a hot car for hours until they finally returned.  No apologies.. didn't care. When they got \textbf{old} and senile guess who cared for them, shopped for them, got them to medical appointments?   They didn't deserve me... but I just did the right thing. Perhaps I pitied them.People can not always understand a family's dynamics... from  the outside looking in. It is easy to jump to wrong conclusions.  I was later diagnosed with ptsd.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I do not inflict loneliness on myself. Both these people are in mourning and so are many others, that's life, and death.  There are many, many church organizations both these people could attend, many clubs and activities for older people, most normal people have friends unless they are extremely unpleasant to be around and if these two people have \textbf{mental} health problems etc then there already are plenty of other organizations already being paid for by the over burdened tax paying working people.  I object to the attempt to get even more money from hard-working taxpayers to oblige whiners.  The thing that stands out about both these "victims" is how well dressed, housed and cared for they are.  Leave our money alone, stop using working people's tax money for people who have always known this would happen. It' always about screwing even more money out of people who work hard and redistributing it to those who should take responsibility for themselves.  This \textbf{old} couple have loads of good hearted people running all over the place catering to them.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small It is gut wrenching and the older I get (I'm staring down the barrel at 60) the more I'm cognizant of this issue.   I delivered 'Meals on wheels'  at various times and learned that hunger is a huge issue...but not just for food, but for companionship. I learned a lot from those clients who were willing to share even minute parts of their lives.    Most were 'grab the grub and shut the door' types.   But some were talkative.  Most had lost spouses and had grown grandchildren scattered around the city, state and country.  They were alone, but didn't know how to cope with it. They didn't know how to process the \textbf{mental} difference between being alone and being lonely.    Many didn't want to learn at \textbf{age} 85.I've also worked with nursing home and assisted living environments.   There was \textbf{nothing} sadder than seeing a patient dressed up and ready to spend Christmas with family, but no one ever showed up.  I finally spoke about it to an administrator once   She said she understood my sentiments but then shared something with me that sadly (based on the patients I'd come to know), made sense.    She'd been in the business of \textbf{elderly} care for 30 years.  In the beginning, she too, was  deeply phased by patientswith families that just didn't seem to care.    No visitors, no cards or children's drawings taped on the walls of their rooms.    Holidays were spent alone.    They 'celebrated' Christmases,  Thanksgivings and Easter's  with a TV that had limited channels, a holiday skeleton crew who didn't want to be there and a bland meal  or two.  With the passing of each year she was in the biz,  she learned in many cases, a neglected \textbf{senior}, had been a neglectful parent. She explained that paying for their parents' care was all the emotion some adult children could muster.   Karma.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small There is this lovely poem about growing \textbf{old}, and cannot just how it went right now, but it is something like this:  What do you see when you look at me? A lonely \textbf{old} person, crumbly and poor, or do you see that this \textbf{woman}/man was once a child, someone loved so much, did you see the person growing up and having hard times and things to learn? Do you see this \textbf{elderly} person raising children at their knees, and up at night and holding them to help them as they live  with love and protection, or do you just see and \textbf{old} person not doing anything just abiding time? Do you see the \textbf{woman} man with grandchildren who love them still and do you see them babysitting and taking god care while you have your own cares? Now what do you see when you look at me? Just someone that reminds you of \textbf{age} and death and you are scared, so now you never come around? Do you see the \textbf{old} person alone and in need? Do you see the person "waiting" and "waiting" just to hear " I love you?"  It goes on but it does go together much better than this, but it is on this idea to get one to think of how many can end up if no one cares. It i happening ALOT now more than EVER!Often a daughter in law or son in law may not want their spouse to bother with the parents as they just do not want to take time out of their life, and only for their own parents but not  "in laws" Sometimes they just do not care for them. BUT they were parents and they loved and love now. They have a heart and mind and much to share.. Do we SEE the TRUE person inside and that person living life in AL STAGES that the young person is doing now? BUT then they were LEFT ALONE to handle defeat when aged and weak and tired and hurting and maybe very sick and growing more feeble, and maybe even have problems with their minds? Does ANYONE CARE? Thank God for neighbors, if this does  happen and \textbf{elderly} are left alone,  and people  come to check on them. BUT they NEED FAMILY to protect them if they need to go to a nursing home or hospital to be sure they are getting the right care. To make sure they still  know they are loved. It is not enough to say " You know we love you, we are just too busy" Then we lay it all on the State or county to take car of them, and no one will care HOW it is done. No one knows how they cry for family when no one comes. Often people just FORGET that they too are growing older each day. That how will they feel in that  same position they are putting this older person into, if it happens to them later in life? I worked as nurse for many years and have seen this happen first hand. It certainly does happen and is happening more. The \textbf{elderly} used to be so respected and family would come once a week to visit, and maybe have dinner. As long as it was possible for them to handle it, people would try, for those who could anyway, at least they would make sure some made it, even if each person brings a dish to pass, which helps the older person  so much if all jump up and do their part as it is family. . Then all sit and pray and eat together. That time would LINGER IN THEIR MINDS WHEN LONELY OR JUST ALONE. THEY DO NOT FORGET THOSE MOMENTS THAT YOU SPEND WITH THEM AT THE END TIMES OF THE YEARS. NO ONE KNOWS THE NUMBER OF DAYS ANYONE WILL HAVE. WE SAY PEOPLE LIVE LONGER AND SOMETIMES THEY DO AND YET I HAVE STILL SEEN PEOPLE DIE AT YOUNGER AGES, OF DISEASE AND YES, WE MAY HAVE OUR PARENTS ONE DAY AND NOT THE NEXT. WE MUST ALWAYS THINK TWICE ABOUT THIS. SEE THAT YOUNG \textbf{WOMAN} OR MAN AND HOW THEY WERE AS PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS AND NO ONE IS PERFECT, AND WE MAKE MISTAKES, BUT THEY DESERVE LOVE AND SOME COMPANY NOW  AND THEN.

I often see people who are troubled by the world (\textbf{nothing} to be ashamed of) to "come look at my horses...it will cheer you up!"  You are welcome there with us. Read the few comments that are there and you will see that I have great relationships with the ladies who have blessed me with their friendship. Please come on over! Just click on the gray circle by my name and it will direct you to my channel. I don't ask people for money and I don't care about how many Subscribers I have. I kind of like being a little secret, that way, we can really have good conversations and the whole world doesn't know about it. Come on over and see what I mean. All of you are welcome to check my video and DECERN if you like it or not. If you don't like it, you can advise Carol to not subscribe. I want everyone to know I am a nice person and Carol would have a nice place to come for friendship. Jesus said..."As I have loved you, love one another" and he also said "Love thy Neighbor"  and "Do unto others as I have done unto you" and "to judge them off their fruits" so, come on over...anyone who sees this who likes my idea is welcome to come see!

I did not throw my husband away - he died many years ago and I then faced life with courage and enjoy the so called challenges.  There is a whole system out here that caters to older people and if one is normal and healthy it's great.  We do not need any more tax payer's money taken for unnecessary public servants to get cushy jobs pretending to "Look after lonely people".  It has to stop.

They invite you to engagements but really hope you don't take them up or show!! I been alone since almost birth my mother died when I was 8 months \textbf{old} my father was around till I was 8 then seemed to loose affection he found a women with a daughter and pretty much pushed me to the side I managed on my own because I was young strong outgoing and yes had good looks, I'd only see my father when he wanted to take out his anger or frustrations I made a great punching bag and verbal abuse toy till I became a teen and put my hands up and said NO MORE!! He later showed up as I was in my mid 20's doing well and made me feel as I owed him the world and I complied as a good son but he started his verbal comments and caused a problem with my relationships!! Although we lived and worked in the same trade together we never were close I believe only memories of good times before I was 9 and convenience and both the fear of loneliness kept us together but at a distance this would seem strange to people with a family and who have love in their lives they can't understand this concept but it works for those who fear being alone or have been abused!! At 41 I became injured at work causing me to end my trade also at the same time my father now retired had just developed Lung Cancer the man who once pushed me to the side as a child who also was an only child and no one to care for him looked to me and I as a good son who would never do what he did to me abandon stood up and for 2 years cared for him alone he would not let anyone else but me care for him as I kept for 2 years under such difficultness and abusive words from him never stopped I cared for him to the end I was 165 lbs. at the start and went down to 125 lbs. at the day of his death I had him as he wished to die at home holding his hand till his final breath all alone in the middle of the night waiting till morning to call the Mortician the only thing alive with me is a little puppy who I truly love then as today and the only love true love unconditional love I ever had!! Please anyone out there never harm an animal they can be the only love we ever have a mans truly best friend!! Immediately after I had a sever nervous breakdown at just 43 still a good looking man for 5 years I suffered and self-cared myself back with the help of only a little dog now in my late 40's from medication I have gained weight but still have looks but older also back always in pain and now 56 I haven't celebrated a birthday in over 10 years its just another day I mark of some times even forgetting the day if I am busy completely!! I am still with my dog he is now \textbf{ageing} himself I fear the moment he leaves me he has been my only source of life and love ever!! I know I will never see 70 or even 65 which gives me only a 9 year window and I don't know if my little friend leaves how much longer I or anyone in my position as the years have now taken a toll on me my mind my feelings and life itself I am very independent and set in my ways I have no one!!! Days can be long lonely but for my pup!! After I may be forced to do the only thing that's right and leave myself because going on may be more difficult than staying!! Oh I had some Joy in life I even loved once as they say better to of know love once then never!! But time has caught up with me and I believe I won't be able to move on further!! Those who don't know this life can not understand I honestly can say if things were different I could have been a Great and Loving Father and or Husband or both but for some this never happens!! So I hope where ever I end up in  another life or in Gods world I can find the Love one wishes and not worry about Loneliness!!

Technically she really isn't my blood relative, her husband was my father's life long friend. Every holiday I have invited them to spend with my family has been declined, they didn't want to be around all of the noise etc. I live an hour away from her but I travel at least once a week to go \& visit with her \& take care of her laundry \& bring her treats. In the last few years she has exhibited signs of dementia \& was recently placed in an assisted care facility. I cannot take care of her on a full time basis. She refuses to take her meds, practice basic hygiene and cannot will not take care of her home or cook for herself and she refused to let anyone help as well. The home that she is in takes very good care of her, the staff love her (even when she is being bitchy and unbearable!) and for the most part she is happy.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small IgnacioAgramonte Yes, u are right. But it is very sad that so many do not care until THEY are \textbf{old} and sick and it happens to them. Just so, so sad. So many are so selfish.  Our culture needs to address this and change how the sick and \textbf{elderly} are treated. And a good start would be to start paying the CNA's a decent wage. They are caring for our \textbf{elderly} and changing their diapers etc... And their job is very difficult and should be paid well. It is very important what they do! The problem is that our cultures attitude towards the sick and \textbf{elderly} is not right and it is a systemic issue in the  family, culture and government. Most children see their parents not caring for the grandparents as they should be. And then it happens to them and their children aren't around. Which should not be a shock to them. But many times, even when the parents did good, most children still aren't there for them. There is a lot of abuse that goes on and that should be penalized and punished very harshly! Just as abuse towards animals should be punished much more severely! We should be in the streets trying to make changes in our society. But so many do not care about what happens to others, UNTIL it happens to them. And this is a root cause of so much evil. There is a severe lack of empathy and compassion.  I wish Jesus would come back and finally end all the suffering!!! Because it looks like society is going to continue to get even more selfish and only care more for themselves and not care about others.

One NEVER knows HOW the parents grew up and learned. Or what Genes lurk., So if we do not understand it, we cannot judge it properly. BUT we do have EVERY right to stay away under those circumstances and not put their own children through it, and that is understandable if true.  Making sure the parent has learned and now knows and is forgiven ,can help them forgive themselves, as they may 'now' know? IF NOT< than you have every reason to walk on.

If a person believes in Jesus and will accept that they need him as their Saviour things can vastly change ! ,  For example John chapter  14 verrses.  23 to 25  states what Jesus said :. " if any many love s me he will keep my Word, and my Father will LOVE him and we will come to him and  MAKE. OUR  HOME. WITH  HIM.".   Isn't that a wonderful thought  ?   Unfortunately,  these people do not know Jesus, and have not received the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, which is a personal gift when we repent of going our own way, and it would appear  that lonely \textbf{old} people  do not  HAVE  a knowledge of God , .  Having faith, and the knowledge of what Jesus has done for us and the joy of his prescence would give such \textbf{old} people hope and a renewed meaning to life ! .    Naturally, there are circumstances and events we miss, for example in my case, I miss my beautiful Bosendorfer grand piano, on which I played Beethoven and all the great !

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Christopher Tacitus loneliness is more pervasive than most people know.  It happens at any \textbf{age}.

And here you are, trying to sweep everything under the carpet as quickly as possible.

I know the feeling of being lonely and in islam loneliness is forbidding. You have to be around your brothers and sisters ( in the faith and biological ones). Islam teaches unity. So just take my advice and see the difference. I am sure all of you have tried different books, ways of being around others but try \textbf{Quran} this time.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small +songster117 Honey, these days joining a church isn't going to end loneliness. It's a sad truth, but now-a-days most churches do not cater to the \textbf{elderly}/widows/divorced. They don't go visit them and care little about them -the only concern is if they pay their tithes. So sad. I use to visit \textbf{elderly} and they loved my company b/c I keep them laughing about something. But, over the years, I've found myself just trying "to live" and pay bills and haven't had extra time to go out and spend time with the \textbf{elderly}. Seeing this vid makes me sad, b/c I feel that I'm not able to do my part in helping the \textbf{elderly}.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Hi Sophie, I see it's been two years ago that you made your comment. I hope you've been well. I'm 57, a Veteran of the Marine Corps and today is Veterans Day. I stayed in today, and didn't get out due to lack of enough fuel in my vehicle. It was your mention of " ... if there is no call to action or link...". The whole matter is complicated. Many, if not most, will solely blame a persons \textbf{mental} health ( Anixety, Depression, etc. ) and dismiss any needed personnel action, and "Yes", sometime those Medical Issues are part of the problem. However, due to the many variations of why a person is lonely it is nearly impossible to address them all. I, for one, have Medically Diagnosed,  Anxiety, Depression, and the stinker - Bipolar.  I live alone and roughly 90 of my interaction with people is on Social Media, of one sort or the other. You can't " help the world " Sophia, however if you but take just one person into your life, who you judge to be lonely, you will have done a world of good.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Mental & \cellcolor{green!5}Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}1/190 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.526 \\  \hline
