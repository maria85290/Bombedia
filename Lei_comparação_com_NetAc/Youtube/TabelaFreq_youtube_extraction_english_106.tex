  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I have been wondering about this for a while, and have broken down many of the scents. Besides \textbf{old}-people smell, the other scents that I associate with \textbf{old} people are \textbf{witch} hazel water, florida water, cabbage, mothballs, and pipe tobacco.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small At \textbf{age} 71 I have begun wondering if I don't sometimes notice an odd smell emanating from my body.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I don't remember my grandparents having a \textbf{weird} smell. I have smelled some older people that had a \textbf{weird} medicinal smell though.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small We \textbf{old} people have a secret cologne called 'Bengay and Pee'.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Getting \textbf{old} sucks. I hurt all the time. I have thick ass hair growing out of my ears.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Amazingly though, my 100 ear \textbf{old} mother is at a care facility in western Canada where there is no "\textbf{old} people smell" at all. The cleaning staff has been able to suppress it completely. They traced a good part of it to urine leakage. By using disposable absorbent adult underpants on those residents with leakage issues, they have wiped out a large part of the issue. Otherwise it is just a constant campaign for cleanliness. I have been visiting her there for ears and am still surprised b the odor free atmosphere there. As well, at \textbf{age} 67 myself, I was in the seniors ward at a hospital here in western Canada for 2 1/2 weeks and again, there was no particular odor in the place. Not even a "hospital" smell. My point is that some people, somewhere have researched this and figured out how to have olf people be odor free.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}3/152 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.974 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Old materials, including (better than today's) furniture, definitely factor into the smell of a house lived in by one person or couple for decades. If I had the money, I would want to have fabrics and upholstery, particularly mohair, that would boost the "\textbf{old}" effect, not for That reason, but because I like the feel of those materials.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}2/58 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.448 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The intensity of the odor could have factors in general health and socioeconomics. If the \textbf{elderly} person is in very poor health and impoverished, they might have a difficult time with bathing, changing their clothes regularly, and the house chores. A person with better health or more resources might have an easier time keeping up with their hygiene and housecleaning, either by themselves or by getting help.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Elderly & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}1/67 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.493 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The lower testosterone in an aging man will.make him smell more ... feminine.Also, medications taken by the \textbf{elderly} will make them smell ... different.Factor in drier skin to the equation and you have -- the 'old people smell.'\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Elderly & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}1/40 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.5 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Bad smell comes from poor hygiene and from not getting fresh clean clothes everyday. The cause may be dementia, poverty (fear of not being able to pay water and electricity or gas bills) or even poor health, as it can be extremely painful for someone suffering from severe arthrosis to have a shower or take care of the laundry. \textbf{Elderly} people need someone to look after them. As simple as that.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Elderly & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}1/71 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.408 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I've noticed two factors.1.  Older people have diminished sense of smell and so they don't realize they stink.  Add in that many stop bathing daily because "I just sat in the house all day," and they don't realize how bad their BO has become.  It's \textbf{common} for ordinary people to not notice their own BO after several days not bathing.2.  Health issues can cause stenches.  Naturally occurring medical phenomena.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Common & \cellcolor{green!5}Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}1/71 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.408 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small old people smell like the anachronistic products they've always used and you never have. \textbf{old} \textbf{age} homes smell like ointment and doo doo, but that's not your grandparents fault. i miss the smell of my grandmas house, all the best foods ive ever eaten and vintage books and wood... at least i still have her cook books.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}3/57 & \cellcolor{green!5}5.263 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small An 80 year \textbf{old} guy works two doors down from me - in six years that I've known him he hasn't used deodorant even once.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I can smell who a person is by their scent. It ruins the prank for people trying to sneak up behind me unless they are upwind from me. I will concur that men past puberty stink and badly, although it does help to take a shower or two a day. One reason why older men might smell more like women is that everyone's hormones go down as they get older but \textbf{fat} cells actually produce a small amount of estrogens and so that smell tends to predominate in everyone who is a bit older.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Fat & \cellcolor{green!27}Physical Identity - Physical Features & \cellcolor{green!27}1/94 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.064 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small God,  I'm 65 , and I don't want to smell \textbf{old} .  Though I have no \textbf{old} books, clothes or any other \textbf{old} things hanging around.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I think its a combination of sluggish immune systems leading to yeast or fungal overgrowth/chronic mild infections that cause strong smells but not noticeable symptoms, plus dental hygiene issues, plus the fact that most older folks I know are sort of.... oily... feeling - the ones with the strongest smell and I think that oiliness sort of ends up all over interior surfaces and carries the smell with it, plus easily irritated skin leading to using less soap/a gentler brand of laundry detergent and it doesn't wash away the \textbf{old} people smell effectively, their smell seeps into any soft surface (like it does for anyone, you know when you walk into someones house the first time unless they are the air freshener family there is a definite smell not a bad one per say just a "this house is unfamiliar" smell), plus cleaning isn't as easy when you're older (I'm not saying \textbf{old} people are gross, but they do miss things due to eyesight or not being able to climb a step stool etc), plus your sense of smell declines with \textbf{age}, plus the style of cooking that older people prefer seems to add to that smell. I'm not saying any of this is bad or gross btw, I basically think it's body chemistry slowly changing and breaking down and lifestyle. :3 tl;dr - They have a distinct smell because of multiple lifestyle and body changes that promote a stronger personal scent.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}3/242 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.24 \\  \hline

You let people pass in front of you, especially if they smell bad so they sit in the middle and you have the window for your oxygen.Only sometimes you forgot and you breath with your head turned in their direction.Also that's basically tha same smell as \textbf{old} people, that's the smell of having what you are wearing impregnated with shit particles.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}1/117 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.855 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I'm still looking for a good explanation. They do smell. That it's from the ancient items in their home may be on to something, because their homes smell peculiar too.
