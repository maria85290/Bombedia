  \cellcolor{green!5}\small It's silly to act like \textbf{age} isn't a factor in almost all professions. There are things the average 30 year \textbf{old} can do that the average 60 year \textbf{old} can't and vice versa. If you're an actress then of of course you're gonna get less jobs as you get older because female roles are different to male roles and (I hate to break it to you) beauty is a big part of a lot of female roles.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}3/77 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.896 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I'm am currently dealing with this.  I work as a freelancer/contract basis and have more than double the experience as most in my business but have a really hard time getting work now.  I'm only 48.  But to them, I'm an \textbf{old} man.  The people doing the hiring are young and they only hire the young.  My work and resume speak just don't seem to matter anymore.  So now I'm trying to find work outside my industry, just a normal job, to help pay the bills. But even then, I get laughed at a lot.  They're like what are you doing here?  They don't take me seriously.  It's SO frustrating!!!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}1/110 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.909 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small LanceHenryPT it's not right but you know what, one day they will become your \textbf{age} and see what it's like then.  I hate to say that but that's the truth.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I think she doesn't want to be controversial or confrontational. Let's be honest she's use to fox viewers where she can say whatever she wants and everyone agree with her the view audience are mostly liberal or lean left so are her cast mates .She's walking on \textbf{thin} ice but she need to stop playing nice and assert her view whether audience agree with it.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small geva tinker What point? The point that you hate yourself for getting \textbf{old}, and that you put makeup on to look younger, and more attractive. While simultaneously running around telling people to that it's not to bias towards older people? Any rational person would just accept the fact that we're all getting \textbf{old}, and accept that fact as part of life. Women's shallow nature is their own worst enemy, and is the reason for the hypocrisy in this video.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}2/79 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.532 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small How do women get wiser than men? Genuine question, i know shes speaking in general terms.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Yea, I don't know what \textbf{age} was talking about there.   Both gain life experience and wisdom.   And what does she mean by 'wise?'    Straight intellect?   Taking care of your physical and \textbf{mental} health?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Even allowing for "\textbf{black} don't crack," Sunny looks exceptional.  Is it all natural, I wonder, or have been some interventions?  Even if so, well done!  I would not have put her at 50, and I can be coldly cynical and blithely unforgiving when it comes to guessing \textbf{age}. Like, Trump looks like 87 to me and certain \textbf{black} celebrities also look way older to me than they say.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Black & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!5}3/68 & \cellcolor{green!5}4.412 \\  \hline

\textbf{\Large Result analysis:}

\begin{itemize}\item Taking into account the words that were detected, we can reach the conclusion these comments are associated with : : Age - General;Age - Over 65s;Ethnicity - General;Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments;Ethnicity - Black;Physical Identity - Physical Features;Gender - General;Age - Youngsters;%.

\item The percentage of hate speech related words is 1.9646.

\item Considering that the variable \textbf{Age - General} has the most occurences in the post, we can interpret that this is the predominant hate speech.

\item Overall there were 63/184 occurences of hate speech related comments.\end{itemize}\end{document}
