  \cellcolor{green!5}\small This is horrible; I hope they are okay. And a human's actions are not representative non-biological \textbf{race}. Though \textbf{racism} is related to the cycle of violence. This is a catastrophe that has been going on for hundreds (thousands?) of years. United States of America and many places have a serious catastrophe of racial abuse to benefit certain people; since hundreds of years ago-to benefit rich, 'white' people economically and socially and do that by oppressing other people; since then the rich people have bought media outlets, and do a lot of propaganda, only fund certain studies in medicine, give money to produce certain tv shows and movies etc. to advance their agenda by spreading false and stereotypical narratives to try to convince the majority (middle class and poorer people of all skin tones) to devalue other people; some people have become convinced of this and that's called internalized \textbf{racism}; some people who have internalized this propaganda do direct name calling; in some places people pretend to not see skin color but also don't believe any reparations need to be made to undo the oppression, though there's been affirmative action for white people for hundreds of years. Look up talks by Cornel West, Robin DiAngelo, Malcom X, DeRay McKesson. Look online at \textbf{Jim C\textbf{row}} Museum of \textbf{Racist} Memorabilia, and many others. It's amazing people who were oppressed fought for their rights as much as they could and passed the work to the next generation before they died. To counter these types of abuse and propaganda there have been and continue to be social anti-\textbf{racism}, anti-transphobia, anti-patriarchy, workers rights etc. movements. Be part of movements and talk to people and organize to do the work, and get comfortable being uncomfortable to fight for equal rights for everyone.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Crow, Jim Crow, Race, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}5/295 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.695 \\  \hline

So many times have I gone to an \textbf{Indian} business to purchase something with cash and they always claim to not have change. They're always haggling for everything down to the penny. At this point I totally avoid them. Don't even get me started on the hygiene. I don't believe in violence or hate crimes against Indians because that's flat out wrong. However I do think it's time we start revoking a lot of their work visas. People are getting sick of dealing with them.
