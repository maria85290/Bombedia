  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I've commented on this video before, but I would just love to restate... I do like older men. I'm 24 and all I want is an older man. I don't know why, but ever since I was a child I knew I liked people that were older than me. I just cannot stand people my \textbf{age}. It's like, I feel like they're children and they haven't grown up or something and any experience I've ever had with someone my \textbf{age} just didnt turn out right or messed me up somehow. If I could find someone who is like 40+yo and had my same interests and loved me the way I should be, then where's the negative?? Everyone in my family knows I like older people so it wouldn't be a suprise. And it's not \textbf{weird} either. I'm not in it for money or whatever other people think a 24 year \textbf{old} girl would want from a 50 year \textbf{old} man... I just want a normal relationship!... with someone older. Is it \textbf{weird}??? Did this comment get too personal?? Hahahaha oh well. Hit me up, y'all! (Also, no supposed "daddy issues" either. I have a great dad who is alive and well and hard working.

And then your actual love is tested -- what may have once felt 'hot and experimental' is now...OK this person is clearly aging and they look their \textbf{age}.¬†You, the younger party, could meanwhile be w totally \textbf{age}-appropriate people who don't look like this.And who won't be as complicated to be with (beyond looks -- plain life planning), either.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small PLEASE READ!!!! ONLY CHILD OF FATHER 25 YRS. OLDER THAN MY MOTHER.Please do your due diligence before making a firm decision on proceeation. Growing up a child born to parents with a large \textbf{age} gap alienates the child. Not only will the child notice that other parents of kids his/her \textbf{age} do not have an \textbf{age} gap, but the child will be incessantly questioned, ridiculed, bullied etc. by peers.Mindy, have you thoroughly brainstormed possible future outcomes?!? Most of my elementary school years were spent in and out of hospitals because of my father's advancing \textbf{age}. (Severe neck injury, pancreatic cancer, and others) Yoy will be young, your child will be younger, Larry will continue to \textbf{age}, lose energy, vitality, and capabilities. My mother ended up parenting amd taking care of her aging husband. \textbf{Sex} became an issue between my parents. My father was not able physically to satisfy my mother sexually decades before she was done enjoying and having \textbf{sexual} gratification in her life.I hope you can make inferences about how all of this will impact the child's quality of life in addition to the afore mentioned.I believe if the two of you are happy, be happy. Think strongly before adding an addition to your happiness.My father moved into a motel before I started high school where he worked the front desk to pay his rent. My mother, in vindictiveness, deprived him of his pension and social security income even though she worked a well paying job. She spent the money selfishly on herself and only herself.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small My fianc√© is 34 and I'm 23 (24 in January). We have been together since I was 20. We didn't discuss our \textbf{age} for quite a long time because it never felt relevant. What is relevant is our love for eachother. Despite my much younger \textbf{age}, it's no vexation for either of us. Our interests and affections align. I don't believe we've ever had a true argument. There's no mendacity, no resentment. He saved my life. Initially I felt scolded by my family for dating an older man, but I've never considered 30-40 \textbf{old} and do tend to be attracted to men that \textbf{age}. I feel exclusively turned on by my fianc√©, I won't be all lascivious here or anything-but I love him, I would do absolutely anything for him. If it's the right person, the \textbf{age} shouldn't be an issue BETWEEN the two relevant individuals. It's not perverted, I'm sexually mature despite having a 'baby face' and voice-Our first interactions were text based so he truly felt initial attraction just via communicating so well. I would never want another man but him. If you feel a genuine connection with an older man/younger \textbf{woman}, pursuing it shouldn't be considered it any kind of taboo. Obviously everybody involved should be at an \textbf{age} where they can mentally and legally consent. I just believe some of the scathing glances we've gotten in public are much more vulgar than anything about our life together. Sorry for bloviating and all-I wanted to share my experience! I do love him so dearly! And I admire him.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Old, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}7/261 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.682 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Honestly, this guy isn't doesn't look bad.  He's older, but I can see how his personality, warmth and charm could have won her over.  Many men her \textbf{age} can be real jerks.  If they are happy, that's all matters.  Time will tell, though.  A \textbf{woman}, many times doesn't hit her stride until her mid-30's, early 40's - where will he be then?  They look cute now, but the consequences will play out 10 - 15 years from now - especially if they have children.  About 3 years ago, my ex married a \textbf{woman} about 26 - when he was 65.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I'm biblical times this was accepted.  I think a reverse scenario is the Book of Ruth.  Which teenagers used to get married, where it  was normal.Where he's older, but deal.  He probably is more interested in her than hanging out with the boys.  She don't have to compete for his attention between her or a football game.Again, they're probably very likely to have a very intimate relationship where they will have quality conversations and interactions.Where he's apt to live a healthier life having a lady that's younger and more positive.  If he were to cash in early, pardon the expression, she can be content of having had a quality relationship.Where who can judge them?  Look at so many having children and become single parent homes which is hard.  Or look at all the people who get married, then they get divorced, only to get remarried again.  Still having troubles associated with younger guys.  Also, look at the younger guys that run around on their wives, where him being older probably isn't likely to happen.Where I would guess he's more apt to take time and interest in things she's interested in.  Of course all of these things are still individual things, it still is more likely to be a quality relationship.As far as what other people think.  Well they don't have to live your life.  Or the hardships by sticking to societal norms that are man made and conditional to this society.But Joseph was supposedly much older than Mary in the Bible.Which there's many women that live with the frustrations of younger guys, where they want their toys and hang out with the boys.  Not to mention that give more attention to ball games than they do their wife.Which they clicked right from the start.  Where they could actually relate to each other which is really good for a relationship.  He's probably isn't as selfish as a younger guy.He may not have money, but odds are, he's there to be with her.Then she doesn't have to contend with immaturity.Look at Donald Trump.  His wife is younger too.  Which whether she likes his money, him or both, well that's between them.Again a person themselves have to live with the person they want as a companion!  Mom and Daddy, society don't have to live with the consequences of following ideas of society but that person does.  When they go to sleep at night, it's just them two.  Where it's important those two are content with each other.  Which applies to anyone.Again, at different times, this type of arrangement wasn't uncommon.  Society changes according to economics and everything else.  Which isn't always conducive to quality relationships. Look at all the divorce and remarriage, look at those that are trapped in a marriage they're prefer not to be in which are many.  Look at all the spousal abuse or neglect which is widespread and these people think they're qualified to weigh in on what they think is right or good. Not to mention all those that engage in extramarital affairs.  Where I'm not judging them, but questioning them judging others who really are happy together.Then there's many other things to consider that I haven't remarked on.Just think about it.They is a formula others came up with, that's half your \textbf{age} plus 7 will give you an \textbf{age} range.  Where there's cultural similiarities and other things.  Yet, it's not absolute.  As there's some who still value things of other times.Again, after a certain \textbf{age}, \textbf{age} really isn't a factor.  Otherwords, a 16 year \textbf{old} hasn't had life experience to know what's happening in the world, compared to a 40 year \textbf{old}.  Where I know of a 16 year \textbf{old} that ran off with a 40 something man.  But, by 25, one is generally settled and is aware of enough that they can discuss ideas the same as older people.Which like I've known any number of people that prefer to hang around older people just as friends.  Where they already outgrown all the foolishness of youth and like a decent calm conversation.Which as this couple, they can probably have quality conversations.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Nothing wrong with \textbf{age} gaps, love is love; but there is however, something selfish in bringing a child into a situation which will most definitely have a negative life changing impact in their childhood. It's not to say it's right or wrong, but it is selfish. If she is 30, he is 60. When that child turns 10, he will be 70. That's not only stressful to the child, it can also shorten his life expectancy because he will probably opt to do things his body simply struggles to do. Where would they be financially? When my grandfather was in his 60's, all within a 5 year time frame he hurt his back so badly he could no longer work. Disability would not take effect for at least 2 years. His back surgery was incredibly expensive. A year later his hip went out. Hip replaced. Then his knee replaced. Then his back again because the surgery didn't fix it. Not even 70 years \textbf{old} yet, he has out of pocketed hundreds of thousands and that's with disability now, and insurance then. How are you going to choose that priority? Is it fair either way? College savings or hip? A house to live in or sold for money? The child's soccer gear or heart meds? I see \textbf{nothing} wrong with relationships to be as they wish to be, but selfishness is about the child, not the parents. It's instinctive to want a baby for most women. But at what cost? People die young all the time, children grow up with single parents, but statistically the odds are against their future. It sucks. It really does. But it's true. If you come from broken homes you probably hung around other broken homes. What did you see? Where are most of the peers today? Jail? Drugs? Commitment issues? Deadbeat parents? Pregnancy happens accidentally too and that is of course worse odds where as in this case, the people are loving and a home is made. And I realize you can't predict the future. But they need to ready to bare consequences when life plays out. I wish them the best but I think adopting an older child would've been the best choice\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Nothing, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}4/369 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.084 \\  \hline

You make a decision about what matters most to you. Breeding or being with someone who loves you as more than a mere baby manufacturing incubator object. Women's priorities and values differ ie how they see the real purpose of womanhood marriage, Men etc. For most it is breed, breed, breed.. Unless they are impregnated they feel worthless as women. A few women are less animalistic or biologically driven.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small People below 24 are just finishing developing into adults. The brain development is not done at 18. That's why you will always notice a certain immaturity in people below that \textbf{age} however well experienced in life they may be. I think this factors into when someone is considered a child. Having seen this pattern over and over again throughout my life, I find it very creepy when a middle aged person is attracted to what is practically a child. They just do not have the life experience that the 45 yo has and it's an inherently unbalanced power dynamic preying on the vulnerability that the younger party brings in. It's a lot less creepy when it's someone over 25 hitting on like a 50 year \textbf{old}. By that \textbf{age} you have had the chance to meet lots of people and learn more.

Yet she may be content having already had a relationship.Here again, who can critize?  So many get married, then get divorced.  Worse, get married, have children, then divorce.Where I know we're not living in biblical times, but consider reality!  Where he's older and probably easier to talk with and have his attention. Again, him being older he's less likely to anger easily.Where again, I know of a couple of other scenarios where the \textbf{woman} actually enjoys having a husband twice her \textbf{age}.So many worry about social norms that were created by man, where it hasn't always been this way.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Why i see that people like their relationship but hate prophet Muhammad that married aisha not for \textbf{sex}. This couple clearly wants to get child. But prophet Muhammad does not married aisha for \textbf{sex}, he married aisha because aisha father request it. And he married aisya because aisya have strong memory to remember holy book so Muhammad married her to teach her holybook and will not get slandering by other people. In ancient times it is normal to married much younger people. In all countries, ancient people married a kid is Normal acts. Prophet Muhammad wasn't a pedophile,because aisha didn't get pregnant at her lifetime. And there's no condom in ancient times. If Muhammad was a pedophile,aisha will surely get pregnant. Muhammad is a good example for those people who married a younger \textbf{age},Muhammad also married \textbf{old} widow after married aisha because to help the widowed in terms of financial. Would \textbf{old} people still married \textbf{old} widow if they gets young girls?absolutely not. But prophet Muhammad married them because want to share wealth and knowledge with them. If Muhammad wants to married because of \textbf{sex},he surely have kids from other than first wife but he didn't had it at all. \textbf{Zero} kids from after the first wife. All kids are from khadijah first wife and khadijah much older than him. Muhammad even accept to married \textbf{old} khadijah but \textbf{nobody} look on Muhammad side than he also young and married \textbf{old} people as first marriage, it proves that at that time married a younger \textbf{age} wasn't a big problem.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small My husband and I are 18 years apart. I met him at 36. My husband has salt and pepper hair and I still look like I'm in my late 20's. So I can really relate to this couple. To be fair my hubby's had white hair since his 30's and I always have looked on average 10-15 years younger than my actual \textbf{age}. So the gap  looks more exaggerated than it actually is. People think we're 30-35 years apart. There's just no getting around that visually we don't look like a pair. But I love him dearly, and it was love at first sight. Older women give us dirty looks all the time. We get rude comments from people. It's hard being accepted as a couple. It's \textbf{age} discrimination of sorts. I know I will never experience the type of fear or shame that mixed \textbf{race} couples or \textbf{L\textbf{G\textbf{BT}}} community has, but I can relate. It's a choice to be with someone that society says you shouldn't be with. It's shooting for the ideal love relationship with someone who sees me for me and not what they want to pretend to see. We support and grow from being in each other's presence. Love is love is love. You can't put a box around it. The fact they met when she was so young, feels like there is a bit of worry but I just saw on another video she was 20 when they met. That means they both were adults. I don't see any \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} flags here that make me think one or the other is taking advantage. I see two consulting adults who happen to love each very much.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I was married to a man 32 years older than me. I met him at \textbf{age} 18 in 1982. He was 50 at the time. We lived together for 7 years then married. He died 4 years ago (on March 8, 2015) at the \textbf{age} of 83. We had 33 wonderful years together! Don't let what ANYONE else thinks keep you from missing what could be the best thing in your life. My husband had 3 grown kids and had also had a vasectomy. Rather than put him through a reversal, because it had been so long since he had it done, we simply used a surrogate father. I believe a man still makes sperm even if he has had a vasectomy. A fertility doctor can extract it and you can have artificial insemination. If I had known about that at the time...Anyway, I had 3 beautiful daughters. He loved them beyond everything. I am a 54 year \textbf{old} widow now but I wouldn't trade a single year I spent with my beloved. I fully intend to remarry but, at my \textbf{age} now, it will probably be someone close to my own \textbf{age} or younger.  If your man is in good shape, help keep him that way by exercising and eating healthy. My husband was a physician and was so busy taking care of other people that he didn't spend enough time on his own health. I knew he had diabetes but I didn't realize how fast things can get out of control. Ignore people who get on here and make negative comments.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small That's not really young girl + \textbf{old} man.  30+ is already way past being "young" in the sense these ppl are trying to say.  Well, particularly in Western society, a young \textbf{woman} (teens, early 20s) should be given an opportunity to "experience life" or "train for the future" to know what she wants before committing to major life stage like marriage.  Unlike other countries, where it's more \textbf{common} for young (i.e. fertile) women to just go for a rich man (often it means he's much older) because their role is primarily kids and home making while the man's duty encompassing money matters. Ramble tangent...I personally believe it's because of capitalist society has shifted a lot of value from "family" to "profit". So women are expected to also train and earn money to make and buy more stuff we don't really need...but line the pockets of even richer ppl (mostly men) by virtue of advertising.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Common, Old, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Gender - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}3/154 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.948 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small OK but there's many people out there who are wondering this. So I will bring it up. (Husband 52, me 29) Our \textbf{sex} life is amazing, we have a lot of passion, he knows what he is doing, I love him and am super attracted to him Everything's is as it should be... I think people like to judge but love is love at that at the end of the day. I know I could easily get someone my \textbf{age} but, yea NO been their done that.  That thought just make my stomach turn.  I love who I am with and That's all that matters.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Sex & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/105 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.905 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I am 29 and my husband is 52 years of \textbf{age}. We are 23 years apart I believe. We have been together for more than 7 years. I'm gonna get this in the way really fast I don't have any daddy issues. No I am not a gold digger, ha ha ha but I never really pay attention but I assume that's what a lot of people think sometimes especially when We go on vacation.  My Mim take offense at that comment because my parents are actually 12 years apart and my mom is really pretty. I just usually blow it off if it gets brought up or you hear something in the background and take it as a compliment I don't really care anyways. That's actually take him for a little bit more wealth of the family And I personally am successful on my own. I'm a business owner. I grew up in a loving family, I had probably an above  average childhood, with a lot of activities, good schools, family trips, stability, etc. My parents are still together and there was very loving, supporting nurturing parents. I'm actually just a tad bit closer to my father than I am my mother, but we still get along very good well. She's just a bit closer to my sister, that's all. I talk to both of them on a daily basis  Pay for around 10 to 30 minutes each. My husband also very family oriented and he visits his father on a daily basis also for around the same amount of time. I grew up in a loving upper middle class family. When I met my Paul before anything started I was not looking for relationship and had no interest in getting into one. I had that attitude for over two years. Over that timeframe I really had no attraction to anyone that even stands out or that I could think of, Not even mildly. But I have a feeling when you're not looking for love it makes the right person just stand out like \textbf{crazy}. It was almost like was like love at first sight. It kind of was like every single person around me was in black-and-white and Paul was in color. He stood out like \textbf{crazy} to me and I couldn't get him out of my head and I just wanted to hang out, it's a known better, end it was just like A switch flipped inside of me. I went from being totally on interested in anyone to totally lusting after him. I thought he was super attractive,  it's actually in a \textbf{weird} I never really noticed there was an \textbf{age} difference between us I guess it was mentioned a few times but never something that even cross my mind. I never thought he looked older or anything. I get pissed off if he says he is an \textbf{old} man, I just didn't sound right in my head and I don't see him like that and I was 10 if you don't curse of Norman and I tell you youat them any kind of a man likeIn the video She's kind of self-conscious over the whole \textbf{age} gap I honestly. I think my husband is handsome  and I don't don't care what other people think we are in our own little world and I think we usually make a scene just because were just so wrapped up in each other any which way. LOL I'm quite lucky that no one thinks he's my father. Due to the fact that he's Hispanic and I'm not. I'll take that back I think it happened once or twice. Usually people just don't exactly know what the relationship is and doesn't wanna be wrong. For example when we Like when we go stay at a hotel they usually assume we went two beds automatically and then look at us in a confuse manner when we say we only want one bed. My husband also says he had to wait x amount of years and he had always dreamed about a women just like me. Believe it or not i'm the one who chased him. But I see we have a really good relationship I couldn't imagine being with anyone different and mess with the kid at heart. But honestly He is still very responsible. He doesn't act like he's his \textbf{age} you there in terms of physical ability is still very physically fit it has a nice body. He's eating never personally bothered me. But when he found out by his \textbf{age} he was a little bit taken aback. He thought I was older that I was due to the fact my mom doesn't look her \textbf{age}. She looks a good 15 almost 20 years younger than she is. He that is in my 30s I was really just in my early 20s. Not because they look \textbf{old} or anything but just because my mothers looks and how well spoken and mature I am.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Crazy, Old, Weird & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}11/835 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.317 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small When I was 22 I started dating a man who was 34. I was an emotionally mature 22 year \textbf{old} who had lived on her own since 18 and was putting herself through school. I say this now that a decade has passed after that brief relationship.; I was mature for my \textbf{age}, but not grown, and I was not grown enough to recognize the difference. Any person who is significantly older than you and can relate to you in a romantic way for any sort of lasting relationship is emotionally deficient and stunted themselves. And as you grow further into adulthood, you will leave them, emotionally and from a maturation standpoint, behind. You will evolve and they will not. Very rarely does a relationship like this last long. And when it does, it's because one party has money and the other stays like a parasite in order to live a comfortable life. I wish her well, but I honestly hope for her sake this relationship doesn't last and she can enjoy her youth with people her own \textbf{age} and find someone to grow with, not in spite of.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}3/189 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.587 \\  \hline

I found such a strong connection with my husband. We have a really deep bond, I love him both physically and mentally which when you have both it is love like no other. I find him very attractive. It helps that he has a nice body, handsome, The last time I hung out with my dad he snapped a photo of Paul and Eric I meant Paul is a really good looking guy. Very handsome he looks like a Italian model or maybe an Italian mobster. I course my dad had to throw in the joke at the end. It helps that he's naturally fit.can I tell him I don't knowand is really fit. I torture him with healthy eating, vitamins, a little exercise, etc. because I want him to live a long healthy life by my side. But I did pretty good because his dad is 90 years \textbf{old} and still living in his own house and doing pretty good. He looks like he's in his 80s so he's pretty good genetics. We go hiking, fishing, I love to do a lot of physical chores outside but other than that it's just natural. He is like 56 and 160 he has muscle definition etc.the only characteristic that sticks out is that he has salt and pepper hair.

The mentality of a very experienced, very mature teenager it's not going to be remotely similar to that of someone in their 50's or 40's. Even if the latter had little experience and it's not very mature, the mentalities won't match, and in general, the younger person would be more easy to take advantage of. At least for me it's not about how big is the \textbf{age} gab, but more where is situated, teens and early 20's make me doubtful about how legit and honest the older person was. if teenagers are not \textbf{old} enough to drink \textbf{alcohol} in some places, maybe they are not \textbf{old} enough to differentiate other good ideas from bad ideas on another scenarios either\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Old, alcohol & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Behavioural Addiction - Alcohol & \cellcolor{green!5}5/132 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.788 \\  \hline

But I cannot blindly apply that logic to everything without having a second thought. Our brains are not fully developed until we are 25 (more or less). That means that when this relationship started, it was between two legal adults(I hope), but only one of them had an adult brain at the time.

I was 22 and he was 45 I believe 100 that you really love him and he really loves you, but this is so wrong in so many ways....Imagine your \textbf{sexual} life when you will be at his \textbf{age} , that is scientific approved that 40's are  the best  years for a woman's \textbf{sex} life .He will be 70 years \textbf{old} OR more.  The satisfaction you may have now will be gone. And if you have a baby which I understand the reason you want it with the person you love , he will not be able to do father - daughter  father - son stuff. He will be tired ,possible not healthy , and way far away from the kid's mind which is bad for their communication and understanding . I TRULY BELIEVE in miracles and rare things and  i hope this is one of them for you. Meaning that you will not mind that the \textbf{sex} will change , that you need to care and treat him , that he will not be able to follow you with same energy at the things you want in your life and last but not least if he dies way much sooner than you . I hope you will not regret it afterwards ... May your dreams come true . Because mine didn't I did put my logic in front of my feelings.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Y S He is selfish because she's an adult in the eyes of the law, but she's really a child, as her brain will continue to mature into her mid 20s!  So he's taking advantage of a child. No one can tell me they're the same person they were when they were 20, or have the same opinions they had when they were young and naive! He's already been there and done that. He should've let her enjoy her life before settling down and told her as much. That's about as selfish as one can get. It's apparent she has some daddy issues, whether she admits it or not. Not to mention, she started dating him in her late teens...gross.  He robbed her of her best years. And like the lady above wrote, he WILL get possessive and nutty when she starts realizing she made a huge mistake. I'd bet my bottom dollar on it. No one can tell me this is either normal or healthy. What the hell do they talk about?!  They're on two different levels and have \textbf{nothing} deep to share. She needs a therapist to unravel why she's settling for Moses and not dating guys more suitable to her \textbf{age} and guys who are in the same place in life.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small You guys would be surprise about how \textbf{weird} it gets some times with the \textbf{age} gap. When I was 47, I went out with a 20 year \textbf{old} model. I didn't pursue that relationship, she did. Because I was supposed to be the "mature" one, I stop that relationship quickly before it developed into something too strong to be undone. Otherwise, it could have turned into a very serious relationship. Then when I was 51, another model 22 y.o. Same, I didn't pursue that relationship, she did. Same outcome, I had to put on the brakes. I'm only citing 2 cases, but the truth is, during my 40s and early 50s, girls in their early 20s and even younger were totally available for me. Still today I can't believe it. I don't understand what makes a beautiful young girl who can have almost any guy she wants, go for a ridiculously much older man. I think in the back of their minds they know it's temporary and they take it as "a taste of what life will be in the future".

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Sanna Jo  I know the bible don't be silly, pre-flood men lived long lifespans (almost a thousand years) for them having a child at a couple hundred years \textbf{old} wasn't  having a child as an \textbf{old} man. God gave them those long lifespans for the purpose of populating the earth, (after the flood for example there were only 4 men alive.)   The instances in the Bible where people had children at  advanced ages ( some of them even while  being unable to conceive/sterile  ) was just God proving a point that \textbf{nothing} was impossible for him, it was done on purpose so people wouldn't take credit for the pregnancy themselves.  The proof that God does not intend for people to have children at advanced ages is the fact that women cease to menstruate at an average \textbf{age} of 52 yrs \textbf{old}, and men lose their \textbf{sex} drive gradually hitting a pronounced low after  50.  There are anomalies and exceptions to this of course , there are males that are sexually active well in their 70's but from a moral point of view, is it fair for a child to grow up never being able to play with his 70yr \textbf{old} dad or worse to lose his dad before he turns  10?  In my opinion the answer is no. \textbf{Old} people should either cease to have \textbf{sex} or use protection to avoid pregnancies.  Again it's my opinion you have yours .

Of course, financial stability is definitely a plus point (especially when raising children), but a relationship founded solely on wealth is not true love, and the older man is being cheated.

They look really happy together. Maybe they just have \textbf{common} interests and open minds. It's difficult to be that happy within many couples. If she's of legal \textbf{age} to marry it's difficult to see the harm. Blaming him is like saying a \textbf{woman} in her twenties has no right to do what they want with themselves. I don't think I'd do this myself but I don't see the harm in them doing it. I hope they are very careful in avoiding divorce as it's potentially more likely for \textbf{age} difference marriages. They should consider marriage counseling at the drop of a pin and not wait until there's any real problems. Not saying it's a problem because same \textbf{age} marriages nowadays have a really high divorce rate compared to marriages a while back so their chances may not really be that different. Not sure why people wouldn't be supportive of them. If it really bothers you don't criticize them try to change the laws.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I cannot explain it but I have a few guesses. I do think it may come natural as I like older guys myself.There are many factors.(*These may not apply to the couple in the video or anyone at all.*These are personal perspectives and opinions as to why or how. All assumptions of possibilities.*This is in no way meant to be offensive to anyone at all.*Some of these may come from personal experiences, views and observations.*Try not to judge too soon, please and thank you.)1. You see most guys your \textbf{age} being try hards, wanting the best looking girls with the "bad"(subjective to different points of views) attitude mostly. So you just lose faith in them and look for someone who actually cares on a personal level.2. Feeling a bit older than the rest, seeing everyone being childish and feeling a fish out of water till this man appears and gives you hope.3. Being a rebel against society and/or their beliefs.4. Fear of being used by same \textbf{age} or younger due to their commonly known maturity levels.5. Possibly being somewhat lonely and finding good company in this stranger which grows into friendship and then a relationship. (Yes, sometimes becoming friends works better than straight and forward asking someone out.)6. Having a natural preference for older.7. Seeing actual effort in the relationship, no matter how innocent it is where as to looking elsewhere doesn't seem to work.8. Being open minded and maybe even being around more open minded people.9. Knowing he cannot have kids, meaning ability to do all you want without limitations which is not what younger guys do. Some women even have to go get "funny"(It is actually scary in my opinion but many seem to take it very lightly.) stuff to not get pregnant (some regret it later anyway). - Point: More freedom, more carefree, no young pregnancy risks, ability to enjoy and figure out your life without the bomb10. Pity, compassion, empathy which evolve in time.11.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Greetings from Vancouver, Canada. I want to congratulate you for being brave to defy prejudices, taboos, and moral bullsh*t from society. What it's important is the love that you feel for each other. My father was 25 years older than my mother. You probably would say "oh, that's not so bad", but my dad was 41 and my mom was only 16 when they started their relationship (\textbf{Age} of consent is 16) and they had an amazing relationship for 44 years until my dad died at 85. If she had married a guy only 4 years older probably she would have divorced him in 5 years, but my dad was a smart man who knew how to play all the roles a man can possibly play for a \textbf{woman}: father, lover, best friend, brother, son, confidant, accomplice, guide, guru. leader, protector, provider, and loyal companion. People will probably think that I'm \textbf{weird} or sick, but I want to replicate in my life the story of my father. His example showed me how happy a relationship can be despite a huge \textbf{age} gap, as long as the man knows how to play all the important roles for his \textbf{woman}. When I was 35 I met a beautiful 16 year \textbf{old} girl who needed love and affection, and we started a beautiful relationship that I hoped it would last forever, but after 1 year of living together her family intervened, and took her away from me, shattering her dreams and my hopes. Now I'm 50 and  my hope has not died ...to find a girl who would like a relationship with an older man. I know there are many such girls in the world. Thank you for sharing this video. You have a new subscriber, and friend.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Old, Weird, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}5/295 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.695 \\  \hline

I never have any problem when i was with my late husband. Yes it is true that i was too spoiled. \textbf{Nothing} extravagant. He gave me the kind of love that we have to respect each. No fights, didnt have any problem even when it comes to financial. The only advice i can give this lady. Do not allow yourself to be spoiled because when the time comes that he will leave you or when he dies. At least you have something to fall into, you need to have alao experience to go work. So you could later support yourself when his gone. Which i did that. I was just lucky that i do have relatives that help during the time when he pass away. Talking about relatives on his side. You have to be aware about inheritance. Since when it comes to money and properties that will be a problem. Even thou my late husband gave all the properties and money.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I was married for 26 years to a \textbf{woman} older than me by five years.  She was a radical feminist and made my life hell.  Later I came to know that her hatred for men was because she was sexually molested as a child and was not treated for it.  I was the man in front of her every day and she would take out all her anger on me.  This in turn brought out the worst in me.  After my divorce I vowed never to have a serious relationship let along marry again.  But fate has its own way.  Today I am Larry's \textbf{age} and am married to a lovely \textbf{woman} who is 20 years younger than me.  She is such a wonderful, feminine, homely, caring person and its such a joy to be with her.  Really I want to tell young people to not think of \textbf{age} as an issue between two people having a successful relationship.  First of all there must be love and a connection, but to have a long term successful marriage, it is all about give and take, compromise.  Always rate your issues on a scale of 1 to 10.  If its up to a 4, just let it go, if its a 5 to 7 then bring it up in a comedic manner, in a passing manner.  But if its an 8 to 10, then you have to sit down with your partner and tell them how the problem is affecting you and come to a proper resolution.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}4/255 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.569 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small My father, who is 75, has a 4 year \textbf{old} girl with his wife, who is not yet 30.  (I am 44, btw).The pregnancy was not natural--it took the couple many months--more than a year--of fertility clinic treatments, and an embryo that "took" was finally carried to life by my father's young wife. YOUNG, YOUNG wife. I think that love between such an \textbf{old} man and such a young \textbf{woman} (girl, really), is not "normal", is not "natural", and is probably messed up. I mean, I am sure that my dad has issues regarding sexuality and \textbf{gender} relations, or else, he would be able to fall in love with women who are, if not his \textbf{age}, at least not from subsequent generations. I think that he cannot love a "peer"--he needs to care for, protect, and guide a young \textbf{woman} who is not his equal. What drives a young \textbf{woman} like my father's wife to marry an older man? Economic and emotional stability, for sure, in my dad's wife's case. She loves him, now, I know: as her protector, her savior, even, the man who has made her life so much better, hers and her family, for, not being wealthy, my father's income in the East Asian country where they live is worth three times as much as it is worth anywhere in the US... perhaps some young women are messed up, too, though, and they do not want an equal, a peer, but a father-figure, a man who will protect and guide them...   I don't think that a \textbf{sexual}, romantic relationship should be based on such unequal entry points: a young person protected, guided, lorded over, by an older, wiser person. BUT, then again, so what? Both my dad and his wife know that the girl born into their family will be left fatherless rather soon in life. But my dad's wife will be young enough to remarry if she wants--and she has the support of parents and siblings, all of whom are MUCH younger than my dad...\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Gender, Old, Sexual, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}8/340 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.353 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Y'all don't get it; I was raised without a father so I've always been attracted to older men.  It's not daddy issues for me anymore because I understand what I went through when I was younger and I know right from wrong.  But my first love; I was 21 and he was going on 51 .  I loved him and still love him.  He was my everything, through the years I learned what kind of man he was. I moved away from him, kept in touch, but learned who I was as a person.  He happened to be controlling and he's a man that doesn't really respect women.  You can imagine a man with not much respect for his own mom.  Those type of men are damaged.  Looking back now at 27; I love him but I know better now.  I still like older men and honestly don't even see myself with anyone my \textbf{age}.  It just doesn't feel right.  I got over those daddy issues because I sought out my own father and got passed those wounds but bottom line I love older men.  At 27 my \textbf{age} max is 50.  Maybe 52.  And of course he's an established man because if I wanted to date someone still trying to get on their feet I'll find someone my \textbf{age}.  But they don't come with wisdom and guidance.

Weak Bill Gates won't cut it.Man younger i.e. say 5 years older than girl means such a couple can be bubbly love based.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/152 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.658 \\  \hline

Some maybe ok, not being that close to someone in that way.  Also, u have to realize having a couple relationship can be very hard, u don't necessary have a day off.  U working on your relationship when your not working n when your not working, that's when u have to still work on it.  The job of being married or on long term relationship may be one of the toughest in the world. I don't consider just because your getting money a job, but also living on earth. Ur working so you can keep on breathing, don't u.  So as long as your breathing, your working.  It's all your weakness besides your strength comes out eventually, the good, the bad and ugly in marriage or long term relationship.  In this way it's a good thing, it's till death or you may wish it.  Such kind of relationships are not meant to last forever.  Eternity is with the Lord. We all have relationship with the eternal Lord where here or in the after life.  The relationship with wife or husband is having a similar relationship with God, but with some that is much less than perfect. No human is, we will show our bad side sometimes as well as your righteous side.  It's a balancing act.  This constant relationship is good that it is not for eternity but till death. Imagine if a couple went through that forever, they may go nuts. So a marriage is actually a promise to God that you will keep the constant balance act to love each other, till you are free n be directly with the Lord again.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Old, Sex, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/354 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.847 \\  \hline

It's really obvious by your comment you have never been in love. Not really. Because if that theoretically happened to you, and it was genuine love, and you gave it up and tried to find someone else, it could be years, decades before you find anyone who measures up as a replacement or perhaps, never.

My future is not with them. Literally, time has made that decision. There's so much more that comes with \textbf{age} people just dont want to admit. As people \textbf{age} in general their libido lowers, so goodbye to any kind of exciting \textbf{sex} life, and lets not pretend that on the long run that wont be a real problem. Getting pregnant when ur with an older guy or having kids with an older \textbf{woman} is just not realistic given the objective quality of their reprodictive organs. Get ready for family issues, or maybe getting completely shut off. People like to say their life is their life, and more power to them I guess, but having a family behind you to have your back is an important factor in life. Lots of people need that support and security. Then we get to how compatible a couple is mentally. With a 30 year \textbf{age} gap there's barely anything you will have in \textbf{common}. I'm not talking about shallow stuff like "oh yeah we both like sports and healthy food" type of stuff. Im talking about the way you look at life through a whole different lens cause of the experiences or lack thereof one has had.I could go on and on, but im a logical person.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The problem when there is too much of a gap is psychological. When there is such a wide gap or difference the older of the two almost always assumes a position of control or that of a patriarch or matriarch. The couple does not really grow together in experiences because the older one has already been there. So the growth aspect of the relationship lacks. I would say anything greater than 5 years may suffer from that. One has to also wonder why the older one did not find a more contemporary mate. Please don't reply with irrelevant aphorisms. I am talking about real psychological differences, never mind the physical ones because there is no way in hell a 60-year-\textbf{old} man can match himself at 40-years \textbf{old} in \textbf{sexual} performance.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small no its love pretty sure. I was in my 20's when I felt for an \textbf{old} dude around 55 and the way he approached me was inside a library and he walked up to me asking if I needed help with something and he helped. He had a limo and a 2 story house that he never said anything about and so we connected and his personality was what I liked in a guy. He was gentle always but in the end he played mind tricks on me. He never touched me but wanted to teach me how to love him. I don't know why but I was always the person who got in a relationship with a guy and they always tell me I never listen and always doing what I want to do. Like no man laid their hands on me or called me names. They always either helped me and bought me stuff and was nice to me but there's always something in the relationship that made me fall out of love with the guy. I was no gold digger and only looking for long lasting healthy relationships and they all were not healthy for me.  one of them never grew up but moved in with me when i was 23 we were not married and he was my first love. Then the second one I met a man \textbf{age} 56 we both attended church and was having \textbf{sex} out of marriage as well but he started using the \textbf{mental} abuse method slowly but im glad i left soon before I found out how worse it could get.  Then there was a man I dated \textbf{age} 43 for 2 years and had a baby by and left him due to the bad smoking habits got worse over time. I always thought he was the only man in the world I could trust and I looked up to him so much. (he was the first white guy I dated).

I suppose if I was in my mid 40s I could do this, but in my 50s maybe not because I would miss out on grandkids and I would just be far to \textbf{old} for her and my family. I also suppose I could give her financial freedom and a nice home and stability right out of the gate. Still its a big \textbf{age} gap and she wouldn't understand some of the things I am into because often it's things 80s and 90s kids were into.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Interesting story... between me and my husband there is also a similar \textbf{age} gap of 26 years. We met when I was 19, and people have been always looking at me as a gold digger because he used to have a nice car, because I seemed to be young and stupid. They were just judging all the time...and doing stupid useless questions- oh well, what will you do in 20 years when he will get \textbf{old}...or when he will die. Some people can't imagine themselves in certain  situations and that is why they believe them impossible. People the life is NOW, and the life is here. I want to live every second. It's been beautiful 13 years now..people in the meantime got bored talking about us. They stopped looking at me as a gold digger as I got a nice job, did career and have been financially completely independent over years. I could not wish for a better man in every aspect.

You don't NEED to have kids. Also, there are so many unwanted kids who are up for adoption! Adopt, dammit! Don't make your husband get a reverse vasectomy because of what you suddenly want, despite being supposedly "okay" with it in the beginning. Or get implanted. There are options! What is it with women who think their dreams of having kids ENDS with the news that their hubby/boyfriend is shooting blanks?! \$6,000 is NOT worth it! I didn't know it costs \$2k for implantation. That's ridiculous. I just did a bit of research on the cost of adoption, which is also \textbf{crazy} expensive, but can be done for free or low cost through foster care. So, yes, totally doable on a budget. While I do understand her parents' concerns, I wish they weren't so fixated on them being "alone" if they don't have kids. They have each other, a cat, friends, and family. They're not alone. That's like saying my fiance and I are gonna be miserable and alone because we're choosing to not procreate. >.> Yeah... and our fun, lighthearted conversations about our future furbabies is totally covering for the fact that we're both dying on the inside about our lonely, bleak years ahead of us.   ;;; I admit they do look like a fun couple.

From the time we're born, people say to live the life you want, you only get one chance, look back and be able to say "No regrets, I did it my way." And so few of us actually live that way.

Her whole family seems pretty smart and cool as well. And even if they do have a kid, it will be college-aged when the dad starts to slow down. Not the end of the world. So for everyone judging and condemning this choice and pretending they know what's best for someone else's life: you don't know. None of us know.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Kris 82 You're right, bud. I was blinded by how much I loved her, but she never really cared about me at all. She just drained me. We were friends for about 6 months, then we started dating. I loved the facade she portrayed as a caring, honest, gentle person. I proposed to her 9 months later, and we were married a year after that day. 6 weeks into the marriage sure turned into a total narcissist. She became very secretive, started flirting with everybody, and stopped wanting to be intimate. I caught her one night getting way too close to one of my friends, and confronted her about it. She suddenly got out of control. That was the moment I knew she was a narcissist, and she was hiding who she was the entire time, up until the marriage. She told me after she left that she was just using me for \textbf{sex}, and to get popular, and that she had been sleeping with three other men the whole time we knew each other. So yeah, I'm still pretty messed up. It's gonna take somebody really special for me to trust again. But I definitely leaned how to spot a narcissist now, and how to be much more careful. By the way, do you know what a narcissist is? Just wondering, because most people don't really know what one is.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Sex & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/231 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.433 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Yes I know what it is. It's a person so into themselves and their beauty that all they care about is themselves, with women you can see their narcissistic side when they check themselves out constantly in mirrors, windows, etc. I've come to realize over the years there is a constant fight between white (love) and \textbf{black} (ego, evil) energy in this world. Very many people have split personalities, where sometimes their good side manifests themselves other times the bad egotistical side takes over. Whenever you expose the evil deeds to a very egotistical person and confront them you're always faced with hostility. You're a good person and this was an attack on you by the evil meant to break you down. I've gone through plenty of those, although with women I've always been cautious as my parents were fighting with eachother viciously when I was younger. That led me to be very careful and analytical of women out of fear of getting my potential children through a disfunctional family experience. I went out with plenty of them throughout the years but I always noticed these small cues that something was wrong, often times I saw them flirting with others or looking at them when with me. It always led me to give up on them and move on as I'd rather not take the risk of going through what you and so many others went through. There are good women out there but they're more behind the scenes. I hope you find your other half that will refill your cup. It's always a fight though, \textbf{nothing} comes easy when you don't go by the mainstream rules of materialism, \textbf{sex} and quick rewards. All the best to you my friend.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Look, see past what you see on the surface, what their bodies look like. The man is not \textbf{elderly} and she's not a teenager, these are two adults. They are capable of living life together and could raise a family if they wanted. It's well known that women mature a bit faster than men, and with maturity comes different expectations out of life. Don't we all want to obtain the goals we want out of life? Whatever that is. To find a loving partner and experience real love, to have fulfillment in the work you do, to feel you have a purpose or to have children and create a family. What is wrong with someone pursuing what they want if it's not harming another person...even more so if what you are pursuing brings joy to another human being. Don't you think the world would be a better place if MORE people found personal happiness like these two have? The world would improve if more and more people would and could find happiness, joy and love. These two have found that. I'm not a \textbf{woman}, but I can understand that she most likely finds a maturity and a level-headedness in this man she's met, that she most likely wouldn't find in a 20-something year \textbf{old} man. For you men out there, think about what you were like in your mid 20's, even into your 30's. You were probably impulsive, irresponsible with things in your life, valued personal satisfaction and fun over more important things, didn't have your career objectives quite sorted out yet, most likely had the "fire" of your youth in regard to being jealous, a bit insecure about yourself. Sometimes and rightfully so, this is not something women want to deal with. They don't want to take on the burden of the issues of your youth. A solution for some women can be to find a well established older man to partner with and avoid the drama of youth. Does anyone agree or am I completely off base here?I know a lot of the toxic comments are most likely from very young men who see this purely from a \textbf{sexual} standpoint. These two have been together for 7 years now, so at this point, you most likely know this is for real. This is the real deal that has staying power and has produced a deeper love. That passionate early relationship \textbf{sex} thing wears off after a while in a long term relationship. You'll have passionate moments, but they won't be as frequent as they were in a brand new relationship. It becomes something deeper and more meaningful with time. Think about this for a minute.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I am also that type of person who is into older men. They are more mature, wiser, and smarter which are the reasons why i fell for a guy 9 years older than me. I met him last summer. He had more experience in life than me and he taught me a lot. I was just a 16 year \textbf{old} girl trying to find meaning in life next to a man who followed his bliss. I wanted to runaway with him so bad. Depression and anxiety have \textbf{nothing} to do with crying and being sad. Its the constant feeling of being numb, scared and tired at the same time. When he first came into my life, I actually felt something for the first time in a while. As we got closer, things felt so different. The feeling was something beyond. I was blissful.I have never been myself ever next to someone but him. I told him I wanted to runaway with him and that was the time when we lost in touch. I was going \textbf{crazy} about running away and maybe that's why he left. Soon I realized he was a good man. He did only what was good for me even though he wanted to runaway with me.

We were never into any \textbf{sexual} relationship.People say you never miss the person, you miss the feeling. But I miss the feeling and him both so much because he was a man unlike any other.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The fact that the doctor doesn't mention that the child might grow up with health complications is sorta concerning? It's been shown that babies born to an older father, 45+ years, tend to have more medical issues than those born to a younger father. This could include premature birth, lower birth weight and being admitted to neonatal intensive care (14 of babies studied who have been born from an older father).Studies have also shown that 18 of the babies studied, based on researchers at Stanford University, have a higher chance of getting seizures and score very low on the Apgar health test, not to mention that the mother had developed gestational diabetes, or at least the risk was higher, when conceiving with an older partner. Michael Eisenburg, a \textbf{senior} author on this report, has come out and said, that couples should take into consideration not just the father's, but also the mother's \textbf{age} when family planning. 'This is something else to take into consideration,' he said. 'There are potential risks with waiting. Men should not think that they have an unlimited runway.' Eisenburg has also stated, however, that these complications aren't very significant, with the babies being only about 20g lighter or are born on average, less than a day premature. But WHY in the name of God would you want to take the risk?So, all the comments on here supporting their decision on having child and going on about how it's better to have a father who cares about their child instead of her being a single mother, think about the health complications that child may face because of this man. Also consider the fact that he hasn't even produced any semen in the last 25 years!  Unless they adopt or she gets an artificial insemination from a donor who is younger than good ol' Larry over here, the fact that he is quite \textbf{old} and could possibly bring a child into this world who isn't able to perform to his/her peak, overrules all of that.

Just like not every single person born from an older mother has a medical condition, but that does NOT mean that there aren't kids that have problems. What I did say was that children born from an older father TEND to be more prone to these things. I'm happy for you that you are a very healthy person and I also hope that you live a very long life, but just because you don't have any complications, does not mean someone else in the same situation doesn't.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small My ex boyfriend was 16 years older than me. At 24 when I met him, he was 40, well established, had a home, a car, a career...and I was just out of college and had met him when I was out of work. No, money is not why I started to date him...to this day, I'm honestly not sure why I did it other than not wanting to be alone. He waited on me hand and foot, took care of me financially (which I think ended up hurting me in the end more than helping me, it made me lazy and I think I lost my direction and motivation to be independent). I was also in the grip of active drug addiction (still, I swear, money was not my motivation behind starting to date him, but it started to become why I stayed). He knew I was a user, had seen me use, had given me money so I wouldn't be dope sick, had used other drugs with me (never used heroin with me but we smoked weed), I'm maybe getting too in depth here. I'm starting to just describe a very unhealthy relationship, mainly because of me. However, my ex seemed to find purpose in taking care of me, in picking me up when I fell, and he ultimately became my biggest enabler.I went to rehab and the second that I got clean I realized that I had to leave. I knew how to manipulate him with ease and was self aware enough to worry that I would relapse if I went back to him, knowing I could get drugs easily, knowing that I knew exactly what to say. He had become more like a father, and I more like his child...and I realized that I had to be high to have \textbf{sex} with him. I realize that this is completely different than the couple featured here. I realize that I was largely the problem...but I have known other females who dated much older men and it ended up in the same fashion, more of a dad and a daughter. It's gross to think about .I am happy that this couple has found love. They are FAR healthier than me and my ex were, very obviously. However there was still something that felt parental. Maybe it's just my past manipulating what I see, but I don't know.It was hard to not think that if we had kids, when they graduated college their dad might be in a nursing home (dramatic, but you know what I mean...) I thought about it all the time. The drugs kept me there.I cringe looking back, and I'm sorry this was long and maybe irrelevant because we were not healthy and this couple seems to be, and my blessings are with them (not that they matter), but I would say (\textbf{drug addict} or not lol): be cautious. Look at what you want your life to be 5, 10, 25+ years down the road. Consider if you want children, even if you don't want them right now.I have been clean now for a year and a half and am in a healthy, loving, amazing relationship with the love of my life, who is only 5 years older than me. We relate to each other more, we enjoy the same things, we understand each other much more easily, we see eye to eye. If she can feel that way with a man twice her \textbf{age}, wonderful. But I could not, and I think drugs or no drugs‚Äîwe would never have fit right. I already have one dad, I don't need another (and I certainly don't want to feel like I'm dating my parental figure).That was a gross period of my life.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Melito T I see what's your problem but why are you overthinking it and offended by what they do? They're not harming anyone in any way whatsoever and clearly they are both adults and also clear that they love each other. If you don't like it, don't get into a relationship w someone older/younger. Done. And why would a 14 year \textbf{old} be an adult? I get that some people are more mature than others despite their \textbf{age} but anyone younger than 18-21 are obvsly not adults or a legal \textbf{age} yet according to the law, there's the law for a reason but I also get that it's different in different countries/states. Even if one of them was a gold digger, if the other person is fine w it enough to marry that person, why let it ruin your day and let it bother you? And they obvsly know the person more than we do. And if the other person was a creep and just got married for \textbf{weird} \textbf{sexual} reasons, again, whatever, both of them aren't complaining and seem fine so I don't see any issue w it. If they have issues, they would tell someone. And they weren't force in an arranged marriage either like some families do. So unless someone who is a minor, underage and forcefully, got involved, then yes I think it's an issue. But if they're both adults despite the \textbf{age} difference, they can do whatever they want w their love life. And if you really don't approve of it, that's also fine as well becuz everyone has different opinions and clearly they don't need your approval. I don't think they expect everyone or anyone to approve of it either. I respect your opinion as every case is different but I don't think whatever you speculated is the case for them.

And of course, lots of women "need" men to take care of them to a certain extent. And in this case, it's even primal...i.e. physical protection from an security pro. In addition to the living quarters and other benefits like life insurance policy. lol  She's the "jackpot hitter".

A pedophile following his happiness, is being with a child.

I understand that this girl will do what she wishes. But I'm sure she will regret any life altering decisions she may make regarding him and children. And if she doesn't, she's selfish, because the child deserves 2 people who can be there for them for as long as possible. JUST LIKE SHE HAD THE PRIVILEGE TO HAVE. Taking that away from  another human-being just cause you wanted a specific unorthodox love story is SELFISH. We don't find it sad because she's beautiful and societal standards say she should be with someone physically equivalent, it's sad because if the roles were reversed we can't know if he would honestly be with her. And again the child deserves BETTER.This man can say what ever makes his last years of his life easier but we'll never really know! You probably didn't grow up around men. That's why you think this is 'cute'.And 'love beyond time'. That's just a hopeless romantic sort of view.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@QWEEN Kay kay, A lot of people assume that adoption is the easy alternative to having a biological child. The majority of people don't realize that it is extremely difficult to get approved for adoption, at least here where I am in NY, USA. I am physically \textbf{disabled} from an incomplete spinal cord injury that I sustained during an on the job attack. I have other complications from the assault and therefore it is very high risk for me to carry a pregnancy. My fianc√© and I looked into the possibility of adoption and even though we are financially stable (he works and I am retired), are in our early 30's, have been together 6 years, own our home, and are marrying this year, we are always denied because of my disability. Even though my mobility is limited, I can still walk with the aid of a medical device implanted in my spine, drive, do housework, etc. But in the eyes of the adoption agencies, I am deemed "unfit" to be a mother. The adopting couple must be in peak physical and \textbf{mental} health. So, it isn't cut and dry. Someone could have clinical depression and be completely stable, but because of the diagnosis, the couple would get denied. Also, it is extremely expensive and not many people have the money to do so. Average base fee are about \$30,000.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Disabled, Mental & \cellcolor{green!27}Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}2/230 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.87 \\  \hline
