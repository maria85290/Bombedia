  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The prejudice against \textbf{age} is in government jobs, the military, sports, businesses, and school systems. It is more so with females since the media projects the male image as never getting \textbf{old} like Donald Trump who can have a wife whose \textbf{age} is equal to that of his daughter, and he still can have the most powerful job as being president too. Globally, it is a male-dominated society, and it gets worse since women are expected to put her children in day-care to earn an income equal to her husband when prejudice in the job-world exits against not only her \textbf{age} but her \textbf{gender} too.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Gender, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}5/105 & \cellcolor{green!5}4.762 \\  \hline

\textbf{\Large Result analysis:}

\begin{itemize}\item Taking into account the words that were detected, we can reach the conclusion these comments are associated with : : Age - General;Gender - General;Age - Over 65s;%.

\item The percentage of hate speech related words is 3.8278.

\item Considering that the variable \textbf{Age - General} has the most occurences in the post, we can interpret that this is the predominant hate speech.

\item Overall there were 8/7 occurences of hate speech related comments.\end{itemize}\end{document}
