I wouldn't comment on this had I not been educated. Maybe you should take your own advice and go read on culture and religion. There is a BIG difference, yet most Arab men, though come from different cultures and different religions (because they Arabs do have DIFFERENT cultures and religions) all behave the same out of fear not respect. Ill save you the comment on 'maybe you just don't get it because you're not Arab.' Oh but I do. My Arab girl friends who are educated know this and the uneducated bunch scream out after them as 'whitewashed' because they can't say 'jealous' to their own kind lol. You tried.

But sometimes you got to do what u got to do. Sometimes there are priorities. For example my father is currently in Yemen with the rest of his family and he can't leave anyway because of the war and the chaos over there. There also no good food sources. Is that somewhere you want to be with your family or is that where you want to be placed. No of course not. It's not just because they feel like it sometimes in most cases they do it for a really good reason. Why would you want to flee ur home. Being Arab means putting your family first. Also I mean you can't say anybody in any other culture doesn't get easily sexually aroused. Naturally You tend to be sexually aroused no matter what.

But as an Egyptian, a Muslim Egyptian, and someone who has lived in SA for a minor part of my life let me tell you that none of the things you described happen. Like people getting shot and stabbed for not paying money or moving their cars? Lmao. I won't claim that my country is the epitome of cleanliness but it's not so dirty as to go whine about it on social media. Maybe your country really is fucked up enough to legit your complains but mine isn't. Also, yeah, it's a male dominated society and yeah, women rights are undermined even though Islam gave us so many rights but lol, if a guy tells me I can't laugh in front of him I will bitch slap him. And if a \textbf{woman} decides not to "give me" her son for marriage I'll tell her to go to hell and that its her son's loss. Not that I'm "looking for" marriage anyway because it is, I gotta say, another stupid system that people follow so blindly, they marry just for marrying and I will never be caught doing the same.And girls getting put down for having boyfriends? Gee, my last boyfriend would definitely like that after the way I dumped him. But my bro and my mom didn't seem to have a problems with me or my bf. If you come here to Egypt on Valentine's day, you'll see that 2/3 of the country are actually dating without prior official engagements, so I think it's safe to say that it's only your fucked up country that is too... well, fucked up. Forgive me if I sounded rude first or now but if I hate one thing, it's people dissing their countries and societies on social media, because it affects us all. But if what you say is true, you can go ahead and diss yours as much as you want, just make sure to say that this mostly, or maybe just only, happens in Jordan.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Natalie Pesick again, i did say i was jordanian and thats how arabs in my country are. So i didnt generalise to all arab countries like i know in morocco everyone is chilled. But even for my country i said most and i did end it everytime with "but not everyone is like that" because some individuals are different. Im happy for you that ur society is not as strict but generally speaking male arabs are controlling over the women and take advantage over them. I have 2 Moroccan family friends and theyre so strict on their children. My bestest friend is egyptian and she told me that in her extended family everyone is so jelous of the other and there was so many problems over money. Also she told me her experiences in egypt how because she was the best in class, girls used to threaten her with a knife to give them the answers in a test. Shes faced so many traumatic events in her childhood hence why now at the \textbf{age} of 20 shes suffering from depression anxiety and schizophrenia. And now there is still war happening over sissi and mursi. All this wouldnt have happened to her of she had lived in a country with strict law like the UK where we all live in now. So generally speaking most arabs are killing each other and the politians arnt even doing anything. Theres so many people dying in syria palestine iraq and other countries and no1 is doing anything about it. One thing i admire about jordan is that it accepted many refugees from syria palestine and iraq. But overall im ashamed of being arab because its just kinda fucked up really, but im ever so proud of being a muslim and following the sunnah. I am happy for u that u have a strong enough personality to stand up for urself and go against ur social norms and that is exactly what i would do. I do not belong to any society which is kinda sad, but i do follow my religion, my morals, my logic and my values so im happy to have an individual identity seperate to my society's.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/366 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.273 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Miss MIMI Actually no, in your first comment, you generalized. You said that the arabs do that because they are fake af and that they all do that to make their families look good, which is what really made me feel a bit annoyed.Yeah I do have to admit that we still have so many political issues, not Mursi no, more like the brotherhood who suddenly became a \textbf{terrorist} organization instead of a religious organization. And yeah, some people are fucked up here, personally, I've never been bullied on school and I've always made sure to stand by the ones being bullied because bullying sucks, but no one gets threatened by knives to give anyone answers that sounds like an exaggeration. If what she says is true, she should have reported it, simple enough. I don't know her circumstances and if she's anywhere near me I'd happily help her. But then again, every society has it's bright side and its dark side. The US and the UK have horrible dark sides too and I'd never swap living in Egypt for living in the UK like, everBottom line is that yeah, there's the bad and there's the good in every society. If you abandon ours for another, just please try to not diss it on every chance you get.P.S.: you belong to where you want to belong and frankly, I don't think it's a bad thing to not belong in any society so count your blessings ‚ù§\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Terrorist & \cellcolor{green!5}Religious Identity - Muslim & \cellcolor{green!5}1/249 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.402 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Rose M. Saleh maybe youre i right i apologise if i made u feel that way, but that the knife thing 100 happened to her, that was around 8 years ago and its ever so possible to happen + when youre threatend you dont know what to do cuz ur just too scared and she was too young to even understand that she needed to report it and even if she had without evidence the police wouldnt do shit. She told me thats how some girls in egypt are. i obviously know that the US and the UK arent perfect hence why i didnt say that i belong to thwir societies and yes i totally agree that every society has ups and downs 100 but western people tend to be much more open minded than most arabs and thats a fact and thats what i like about them. I am just someone who stands up for my rights as a human and i felt like jordanians have taken them away from me like for example no1 cares there about \textbf{mental} illnesses they believe its a minor problem whereas in the west they put a lot of emphasis on it and thats just basic human rights i also stand up for womens rights and i do admit arab countries have improved on womens rights which is a good sign like in other countries girls arnt getting education or there is forced marriages upon 12 year \textbf{old} girls so from that perspective i thank god that arabs arnt like that and i pray for the other countries that are like this. I really just wish that people try to imitate prophet Mohammed PBUH as much because thats the only way our society will improve and then id be proud to as Im arab.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Mental, Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}2/301 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.664 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Miss MIMI I guess we can agree on that. I'm also glad that our countries are finally giving girls some of their rights. Just yesterday my friend who lives in S.Korea was telling me that they have social discrimination and casteism. I mean who would have thought? But that is the thing you know, no matter how much a country would seem civilized and open minded, there has to be something. Anyway, I'm glad you left Jordan it seems like a \textbf{common} belief that Jordan sucks.
