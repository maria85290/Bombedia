  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Reply to BRAINWASHED Eva Bukhryakova:  [LINK]  Dangerous People Are Teaching Your KidsTravis Thacker11 months agoYea that works if you can get the majority on your side and the other children are smart also.  I got pretty much thrown in the special corner in school for doing things like that. No one would support me even when I could prove the Teachers lesson wrong by providing proof or other related materials that showed they had altered or skewed a test or series of tests so that certain students had a higher  chance of making a better grade.  Yea i got suspended for that one.   I had collected data for 4 weeks my 2nd year of HS all to prove a Female Teacher was being bias toward the male students by not providing them with the proper learning material all while giving the females in the class access to her personal laptop and internet related learning material directly related to the project we were working on.   I just got told there was \textbf{nothing} the Principal or board could do cause her family was big shit in our little town and that they knew she was holding back the male students in her classes so the females had a better chance at getting the scholarships awarded at the end of the term for that grade.  Her daughter was only 2 years behind me in grades but had friends in the same grade as I was and a cousin so the Bitch did her best to ensure the cousin and her friends always got first access to any internet time back then in the 90's which made a huge deal in research related material.    This bias shit has gone on so long it's not even funny and all it ever does is change from one \textbf{sex} to the other and from one \textbf{race} to the other depending on which \textbf{race} or \textbf{sex} is a bigger help to the political parties at the time.  That or whatever relatives they have matters more then anything else also. It's \textbf{nothing} more then human survival trying to ensure the better chance for there kin and genetics through \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} tape and other underhanded tricks used to weed out new comers in the game or competition.  All society has done in the last 5000 years is make the same \textbf{old} game of survival and genetic protection a vastly more complicated game rather then actually advancing social welfare and human progress.    Everyone thinks we have all these great creations and super great inventions but in reality any thing invented was only a means of make physical labor less for some and eliminate the need for others at the same time. All the while the same human problems persist and the same human bias and genetic protection goes on between the classes and between the bloodlines of people that actually believe it will matter in 300 years.  The reality of it is that it wont matter jack shit.  Genetics are by nature made to mingle and spread out among the population of a species to further weed out genetic flaws and traits that are not needed and nature always finds a way to do this in it's own sweet time no matter how hard man tries to change that fact.Mark Bradley2 years agoShort answer: Feminists took over the education system and have destroyed young men by design.darthvader5300 3 minutes ago +Mat Broomfield Men made life adpapted to suit men's needs and their families, and they did the same to their educational system based on the boys' and men's brain thinking pattern which allowed humanity to climb from caves to the moon!Feminized education IS a fail. "Numbers are a way that men oppress women; so what do you FEEL the answer is on your math-test?"Why is education failings boys? Let's ask two middle aged women. One has a nephew. That will get us to the bottom of things. Yeah, not bias at all. As usual, these morning shows are awful at discussing and debating societal issues.  If you think things are bad enough, Yvette Cooper (Labour MP) wants to make feminism a mandatory subject in education. Yes, that's right. She wants to impose her political ideology into our education system.  This is a disaster. If this were the other way around and the education system was failing girls, there would be an uproar. Society doesn't give a shit about male issues.Teachers biased in grading boys is really harmful. Schools should make it mandatory to grade tests etc. by codes and not names, so the teachers don't know who they're grading.To all nutcases and political correctness crowd concerning about men's rights. We Russians and our KGB knows more about what is going on in the western world and you are practicing political correctness and suicidal liberalism and self-destructive multi-culturalism by wrongly saying you are skeptical of men's rights when in fact THE MEN AND BOYS ARE BEING INDISCRIMINATED SYSTEMATICALLY SINCE THE 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, AND UP TO THE PRESENT 2016 WHICH EXPLAINS THERE SHOULD BE A MEN'S RIGHTS LAW ACT AND BOYS RIGHTS LAW ACT TO PROTECT THEM FROM RADICAL FEMINIST EXTREMISTS TEACHERS AND PROFESSORS WHO ARE USING SUBTLE METHODS TO FAVOR ONLY GIRLS BUT NOT FAVOR BOYS EQUALLY SO AS TO REMAIN UNNOTICEABLE AND UNDETECTED UNTIL IT IS TOO LATE! You westerners are the most brainwashed and brain dead people that have I ever encounter during my active years in the Russian intelligence service before my retirement! You should be ashame for your lies that there is no need for the vitally needed men's rights act and boys rights act to be made into law and as a mandatory policy for you you know already that your fellow men and the boys are being indiscriminated by rabid criminal radical feminist extremists in your schools, universities who are destroying the original curriculum based on real education and neutrality that does not favor any \textbf{gender} or \textbf{race} at all.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small JUST LOOK AT HISTORY AND YOU WILL SEE WHO CREATED THESE HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED CIVILIZATIONS THAT REQUIRES A LOT OF KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM AND SKILLS TO ACCOMPLISH THEM ALL. IT WAS AND IT IS STILL MEN!  It was men who explored the wilderness, it was men who tamed the world to make it safe also for their women and children, it was men who constructed the required infrastructures and technostructues to lay down the foundation of the industrial revolution. It was men who patrolled and manned the fortified outposts of the Wild West and the Silk Road, it was men who defended the borders and patrolled the rivers from the time of Sumeria to the time of Ancient Rome and it was even continued during the \textbf{Age} of Voyages to the New World and the \textbf{Age} of Discovery. It is only after men has tamed so much of the world (and fought each other that forged the military technologies that was later used for civilian peaceful purposes) that women were able to SAFELY participate in society. We men BLASTED THE WORLD TO TAME IT and now you indiscriminate against us after you are given a chance to participate in society.

When the goal is reached, they will be "lined up against the wall". 1984 interview with a former KGB agent and Soviet diplomat, Yuri Bezmenov.WHEN I WAS A YOUNG KGB OFFICER DURING THE COLD WAR I ASK A PSYCHOLOGIST WHY IS IT THAT EVEN THE MOST MEDIOCRE MEN HAS THIS TENDENCY TO TURN INTO NEAR GENIUS OR TOTALLY GENIUS ONLY DURING IN TIMES OF WAR AS DEMONSTRATED TIME AND AGAIN THROUGHOUT HISTORY AND DURING WW I AND WW II AND HIS ANSWER IS BECAUSE MEN ARE LONG TERM THINKERS AND WAR IS A LONG TERM PROGRAM REQUIRING FAST THINKING AND HIGHLY PATTERNED ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURES OF DUTY FUNCTIONS AND FAST READING AND COMPREHENSION AND ANALYSIS OF MILITARY INTELLIGENCE DATA GATHERING ACCOMPANIED WITH SWIFT REACTION-REFLEXES ON WHAT TO PLAN AND DO THE NEXT MOMENT. THIS MOTIVATES MEN TO BECOME FAST LEARNERS AND FAST DATA ASSIMILATORS TO CONNECT THE DOTS IN THE RIGHT PATTERN AFTER BEING FORCED TO LEARN TO SELECT WHICH DOTS OF INFORMATION MUST BE SELECTED FIRST! QUITE IRONIC THAT IT IS WAR AND ONLY DURING A WAR TIME PERIOD THAT MEN HAS THAT TENDENCY TO EXCEL. AND ONE \textbf{WOMAN} PSYCHOLOGIST SAID IT ALSO BECAUSE MEN EVOLVED FROM THAT HUNTER-GATHERER SURVIVALIST FOUNDATION THAT REQUIRES FAST LEARNING AND FAST THINKING AND FAST PERMANENT MEMORIZATION AND FAST COMPREHENSION OF THE SITUATIONS AND CIRCUMSTANCES FROM ONE MOMENT TO THE NEXT. A women psychologist during the Cold War said that to me. By the way, that \textbf{woman} psychologist is a KGB officer involved in psychological warfare conducted against American, targeting American women with all sorts of women's movement brainwashing techniques. That was way back in the late 1950s and early 1960s. And you Eva Bukhryakova happened to be in it's way and became it's victim either directly or indirectly through our creations that we did through a 2sd Party which are the Rockefeller Foundation and others whose weaknesses for money we exploited for our brainwashing operations against the American women. Destroy American womanhood you destroy wifehood and motherhood, you destroy that you destroy the American family, destroy the American family you destroy American society, you destroy America society you destroy the American military which is now facing A LOT OF PROBLEMS BEING COVERED UP BY THE LEFTIST-LIBERAL MEDIA AND BY THE PENTAGON. And we KGB won the psychological warfare! Which is why many retired KGB women involved in psychological warfare are LAUGHING AT WOMEN AT YOU, LOL, BECAUSE YOU FELL INTO THE TRAPS THAT THEY CREATED FOR YOU Eva Bukhryakova! LOL!THIS IS THE BASIS AND FOUNDATION OF SOVIET ERA EDUCATION FOR ALL RUSSIAN MEN. WE CREATED A CURRICULUM BASED ON THESE PSYCHOLOGICAL FINDINGS, TESTED THEM, IRON OUT THE KINKS, REFINE THEM, AND CREATED AN ACADEMIC SYSTEM BASED ON THE MALE'S BRAIN'S THINKING PATTERNS AND THINKING ATTITUDES. THE RESULT? A VAST RESERVOIR OF SCIENTIFIC, ENGINEERING, ANDTECHNICAL TALENT COMPOSED LARGELY OF MEN. AS FOR THE WOMEN WE CREATED A CURRICULUM BASED ON THE FEMALE'S BRAIN'S THINKING PATTERN.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@nathanlief PhysicsRadiationMarie Curie (born Maria Salomea Skłodowska) was the first \textbf{woman} to receive a Nobel prize for her works on radiations and, up until today,[when?] the only \textbf{woman} to receive two Nobel prizes (among them, one Nobel prize in chemistry for discoveries on Polonium and Radium). She is the sole laureate to be recognized within two distinct scientific areas.Fanny Gates further investigated the properties of radiation. Together with Ernest Rutherford, she amassed evidence that radioactivity was not the result of any simple chemical or physical processes.[21]In particular, Gates showed that radioactivity could not be destroyed by heat or ionization due to chemical reactions, and that radioactive materials differ from phosphorescent materials both qualitatively and quantitatively.[22]RadonIn 1901, Harriet Brooks and Ernest Rutherford contributed to the discovery of the element Radon by finding evidence that the 'emanation' emitted by thoriumcompounds was likely to be a gas [23]. This follows work in 1899 by Pierre and Marie Curie, who observed that the gas emitted by radium remained radioactive for a month.Kinetic energyEmilie du Châtelet (born Gabrielle Émilie Le Tonnelier de Breteuil) translated Isaac Newton's Principia Mathematica from Latin to French during the 18th century. She carried out physics experiments, popularizing the work of Leibniz. She demonstrated that the kinetic energy of an object was proportional to its mass and the square of its velocity, and postulated a conservation law for the total energy of a system.Heavy elements in cosmic radiationAs a graduate student, Phyllis S. Freierfound evidence for the existence of elements heavier than helium in cosmic radiation.Her work was published in Physical Review in 1948 with co-authors Edward J. Lofgren, Edward P. Ney, and Frank Oppenheimer.[25]Beta particles are electronsGertrude Scharff Goldhaber and her husband Maurice Goldhaber showed that beta particles were identical to electronsTop quarkMelissa Franklin's team at Fermilab found some of the first evidence for the existence of the top quark. Nuclear shellMaria Goeppert Mayer, a German \textbf{immigrant} to the US who studied at Johns Hopkinsduring the Great Depression, persisted in her studies even when no university would employ her and became a chemical physicist. Her most-famous contribution to modern physics was discovering the nuclear shell of the atomic nucleus, for which she won the Nobel Prize in 1963. Slow lightLene Hau led a Harvard University team who used a Bose-Einstein condensate toslow down a beam of light to about 17 metres per second, and, in 2001, was able to stop a beam completely.AstatineThe Austrian physicist Berta Karlikdiscovered that the element 85 astatine is a product of the natural decay processesBohr–van Leeuwen theoremIn her 1919 thesis  Hendrika Johanna van Leeuwen explained why magnetism is an essentially quantum mechanical effect, a result now referred to as the Bohr–van Leeuwen theorem. (Niels Bohr had arrived at the same conclusion a few years earlier.)FranciumIn 1939 Marguerite Perey, a student of Marie Curie, discovered the element francium by purifying samples of lanthanum that contained actinium. Perey first noticed that the actinium she purified was emitting unexpected radiation. After further study she was able to isolate this new element which she named "francium" for France.Nuclear fissionAustrian-Swedish physicist Lise Meitner, together with Otto Hahn and Otto Robert Frisch, led the small group of scientists who first discovered nuclear fission of uranium when it absorbed an extra neutron. The results were published in early 1939.Meitner, Hahn and Frisch understood that the fission process, which splits the atomic nucleus of uranium into two smaller nuclei, must be accompanied by an enormous release of energy. Nuclear fission is the process exploited by nuclear reactors to generate heat and, subsequently, electricity.[34] This process is also one of the basics of nuclear weapons that were developed in the U.S. during World War IIand used against Japan in 1945.Structure of the Milky WayHeidi Jo Newberg's team found that Milky Way is cannibalizing stars from smaller galaxies and that the Milky Way is larger and has more ripples than was previously understood.Chirped pulse amplificationDonna Strickland received the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery of chirped pulse amplification, a technique which "paved the way towards the shortest and most intense laser pulses ever created by mankind."\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Immigrant, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/705 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.426 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small What does it mean to be smart?  How does one become smart?  If someone cannot do something or solve something as well as others, does that make them less smart?  Questions like these need to be answered before we can even begin considering if women are definitively smarter than men or vice versa.  'Smartness' is a slippery \textbf{slope}.  We have devised tests to measure how smart you are, but are they really accurate?  Do they actually capture all that it means to be smart?  Sure, maybe women have been scoring better than men on IQ tests (women are smarter, 2012), but is the test fair and unbiased, or does it accurately measure smartness?  Additionally, this video claimed that there are more women who graduate from college than men (women are smarter, 2012).  Does this mean that we are smarter or that there are greater forces at work here?  Consider for a moment how our societies function.  There could easily be an underlying issue helping/hindering genders that is invisible to us.We have also heard time and time again that women are not as good at math.  Is there something innate inside of us that makes these skills more difficult, or is it that we keep telling young girls that they should not be as good at it so they are just giving up more easily?  Additionally, you could be a genius and know everything there is to know about one field, and be completely clueless about another.  How smart is that person then?  Is there a ranking of what subjects we should know in order of smartest to dumbest?As you may be able to guess, I do not think there is an inherent answer to the question are women smarter than men.  It is impossible to answer for so many reasons.  I think that women and men are equally capable, with possible and extremely small differences due to our chemical make-up (ex. Estrogen and testosterone).  I think the field of science is still too young and there are way too many invisible social forces around us to tell us if the differences we see are due to something biochemically inside of us.  Yes, on average, women are different than men in some ways.  However, our differences may not be caused by what we think.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Slope & \cellcolor{green!5}Nationality - Chinese & \cellcolor{green!5}1/385 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.26 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Adi Mate As I said, this might be because women and men's brains are wired for different things. The reason more women take psychology and English (jobs that you say are somehow 'easier' than other jobs) is because women in general have better communication skills than men, and are emotionally much more intelligent then men. (Just think about it, psychology and English may be two jobs that are easier for women and harder for men.) So in a way, both genders are smarter than each other in different ways.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small MEN AND BOYS WERE DELIBERATELY INDISCRIMINATED AGAINST GRADUALLY OVER A PERIOD OF 20 TO 30 YEARS WITH THE USE OF FEMINIZATION OF EDUCATION THAT STARTED THROUGH "CO-EDUCATION"THAT BENEFITS ONLY GIRLS AND WOMEN BUT DELIBERATELY DISADVANTAGES AND MAKES IT HARDER FOR THE BOYS AND MEN. AND RADICAL FEMINIST EXTREMISTS OPENLY CREATED AN UNFAIR CURRICULUM THAT FAVORS ONLY THE FEMALE BRAIN THINKING PATTERN WHILE INDISCRIMINATING AGAINST THE MALE BRAIN THINKING PATTERN BY UNFAIRLY GIVING AND DIVERTING MORE RESOURCES TO MEET THE EDUCATIONAL NEEDS OF GIRLS AND WOMEN WHILE NEGLECTING AND IGNORING THE EDUCATIONAL NEEDS OF BOYS AND MEN WHICH ARE WHOLISTICALLY AND OUTRIGHT DIFFERENT FROM GIRLS AND WOMEN. I feel that all teachers should see this. As a young boy, especially in elementary, boys were treated like autistic shits, while girls were treated like royalty, and would always be used as a demonstration on what boys should act like. Boys only like to read action, attention grabbing books and are deliberately deprived of such books as a silent policy to indiscriminate against boys and men so that they are literally being destroyed psychologically and being destroyed intellectually because they are not being given books that are boys and men oriented but instead they are being INDISCRIMINATED IN A SUBTLE WAY BY THE FUCKING FEMINIST ANTI-MALE FEMALE MANHATING WOMEN WHO SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO BE TEACHERS OR EDUCATORS IN ANY WAY AND NOT BE ALLOWED TO BE TEACHERS OR EDUCATORS IN ANY INSTITUTIONS OF LEARNING IN THE FIRST PLACE! BUT THE ANTI-MALE WOMEN'S MOVEMENT (CREATED BY US KGB) WILL ALWAYS USE LIES OF POLITICAL CORRECTNESS BY LYING AND FALSELY ACCUSING SELF-DEFENDING MALE TEACHERS AND MALE STUDENTS OF BEING BIASED AND INDISCRIMINATORY AGAINST GIRLS AND WOMEN EVEN THOUGH THESE STUPID AND BRAINWASHED MAN HATER WOMEN TEACHERS AND WOMEN'S MOVEMENT KNOWS THAT THEY ARE THEMSELVES WHO ARE THE LIARS AND NOT THE MEN AND BOYS WHO ARE JUST DEFENDING THEIR RIGHTS TO EQUAL TREATMENT "AS MEN AND BOYS" AND THEY DESERVED NOT TO BE TREATED AS WOMEN AND GIRLS BUT AS MEN AND BOYS!Girls tend to be interested in more things than boys, hence why boys only like to read action, attention grabbing books. Girls obviously will score higher in reading since they are given books that interest them, rather than boys that can't focus on books that girls like. I remember in 5th grade when my teacher made our class read "fever" which is about a girl that grew up during the time of the \textbf{y\textbf{e\textbf{llow}}} fever. The girls finished the book by the end of lunch time, while the boys struggled to read it for weeks. If my teacher would of assigned two different books to different genders (YES, there are only 2), then they wouldn't have had the problem. Because of that book, I had to take a test on it which would base my level of reading to get in 6th grade. By the beginning of 6th grade, we found out what our scores were. Every individual boy scored at LEAST a 78, while the girls scored around 90-100. This is unfair and in result of that, (I am currently in 8th grade), I wasn't able to get into the honors class that specific year, which meant that for the duration I am in middle school (which I still am) I had to be put in average classes, in which I should of been out in honors, since I am gifted (I have an IQ of 146). The average classes pace is drastically too slow for me to follow, and I usually end up when asked a question, explaining far too more than a simple answer. This is unfair and because of poor decisions teachers made in elementary, it will affect the lives and future of the students (especially boys). I will have to stay in average classes until next year, when we will be doing an other placement test, where hopefully I will be assigned a book that I can stay focused on, and get into a good high school. ALL teachers must see this, to know how their students depend on their actions they make previously, to see how it can change the lives and future of the students. Please acknowledge this. And now, they are openly and deliberately indiscriminating against boys and young men even from vocational trade schools and openly turning them away from learning and hands on career workshops WHICH IS AN OUTRIGHT ACT OF INDISCRIMINATION AGAINST BOYS AND MEN AND WHICH SHOULD BE REPORTED TO THE SCHOOL AUTHORITIES WHO ARE UNFORTUNATELY INDISCRIMINATING ALSO AGAINST BOYS AND MEN AND TURNING THEM AWAY FROM ALL SOURCES OF LEARNING THAT BOYS AND MEN MUST NOW RESORT IN FORMING THEIR OWN INDEPENDENT BOYS-MEN LEARNING CLUBS TO FORM THEIR OWN PRIVATE learning and hands on career workshops and career events featuring mechanics and welding learning vocational school clubs. IF THEY INDISCRIMINATE AGAINST BOYS AND MEN, THEN BOYS AND MEN HAS THE RIGHT TO DEFEND THEMSELVES AGAINST ALL FORMS OF ANTI-MALE \textbf{GENDER} INDISCRIMINATION BY USING ALL DEENSIVE METHODS AND COUNTER-OFFENSIVE POLICIES IN ALL PLACES OF WORK AND STUDY AND THAT IS THEIR RIGHTS TO FIGHT BACK AGAINST THESE BRAINWASHED WOMEN-FEMINAZISTS AND RADICAL FEMINISTS EXTREMISTS! And more than that, men are the ones who created civilizations, expanded their borders, administered their empires, send armies of explorers and patrols and outposts stations along the roads they created, to do this they created writing, mathematics, science, governmental organizational administrative structures, tamed the wilderness, send rotating patrols to guard the frontiers and the lands and rivers and seas under their dominions and all these requires logistical knowledge, the creation of military tactics and strategies, engineering knowledge was developed for the need to build fortifications and public works and irrigation networks and water networks and sewage networks, metallurgical knowledge was created for better farm implements and weapons and fortifications, and many others too many to mention here and ALL OF THESE WERE CREATED AND INVENTED AND EXPOUNDED UPON AND IMPROVED UPON BY MEN. From the brains of these men are born the greatest civilizations of the world like Sumeria, Babylon, Persia, Ebla, Troy, Greece, Rome, Parthia, the Chinese Dynasties, the Empire of Japan. It is only when the world at the start of the 1900 has been thoroughly explored, mapped, tamed, outpost constructed, and professional men rotated on their duties based on the calendars and time keeping technologies they have developed to help administer the world that women now has time enough to devote time to their studies that their i.q started to slowly rise because of all the intelligent works of men THAT TAMED AND CIVILIZED THE WORLD FOR THEM WHICH MEANS THE USE OF UNLIMITED MALE BRAIN POWER TO CREATE ALL OF THAT! And then they have the time to create their women's movements in the 20th century which was hijacked by the NWO who wanted to destroy the family by destroying the men gradually through the use of the unspoken and unwritten policy of equality through inequality against the men and at the expense of men until the 80s and 90s that schools run by biased radicalized liberals extremists are deliberately neglecting the needs of boys and men in education and unfairly pouring more resources to meet the needs of girls and women at the expense of boys and men, instead of equalizing the sharing of resources they are unfairly diverting more resources to the females at the expense of the males which can be explained in the book "The War Against Boys" and they are doing it in the name of equality through inequality when in fact anyone who is unbiased can see that they are doing it in the name of inequality at the expense of the boys and men's academic educational needs. All these things started with co-education in order to destroy the established educational systems patterned and based after the male thinking patterns and attitudes toward education and then applying the female systems on the males which caused a lot of havoc in the form of higher drop outs and academic discouragements and academic hardships. For it is like trying to fit a circle in a square which creates empty gaps of spaces and those empty gaps of spaces are the deliberately created academic gaps and vacuums created to deliberately make the education of the boys and men incomplete and completely sabotaged. We former KGB-GRU/FSB officers saw all of these happening and recorded it and sent reports to Moscow. We could have made it public to the American public to the parents of these boys and men but we did not because of the Cold War. Anything that can be used as a weapon will be used as a weapon. In fact, we inserted ourselves in the NWO's agencies and foundations to plant seeds of destructive policies but in a very subtle and indirect way so as to make the NWO that they are the ones who created these policies even though it is us who created these policies in the first place.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender, Yellow & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Asian (East- China, Japan, Korea, Philippines, Vietnam), Gender - General, Nationality - Chinese, Nationality - Japanese & \cellcolor{green!5}4/1506 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.266 \\  \hline

And how did they openly made changes to disadvantage boys in order to unfairly give all the advantage to girls which is \textbf{GENDER} INDISCRIMINATION IN ACTION AGAINST BOYS?\&160; Could you explain it to me in it\&39;s complete entierty, detail by detail, like creating a blue print of the nefarious plans?\&160; And the men who work in education who are too frightened to openly argue this \textbf{gender} indiscrimination against boys because they might lose promotion prospects, could they also help in giving me the details on how these very destructive sexist anti-male \textbf{gender} feminazis are doing it?\&160; And my advice to for you to write a highly detailed book about it with physical evidences in the form of documents, curriculum plans, textbook changes compared to past textbooks in the 80s and 70s and 60s and add also the information by these men who are also working in education. And my advice is, why not at the same time, create in secret a parallel curriculum and textbooks by using the curriculum and textbooks of the past early 80s, and 70s, and 60s, and 50s, and 40s. The reason why I want to know and help you is because I was once a former officer of the Cold War of which I dare not mention too much and I have seen and notice a lot too. But since I am already retired and too \textbf{old} to travel I can only offer advice: Create in secret a parallel curriculum and textbooks using the past curriculum and textbooks of the past decades as mentioned above, especially the 60s and 50s and 40s and 30s and upgrade them if necessary without making almost any changes at all so as not to lose the gist of their lessons. And make duplicate copies of them and hide them in a safe place. Then use a tactic called flanking movement wherein you will introduce just one set of copy through a second party in an another school where logic and sanity still prevail. Make sure that the school is safe enough to introduce them, and are run by sane men and women who knows what is really is going on which is MALE \textbf{GENDER} INDISCRIMINATION AGAINST BOYS AND YOUNG MEN IN EDUCATION. You can contact me through youtube provided youtube does not censor your messages for youtube seems to be under the control,of self-hating feminized men and by feminazis. And what would you do to stop and reversed the feminized education in the U.K? How would you do it? How about creating a blue print, a kind of battle plan against this UNFAIRNESS AND INDISCRIMINATION AGAINST BOYS AND YOUNG MEN IN U.K EDUCATION IN ALL LEVELS. How to re-engineer the educational system in favor of boys need and young mens needs without indiscriminating against the females who were unfairly given more attention to their needs while neglecting the needs of the males who needs equal attention also.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}5/530 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.943 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Steve M 3 weeks ago (edited) Projects were introduced which incorporated more English expression skills. The short comprehension questions in exams, (requiring numerical answers), were changed to short paragraph English expression questions. To summarise, feminists in education worked hard to change the Physics curriculum to ensure that girls benefited. Feminists in education openly made changes to disadvantage boys and advantage girls. Men who work in education are too frightened to explain this or argue against it otherwise they may lose promotion prospects.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Yeah, right. It doesn't matter what \textbf{sex} you are, it matters how hard you try, and what type of education you get. This so-called "Battle of the sexes" is stupid. We should all be equal.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Sex & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/35 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.857 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Durr, when a \textbf{woman} makes 75 cents to a mans \$1.00, it's impossible to make more than him in the same job. BUT, DarthSchwartz, I'm sure there are TONS' of women who earn more than you do. May the schwartz be with you!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/43 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.326 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small lol men are superiur to women in physical strength and if the page gap exists in certain jobs that require manual labor then its rigthfully exists.If a \textbf{woman} could do as good as a job for ex. in the construction field then she should be paid the same as her male co-worker.Now in the office field i have the impression men are doing a lot better at higer tiers i dont know if this is entirely true but i sure have seen more male managers than female managers a lot more.if the pay isnt the same in this field then a reseasrch needs to be made to conclude if males are working harder or women or its equial.Now surely women do better in ceratin jobs but men do better in a wider spectrum of jobs than women and this why male unemployement rate wordwide must be lower than female i pressume.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/151 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.662 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Women earn 75 cents to a man's \$1.00. That is why they make more, not because we don't want money, \textbf{pigs} just don't find us as valuable.... or at least don't want us to be as valuable.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}PIGS & \cellcolor{green!5}Nationality - Southern European & \cellcolor{green!5}1/37 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.703 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Well, women do have better memory than men, but most conventional IQ results I've seen up until now show that the average \textbf{woman} scores 1-2 points less on those tests than the average man does. As \@DarthSchwatz pointed out below, men make considerably more money than women do, and I suspect that it's mostly because the average \textbf{woman} finds profit less alluring.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/62 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.226 \\  \hline
