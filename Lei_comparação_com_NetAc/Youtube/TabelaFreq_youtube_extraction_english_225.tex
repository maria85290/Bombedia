Did they beg for extra rights and benefits?  No.  The Chinese got on with progressing and earning their way around the obstacles put in their path.  They worked harder and taught their children to succeed.  They educated them to fit into mainstream society.  There is \textbf{nothing} to stop any Aboriginal from succeeding like other races here today.  Please don't buy into the hype and political correctness.  Giving one \textbf{race} more rights means setting up an apartheid type state.

You see them delivering bread, food etc at 0400hrs in the morning, manning the 7/11 stores and cleaning shops etc  Aboriginals can certainly do the same.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Xzyel About 8000 b.c.e. the first grinding stone, called a quern, was invented in Egypt, and the first grain was crushed. The modern \textbf{Indian} chapatis, made from unleavened whole wheat flour, and Mexican tortillas, made from corn, resemble the breads produced at that time. Between 5000 and 3700 b.c.e. Egypt began organized grain production along the Nile River Valley. At this time bread became a staple food that often was used in trade and barter, and it began to migrate to other cultures.About 3000 b.c.e., also in Egypt, varieties of wheat that were tougher, that is, more tolerant of weather and environment, were developed. It is widely thought that, owing to the Egyptian skill with brewing beer and the warm climate, wild yeasts attracted to the flour mixtures created the first sourdough. Recognizing the fermentation process, bakers began to experiment and developed the first purposefully leavened breads. By about 2500 b.c.e. the first true sourdoughs were in regular production in the Middle East and Mediterranean regions.In about 2300 b.c.e. the cultivation of grain began in India along the Indus Valley. Around 1500 b.c.e. horses took over the task of plowing and the first iron plowshares were introduced. In about 1000 b.c.e. yeasted breads became popular in Rome. The circular quern, the basis for milling until the Industrial Revolution and the basis for so-called stone-ground flours in the twenty-first century, was developed by about 500 b.c.e. The water mill was invented in Greece around 450 b.c.e. Consequently culinary historians credit the Greeks with ushering in bread baking as an art form.In Rome the first bakers guilds were formed as a means of unifying the craftspeople around 150 b.c.e. Well-to-do Romans insisted on the more exclusive and expensive white breads. Darker whole wheat and bran breads were for the masses, an attitude that persisted well into the twentieth century in Europe and North America. By about 100 c.e. Mexican natives made the first stone-ground corn tortillas. By 300 c.e. the Greeks had developed more than seventy different types of bread, showing their penchant for furthering the bread baking craft. Around 600 c.e. the Persians developed a windmill prototype that changed the face of bread production.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Indian & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Native-American & \cellcolor{green!27}1/366 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.273 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Ray Aboriginals made their own type of bread which they made out of flour from a type of stopped grain that only grew in the Australian climate, recent archaeology findings found a grinding stone in Warrnambool, Arnhem Land that dates back 80 thousand years and in fact their are lot of grindstones found around Australia dating back 65 thousand years, In Western NSW another finding of bread that was 65 thousand years \textbf{old}, Just because it was made somewhere else doesn't mean aboriginals or anyone else couldn't have made it themselves, All of this has been happening for tens thousand of years unnoticed by the rest of the world, a lot of people think Aboriginal were nomadic too which is incorrect.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}1/121 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.826 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Ray Yes there is written documents from the first European explorers stating that there was vast areas of farm lands such as tubers and grain that the aboriginal would grow in straight fields for efficient harvesting and would store and trade with other tribes. The recipes is very basic in that the grain would be smashed in to flour and cooking on the fire, this was also copied by Europeans who travelled inland. Aboriginals still to this very day make the bread and it's really \textbf{common} because how easy and much you can make of it, in Australia we call it 'Damper' and Aboriginals actually use a special type of wood called 'red wood' that they use to cook. In 2017 archaeologist found a axe head grindstone in Kakadu national park that carbon dates back to 65,000 years. The location of Australia and the dreamtime really played a big part on the advancement of Aboriginals.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Common & \cellcolor{green!27}Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}1/155 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.645 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Xzyel Yes but despite the evidence of the existence of some villages in certain areas, much of Aboriginal society was still hunter gatherer.  "Aboriginal Australianwere limited to the range of foods occurring naturally in their area, but they knew exactly when, where and how to find everything edible. Anthropologists and nutrition experts who have studied the tribal diet in Arnhem Land found it to be well-balanced, with most of the nutrients modern dietitians recommend. But food was not obtained without effort. In some areas both men and women had to spend from half to two-thirds of each day hunting or foraging for food. Each day, the women of the group went into successive parts of one countryside with wooden digging sticks and plaited dilly bags or wooden coolamons. Larger animals and birds, such as kangaroos and emus, were speared or \textbf{disabled} with a thrown club, boomerang, or stone. Many Indigenous hunting devices were used to get within striking distance of prey. The men were excellent trackers and stalkers, approaching their prey running where there was cover, or 'freezing' and crawling when in the open. They were careful to stay downwind and sometimes covered themselves with mud to disguise their smell. "  They were comparable to Neolithic societies elsewhere.In some areas mainland Aboriginal Australians also lived in semi-permanent villages, most usually in less arid areas where fishing could provide for a more settled existence. Most Indigenous communities were semi-nomadic, moving in a regular cycle over a defined territory, following seasonal food sources and returning to the same places at the same time each year. From the examination of middens, archaeologists have shown that some localities were visited annually by Indigenous communities for thousands of years. In the more arid areas Aboriginal Australians were nomadic, ranging over wide areas in search of scarce food resources. There is evidence of substantial change in indigenous culture over time.Also, the written evidence was from European settlers.  Aboriginals in Australia failed to develop a written language and progress\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Disabled & \cellcolor{green!5}Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}1/334 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.299 \\  \hline

How are cave paintings not art? They are older than any European art and even have spiritual meaning and valuable insight to the ancient world, you think just because it's not in a frame there for it's not art is very ignorant, I never claim Aboriginal Australia was an Empire it was actually a bunch of Nations.

A donkey definitely is valued and has its uses but it will never win races.  Fiction ain't fact.  Cave art is certainly "art" but like I said, even Neanderthal and Cro Magnon man had cave art so a Mona Lisa it ain't.  Great civilizations had written languages and a means of transferring their thoughts, beliefs and practices to the next generation and beyond.  Aboriginals lacked that.  Furthermore your "bunch of Nations" then lost the war.  To the victor the spoils.  Worse still, after having lost, they weren't able to bounce back and learn from their deficiencies.  Throughout time, nations were conquered, and conquered others but they recovered, learned and rose again.   Like I pointed out, what you described happened to a certain extent but they weren't able to build on that .

The European Australians aren't victors their just thief's and immigrants and Aboriginals legally own 40 of the land in modern day Australia and they number will just increase with time, It's hard to bounce back in a country that for most of its modern history didn't want them to and stopped them at every turn and even actively tried to destroy them but destroying their culture and languages and bloodline. And as I said before the dreamtime had a VERY big importance to Aboriginals this is why they didn't build big cities and destroy the land like the Europeans did it's not in our culture and beliefs to do that but yet you just act as if that wasn't a factor at all, I'm not rewriting history but merely telling the true history that the \textbf{racist} government of Australia tried to destroy and keep hidden,  like a kid you get fed the lies and you love eating it, I would love to see how Islamic Europe will be in 20 years' time.

Yet the gulf between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians is set to widen further.The minister for Education, Senator Amanda Vanstone is already foreshadowing a slashing of Education expenditure with greater financial responsibility falling on students and their parents.

A lot of this money is pay back money for what the Australian government did to the Aboriginals and I think it fairly justified, just like how Germany pays back all the countries it went to war with, Australia pays Aboriginals for all the destruction it caused. Abstudy is trying to educate more and more Aboriginals and rise the education level of Australia as a whole and being more educated increases the chance of getting a job, What do you hate about that? Here is a true fact for you there are more white people living on tax payer's money than Aboriginals.Australia has a highly targeted social security system with support based on family and individual circumstances. The Productivity Commission estimates that 68.5 of the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous expenditure is 'because of greater need, and because of the younger \textbf{age} profile of the population.'Most people below the poverty line in Australia (53) rely on social security as their main source of income, but most major income support payments sit well below the poverty line.The Commonwealth, state and territory governments spent almost \$160 billion on welfare in 2015-16, according to a new report.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Racism & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/252 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.794 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Xzyel Don't accuse people who want equality of \textbf{racism}.  Aboriginals like you are the racists.  You demand MORE for one \textbf{race} than ALL the other races in Australia.  You work but your children still get MORE than everyone else and yes me, my children and my grandchildren are forced to PAY through our taxes for YOU.  That is \textbf{racism}.  I and mine have to work harder and get less because of it so don't claim to have a wonderful culture when you are a beggar.Aboriginal unemployment stands at 20.6.  Lazy sods.  This is way above the 5.6 national unemployment.  Getting employment means MORE than just waiting for others to come knocking at your door.  It means getting qualified (without special treatment) like everyone else.  It means waking up every morning to crawl to work.  It means actually working productively.  That's right.  Some Aboriginals work BUT many are a burden.Now, instead of helping ALL Australians, of every \textbf{ethnicity} who fail to make the grade to reach that entry bar into choice courses in higher learning, they instead lowered the entry standards for Aboriginals.  This means that a less capable, less hard working, perhaps less intelligent person got into a course instead of the very best.  That is not a good thing.  We could have Aboriginal doctors/nurses who are less than the very best providing a crucial service.  Furthermore, many enrol in Indigenous studies/Aboriginal studies.  Will multi national companies want to employ people who are good in oh say \textbf{dot} painting or learning to speak a language/dialect which has no international commercial use instead of accountants, commerce/business, engineering, mining, mathematics graduates?  No.  So tax payer money is once again thrown at Aboriginals creating imaginary jobs for them. ONLY Aboriginals can be employed as Aboriginal Liaison Officers.  What about Scottish, \textbf{Indian}, Chinese liaison officers?  In Australia, there is also a phrase "Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders are encouraged to apply".  It often means that entry requirements are lowered to get Aboriginals into employment.  The best person should get the job irrespective of \textbf{ethnicity}, \textbf{race} or \textbf{sex}.  That is not a good thing.  Life is hard and getting harder.  We should ALL be treated EQUALLY irrespective of \textbf{ethnicity}/\textbf{race}/skin colour and may the BEST man or \textbf{woman} win.

This is my opinion about this whole \textbf{racist} comments thing that's going on here, being a white European man myself.Don't forget that pretty much all white people originate from the Europeans, and for which it could have been your own family ancestors who did these things... Pretty hypocritical if you blame the Europeans for this now. I think, the reason why they did these horrible things ( I think) all descendants feel ashamed and guilty about, is all about power. Because mankind has a brutal lust for power. If you look at the way the world developed during it's history, you can see that Europe was the most developed part of the earths population. If they would go out exploring to other parts of the earth, where they are not as developed as you were, then the people rightfully living there are very vulnerable. Men seeking fortune and power probably saw this as an easy way of getting that.Mankind has always wanted to explore the world, or the unknown. That could be a big reason why they went and explored the world. I'm not trying to say what the colonizers, like: Britain, France, Germany and The Netherlands did was okay, and that it should have been this way... But this made them the most powerful part of the world for a very long time...Even now, the Americans (which are also Europeans) still have a huge influence on how the world turns. I think what we need to do is look to the past with an understanding of the mistakes we've made,  and do it better while we get our short time on this earth. Let's learn from our mistakes, and not let them happen again. I think that this doesn't mean that the men who live here now need to be punished for the stupid leaders of the past.

Crime is a significant social issue in Alice Springs. Alice Springs has the highest crime rate of any Australian city, with raw crime numbers higher than Darwin, a city with three times the population and a record of high crime. Violent crime in the town in 2010 was at unprecedented levels and "out of control". Alice Springs is the nation's murder capital and one of the most dangerous towns in Australia The level of crime has had a major impact on the town's tourist industry with tourists from several countries being warned to avoid the town or take extra precautions. Most violent crime in Alice Springs is between Aboriginal people too.  Now no doubt you've heard of ATSIC, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission.  They voted their leaders in, ran programs paid for by Australian tax payers and then ran it into the ground with a good dose of gang rapes, fraud and embezzlement thrown in  until it was dismantled.  In 2016, Indigenous Australians were still nearly 13 times more likely to be unemployed (at a rate of 33.3) than non-Indigenous Australians (2.6).

I and mine have to work harder and get less because of it so don't claim to have a wonderful culture when you are a beggar.Aboriginal unemployment stands at 20.6.  Lazy sods.  This is way above the 5.6 national unemployment.  Getting employment means MORE than just waiting for others to come knocking at your door.  It means getting qualified (without special treatment) like everyone else.  It means waking up every morning to crawl to work.  It means actually working productively.  That's right.  Some Aboriginals work BUT many are a burden.Now, instead of helping ALL Australians, of every \textbf{ethnicity} who fail to make the grade to reach that entry bar into choice courses in higher learning, they instead lowered the entry standards for Aboriginals.  This means that a less capable, less hard working, perhaps less intelligent person got into a course instead of the very best.  That is not a good thing.  We could have Aboriginal doctors/nurses who are less than the very best providing a crucial service.  Furthermore, many enrol in Indigenous studies/Aboriginal studies.  Will multi national companies want to employ people who are good in oh say \textbf{dot} painting or learning to speak a language/dialect which has no international commercial use instead of accountants, commerce/business, engineering, mining, mathematics graduates?  No.  So tax payer money is once again thrown at Aboriginals creating imaginary jobs for them. ONLY Aboriginals can be employed as Aboriginal Liaison Officers.  What about Scottish, \textbf{Indian}, Chinese liaison officers?  In Australia, there is also a phrase "Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders are encouraged to apply".  It often means that entry requirements are lowered to get Aboriginals into employment.  The best person should get the job irrespective of \textbf{ethnicity}, \textbf{race} or \textbf{sex}.  That is not a good thing.  Life is hard and getting harder.  We should ALL be treated EQUALLY irrespective of \textbf{ethnicity}/\textbf{race}/skin colour and may the BEST man or \textbf{woman} win.

Aboriginals who get into courses on lower marks, get into jobs on lower qualifications and have jobs actually created for them do you a disservice.  I tell my children to work hard to achieve what they want in life, to sometimes sacrifice fun today in order to improve their lives tomorrow.  Now I have to tell them that no matter how much they accomplish, someone else, an Aboriginal will get into the course on lower marks, get the job just because of their \textbf{race}/ethnicity/skin colour (eg ticking the Are you Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander is not simply for statistical purposes) and even have a job created specifically for them eg Aboriginal Liaison Officer, Westpac/Woolworths Indiegenous Employment Program etc simply because of \textbf{race}.  My children will lose out to someone with lower marks, less/lower/perhaps no qualifications, less dedication, less individual intelligence.  That is not a good thing both for the individual and for society as a whole. Aboriginals also get way more in terms of Austudy (for all Australians) v Abstudy (ONLY for Aboriginals).  Much of what Aboriginals get in Abstudy are in the form of grants which do not have to be paid back.  Furthermore, Abstudy also funds Aboriginals for their masters and doctrate degrees.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Sienna Sticher ... I have done some research for you. Scientific and historical factsThe first Homo sapiens who lived in Australia walked from the north about 50,000 years ago - because there was land to walk on. The first human migration to Australia was achieved when this landmass formed part of the Sahul continent, connected to the island of New \textbf{Guinea} via a land bridge. Over time these land bridges were covered by ocean due to normal tectonic plate movement and rising sea levels. Hence the Homo sapiens who inhabited the continent of Australia about 40,000-50,000 years ago (the ancestors of current Australian aborigines) became cut off from the Homo sapiens on the other parts of the planet. After they were cut-off, the human tribes in Australia fought each other and many tribes slaughtered the males of other tribes. The Australian aboriginals were particularly bloodthirsty and cruel. The normal process of inter-tribal fighting means that males are usually killed while females are kept alive to bear the children of the victorious tribe.The humans who occupied the rest of the planet had similar inter-tribal warfare but there was a much greater variety of humans who were competing with each other. On the large continents, humans evolved and changed due to a great deal of natural competition. Stronger more intelligent human groups resulted. Over many thousands of years the successful groups dominated and incorporated their genes with other stronger groups. This is a simplification of course but it explains observations.Humans across the planet (except for those in Australia and other inaccessible locations), they developed agriculture and better tools and instruments. This caused them to flourish. As their numbers increased, diseases evolved which killed many of these humans. The survivors had more active immune systems as well as better skills in cognitive thought. Humans became better at living co-operatively.   * * *If Australia had NOT been cut off by the ocean, stronger, more intelligent humans would have dominated and killed the males of the Australian tribes. They would have assimilated some of the genes from the females many thousands of years ago. The overall result is that mainstream humans with a higher intelligence and stronger immune systems spread across the planet, except for places which were inaccessible, such as Australia. The humans in Australia remained stone-\textbf{age} tribes who had not yet invented the wheel. On a scale where the average European human has an IQ of 100, the natives of Australia have an IQ of about 64. By the modern Australian standard, the majority of pure aboriginals are well below the medically defined level for \textbf{mental} retardation, thus they qualify for special medical benefits the same as other \textbf{handicapped} people. Recognising that the natives had little organisation and had developed only simple stone tools, the British colonists saw Australia as unoccupied. When the British arrived to colonise Australia in 1788 they carried with them diseases which the stone-\textbf{age} Australian aboriginal immune system was not adapted to. The settlers would have been unaware of this. Viruses and bacteria were not known about at that time. Human hosts would have been completely unaware they were carrying diseases dangerous to Australian natives. The British settlers were soon followed by others from Europe and Asia bringing with them varieties of bacteria and viruses that the Australian aboriginals had not contracted before. This was the main cause of ‘aboriginal' death. An aboriginal living in those early days needed to stay well away from the settlers and some settlers helped to facilitate this.There were hundreds of tribes and about 250 different primitive languages. The tribes were very bloodthirsty towards each other. Some may have been killed by settlers in self-defence but killing aborigines was illegal and called murder by British law.Most of the full aboriginals died after colonisation because the humans who came to Australia unknowingly brought in diseases, such as bubonic plague, chickenpox, hepatitis, tetanus, cholera, the \textbf{common} cold, diphtheria, influenza, malaria, measles, scarlet fever, sexually transmitted diseases, polio, typhoid, typhus, tuberculosis, and pertussis (whooping cough), etc.The only reason any full aboriginals are alive and healthy is because of white people developed antibiotics and vaccines. White people have been looking after the full aboriginals in their remote settlements. * * *Humans reached Tasmania approximately 40,000 years ago by migrating across a land bridge from the mainland that existed during the last ice \textbf{age}. After the seas rose about 12,000 years ago and covered the land bridge, the inhabitants there were isolated from the mainland until the arrival of European settlers. The settler's history is particularly well detailed by historic documents. The death of these aboriginals due to disease is particularly well described. The European settlers tried to isolate them to protect them from diseases. There is NO evidence of mass killings or genocide.* * *After colonisation, many of the Australian aboriginals who survived the diseases mixed their genes with the colonists and many ‘mixed \textbf{race}' humans have resulted. They are still called ‘aboriginals'.There are a small number of ‘pure' aboriginals still in existence in the warmer parts of Australia. They are generally quiet and prefer to live in remote, isolated locations. They are cared for and survive because of the health care system in place to look after them. Antibiotics have had an important role.The large amount of government funding assigned to aboriginal healthcare allows the mixed \textbf{race} aboriginals to thrive. The average mixed \textbf{race} aboriginal female has more than 6 children. As expected there are major problems with drug abuse and child \textbf{sexual} abuse. Most do not have the skills to be gainfully employed so most have very little to do and they suffer from boredom.There are many mixed-\textbf{race} aboriginals who are termed ‘aboriginals'. The more vocal and assertive of them tend to have characteristics of Europeans and have a family tree that is mostly European. Some of these mixed-\textbf{race} aboriginals become ‘aboriginal activists' who try to propagate the idea that ‘invading whites' have taken over their country. For example, an aboriginal documentary video on YouTube has written comments such as: 'Our blood is mixed with many who have sought our Land, and our shade of skin is varied, but our hearts will always be true.' The writer of this sentence is part aboriginal but is mostly of European or Asian in background. The writer wants to claim that Australia is his/her land. This is taken seriously by the media even though the family tree of the ‘aboriginal activists' demonstrates that the activists themselves are ‘invading whites' -- the very group that they profess to be subjugated by. Some ‘aboriginals' even have blue eyes.The leftist media supports the false victim mentality of aboriginals and propagates a myth of poor colonist treatment of aboriginals. The elite, globalist, Jewish billionaires who own the mainstream media, instruct journalists and editors to do this. They want to discredit white national identity as much as they can. People shouldn't be fooled by this. Migrants come to live in a white-built country for a reason. Elite Jews want to spread propaganda that white countries are somehow 'illegal' or 'illegitimate' -- this is to allow their globalist takeover to take place more easily. Bringing in hoards of foreigners (Islamists from the Middle East and Africa) who hate Australia is part of the globalist agenda.The globalist agenda has been explained in two videos, titled:  What Is a Globalist? and The Globalist Agenda Explained.‘Aboriginal' activists exaggerate for political reasons – to gain more government funding and special treatment.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Common, Guinea, Handicapped, Mental, Race, Sexual & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General, Nationality - Italian, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}8/1258 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.636 \\  \hline

For example, you wouldn't expect your competitor to have a shorter distance to run or win if his/her time was worse than yours in the same sprint distance.  Now that is what is happening with regard to Aboriginals today.  Aboriginals get into university on lower marks, get a job with lower/less qualifications than you and if all else fails , the government will create special well paying jobs ONLY for Aboriginals eg Aboriginal Liaison Officer, Indigenous Rangers etc.  All of us, irrespective of \textbf{race}/ethnicity deserve EQUAL treatment.

I am amazed that the origins of man can be such a divisive subject , based on sheer ignorance and racial discrimination. Aboriginal people are much maligned even in our own country. The conditions many of our  (remote) people live in is absolutely deplorable, and an outsider is easily mislead looking at face value. Even though i am a product of the welfare era , notorious for the forced removal of children, ( the stolen generation),  I am proud to be a descendant of the oldest most complex people to have ever walked this planet .

Or yu can read up on the early aussie explorers, and see how they fared without local aboriginal knowledge of the land.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The irony of white people telling the story of another people whom they stole their land from. How about you let them tell the story of how they were conquered by you \textbf{whitey}. By the way, the Aborigines are from one of the twelve tribes of Israel. They're from the tribe of Reuben, whom their father Jacob told would not excel because he laid with his father's concubine, Bilha. This is why Aboriginals cannot advance in any aspects of life. Their father Jacob cursed them to be this way. And it hasn't been no 50,000 years.Genesis 49:3-4"3 Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:4 Unstable as water, THOU SHALT NOT EXCEL; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch."\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Whitey & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - White & \cellcolor{green!5}1/147 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.68 \\  \hline
