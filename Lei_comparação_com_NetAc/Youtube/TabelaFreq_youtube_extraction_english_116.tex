\hline\cellcolor{green!27}\small I used to work at this one place where hardly anybody was over the \textbf{age} of 28. Reaching \textbf{age} 30 was like a death sentence. My \textbf{old} boss, who lost hearing on one of his ears due to childhood fever, wouldn't dare to wear a hearing aid because he was already 40 and pressure was mounting against him.During the meetings, all of my ideas and inputs went totally ignored, until younger associates just repeated what I had just said and were congratulated by the group.When that started happening all the time, I decided to leave them and take my 'brilliant ideas' to their competitor. Luckily, my new workplace values actual diversity of \textbf{race}, religion, body types, \textbf{age}, thinking, etc.My \textbf{old} workplace just pretended that they're diverse â€” in early 2010s they finally started to use nonwhite models in ads, and now they even claim to support diversity. BUT only if you're below \textbf{age} 26, tall, \textbf{skinny}, and Q2 personality type. (Yes, I had to take a training course on how everybody there is only Q2.)Thank goodness I left them.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Old, Race, Skinny & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - General, Physical Identity - Physical Features & \cellcolor{green!27}8/183 & \cellcolor{green!27}4.372 \\  \hline

They discriminate against \textbf{old} people, against white people, against women, against very young people, against anybody who is not like them.  That's \textbf{racism} at its worst.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small this is so real I am out of work now, 55 and after 45 I was out of work for 4 years! that was spoken about at work one day as I experienced others in the same boat, that it was "supposed to happen"  4 5 years out of the job market does two things, 1 - it makes you desperate, and you will take a lower paying job just to eat, 2 lets the job market weed out the less qualified. but it does so mu harm to you, In my state,  as a white \textbf{woman} who owned a house and a car I was told to let my house go into foreclosure and sell my can and they would help me with Medicaid  - how does that help??? the governments are the purveyors of \textbf{ageism} of us all\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Ageism, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/140 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.429 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small That mention of public policies that should be good for all, made me think of my 80 year \textbf{old} mom who couldn't get into public housing because they gave first consideration to people with kids....even if those people weren't citizens.  THAT pisses me off no emd.!  We have American citizens who are   \textbf{elderly} ..  veterans .. down  on their luck  ... Citizens that are pushed aside for something that should be theirs FIRST simply because someone is here with children?  No, I'm not that caring about the children of other countries when we have children here that are impacted by the hardships placed on our other citizens.  Take your damn kids and go back to your home country.  Figure out how to make your country better and stop milking mine.  Of course part of the problem are the bleeding heart liberals that live in a bubble.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small How about this?  Let's put a proposal on a ballot in one of these states to initiate the concept from the movie Logan's Run.  When someone grows above the \textbf{age} 35, just take the man or \textbf{woman} out and put them out of their so called misery.  I am being sarcastic and not serious but I just want to put that in case someone takes my post too seriously.  \textbf{Age} discrimination kind of feels like the professional and business worlds version of Logan's Run.  It's wrong and just because someone gets to a magical \textbf{age} they are retired and put out to pasture.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}4/103 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.883 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Ageism is disgusting. One would think that wisdom can come with \textbf{age}. Rejecting, not 'disrespecting' someone of a job because of \textbf{age}?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I wouldn't let the fact that he's older bother him to the point of being emotional. There's \textbf{nothing} anyone can do about aging. If you've got valuable skills it's good to market them in the best way to put you in a role that will balance your lifestyle, and work ethics. I realize I might not be in my direct field of work, but I know something more mature, and not too stressful will do just fine.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}1/77 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.299 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The problem is young people are calling themselves \textbf{old} at 30. This is the mentality that is driving people to spend more time focused on what your \textbf{age} is over your production, or value to a business. Some older people are a lot more beneficial to a business than someone young that might leave or has a lot of time to move on in life.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}2/65 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.077 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Another thing. \textbf{Sexual} assault isn't taken as seriously once you're over the \textbf{age} of 18.I understand that there are more legal charges with child rapists as it's another illegal action added, but let's pretend paedophilia isn't illegal. Assault is assault \& it affects everyone just as badly no matter the \textbf{age}. So it should be taken as seriously instead of just fannying around. Even other people who aren't police don't take you seriously when you're 18+ because "you might be lying".\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Sexual & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/82 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.659 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Thank you for posting this. While underage sexuall assault is important, I also believe that \textbf{sexual} assault is just as damaging  at any \textbf{age} and should be paid attention to no matter what \textbf{age}!

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small There are younger people who know the value of \textbf{age} because we have been exposed to it and know that we will be older soon. But? The rest have not been exposed to death and \textbf{age}. They are scared shitless about their future. I think the key to bridging a gap between the \textbf{old} and young requires flexibility and better communication on both sides. Me? I'm doing it from the inside and I'm loud about it. I want this to be a normal way of thinking and doing. I have no problems with hiring young and older people who are flexible and can blend into the work culture. If you want less of this bullshit, put your money and influence into this. I keep hearing older people talk about the youth...the future but they don't talk about the progress of their peers. Your peers are still the future too. They are growing, learning and getting better. We need more immersive programs in adapting to new technology. Keeping up with new skills courses. Scholarships for people over 50 who want to continue their education(when i have more money and influence I will do this. Actual? I will set up a small scholarship asap to get me going). Conferences/organizations that tackle this problem. Lastly, for those younger people who don't care about this? Let me appeal to your selfish side. One day you will be in this same position bitching about \textbf{ageism} and waiting for acceptance. Think of this as planting seeds for self preservation. See to it that you have a seat when that time comes.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Ageism, Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}4/265 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.509 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Not especially towards \textbf{old} people it's actually the complete opposite. Men and women in their twenties get called "kids" all the time, and are treated unfairly all the time. \textbf{Ageism} isn't directed only towards \textbf{old} people it is for young people as well.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Ageism, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}3/43 & \cellcolor{green!5}6.977 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I won't be a victim to these self entitled creeps and their attitudes to older people. I'm opening a business soon and I am only hiring people of my \textbf{age} and I shall be using the same tactics that just about every company in every country currently uses only this time to my advantage.I have suffered \textbf{ageism} for the past 5 years. Now it's my turn.Don't try to understand them as they are selfish narrow minded little shits, so now it's just survival of the fittest the rest is bull shit.Fight fire with fire.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Ageism & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/97 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.062 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Horacio Blue Bottle Dude? Think smarter, not bitterness dipped in exclusivity. Have blended teams within your "business". Building a business out of revenge is foolish. Change the way of thinking from the inside so that you can prosper better. Only hire like minded people who don't care about \textbf{ageism}.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Ageism & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/49 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.041 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small This is what happens when you raise an entire culture day by with with people who are only born within 12 months of each other and tell them "older people are bad". What should we expect? Its getting so bad these people are growing up thinking "They should be neglected and isolated". We need to reconnect communities with everyone in them instead of just "people their own \textbf{age}" or "people from their own neighborhood" or, "people from their grade".\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/79 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.266 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small First Last   \textbf{Age} discrimination is not about \textbf{age}. It's about money.  Older workers are supposedly more expensive.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Don't tell the Democratic Party establishment. They are determined to stop unbought Bernie Sanders from becoming president because he'll change the corrupt status-quo and their main tactic is to use his \textbf{age} against him.

Biden is more than 65.  Obama himself wouldn't fit into any of these so called hip offices since he himself is 50 plus.  I remember watching a movie called Logan's Run from the 1970s of a society that killed people over a certain \textbf{age}.  Logan himself was a police officer who when he aged out had gone on the run with a \textbf{woman} who also aged out and they escaped into the ruins of the ancient civilization.  Their they found a man above the \textbf{age} of 60.   He was active and smart and wasn't senile.

\textbf{\Large Result analysis:}

\begin{itemize}\item Taking into account the words that were detected, we can reach the conclusion these comments are associated with : : Age - General;Age - Over 65s;Ethnicity - General;Physical Identity - Physical Features;Ethnicity - Black;Age - Youngsters;Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments;Gender - General; Ideological and Political Identity - General;%.

\item The percentage of hate speech related words is 3.0066.

\item Considering that the variable \textbf{Age - General} has the most occurences in the post, we can interpret that this is the predominant hate speech.

\item Overall there were 81/55 occurences of hate speech related comments.\end{itemize}\end{document}
