  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The problems of \textbf{racism} in the criminal justice system can still be demed \textbf{racism}, though I am not sure that all of your statistics can be attributed to bias policing or the "system" and may be part of the higher crime rates amoung \textbf{african} americans.  You can not deny that the rates of cime are hight.  Where due to poverty, culture or family or even (and I do not doubt it police).  But there are not Laws on the books concerning \textbf{race}.  The last were in 1965.  What more could you expect from white people.  If they see little \textbf{racism} then for them there in fact is little \textbf{racism}.   All I have an obligation to do is to defend my fellow citizens rights.  And I will do so as long as they defend my rights.  Now as to the so called "white privilage"  please measure that.  How much do I owe because of my skin.  How much abuse should I have to take because of \textbf{black} angre.  What amount do we have to pay to be over this.  Because what it think in my mind. (called say personal bias) or even worst that I unconcieously feel (unconcious bias) is just crap.  You can not use what some people think, or what some people think that they don't even recognise as anything actionable.  You keep \textbf{racism} alive by talking about it over and over.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Racism is not any issue in the U.S, those using it are the racists.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I'd be curious to see the data beyond color relating to crime  sentence.Example. What did the white people who had less of a conviction for the same crime look like? Where they well dressed? Talked educated? Did they have money? Were they influential people?Now, obviously \textbf{racism} does exist, but I like data and solutions. Just saying "\textbf{racism} exisits and here's the proof" isn't doing any good. Need a solution and part of it is finding out why.My assumption is how you dress and talk have more to do with "\textbf{racism}" than your skin color. Not always, but I think in the majority of situations.If a white guy talks poorly and dresses like a thug, he's not getting that job even though he's white. White people make fun of white people who can't talk well or who dress like crap....White people tend to use it as an indicator of education, intelligence, and maturity. That's what white people value.If a \textbf{black} guy talks and dresses well he will actually find himself having a much easier time getting a job than a white guy. \textbf{Racism} is a hot button for white people, which is why it's effective in lazy political debates. As a white kid growing up in the 80's and 90's I was a punk rocker. I wore cut up cloths, patches everywhere, \textbf{weird} \textbf{colored} hair, piercings, and had a "swagger" \textbf{common} for that sub culture. I'd go into a store and be followed by the workers like I was gonna steal something. It wasn't my skin color that made them not trust me, it was how I carried myself, spoke, and dressed.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Colored, Common, Racism, Weird & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}8/277 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.888 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I understand your point but if a \textbf{black} and a white man were to both dress and sound educated, the white man is more likely to be employed. The only difference now is that they don't have an excuse, they can't blame the terrible appearance or low level education. When I was in college me and a friend did an experiment were he (white man) went in a shop first and I looked at the reaction of the security while standing outside and then I went in myself (\textbf{black} man) and I got followed by security as soon as I entered. We were dressed similar and spoke in an educated way yet it didn't stop the discrimination. So regardless, there is discrimination, its just for those that look suspicious then they just make things worse for themselves.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!27}2/137 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.46 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Sometimes I suspect(at least involving white on \textbf{black} \textbf{racism})that the root could be envy.Not that many of we whites would admit to it,of course.In my eyes at least,blacks are much better looking.Also,they \textbf{age} so much better if indeed they \textbf{age} at all.\textbf{Nothing} makes some whites more jealous than effortlessly staying young looking.Besides,there's that resiliency and some quality I can't quite put into words.I guess it has to do with personality mostly.Other peoples seem to lack that intangible "vibe".Mind you,this isn't to kiss \textbf{black} ass.I'd sooner (almost) vote for Trump than kiss ass of any hue.It's all just what I've noticed in my time on this ridiculous planet.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Black, Nothing, Racism & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}6/107 & \cellcolor{green!27}5.607 \\  \hline

I wouldnt say its a \textbf{black} thing to commit higher crimes or not graduate highschool or get paid less... but these things happen because they are usually in poor neighborhoods and in low income places... i dont think we as blacks should blame \textbf{racism} and white people, but we should blame our culture and start proving ourselves wrong, we can do the same as white people in this country, dont blame the system, blame yourselves.

I've read many times that they feel that the color of their skin is noticed first and that they feel immediately stereotyped. Yes I do notice the color of skin. Right away. But I love it. Wow so many beautiful shades of people. It's hard not to stare sometimes. Wow! But no, I don't immediately have a presumption except that I know they have suffered differently than I and I feel sorry. There is one thing that I experience as a white. I've noticed when I walk down the street and if there is a group of \textbf{black} youths on a corner that I feel very uncomfortable. I am self conscience and think they only see my skin color and guess things about me. I want to say hello like I do with any strangers but I'm afraid they don't like me and won't welcome my "hello".I'm not sure because of the different ways in which we have suffered if they will welcome me.As I pass I feel helpless and stupid and sad.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I can't believe you actually said that. The overwhelming majority of \textbf{black} men stopped and searched are not while smoking weed.

What does this show? Not only in NY but around the country \textbf{black} men are targeted over white men, not because they are committing more crime than white men, but because of their \textbf{race}.A study released by the FBI and other crime statics data shows that white males committ the majority of crime in this country. And a more recently released study in march shows that population percentages have \textbf{nothing} to do with rate of crimes committed, it's about all about propensity.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I have issues with what he says. For example if a person steals a candy bar and the store wants to press charges. There would be a court case and hearing with a judge to have the final decision. My point is that judges look at every avenue. They look at the persons history, what they do for a living, their family, how they present themself in court, how respect they are towards the judge and others in the courtroom. A judge could give one person a slap on the wrist for this crime OR throw the book at them and even some cases they can add years onto the sentence. Iv seen it happen. So for this guy to say that \textbf{racism} exist due to the fact that \textbf{black} people have harsher sentences for the same crime, i think is one dimensional. There is so much more detail to look at and analyze rather than stats. A lot goes into why the numbers are the way they are, not just the color of ones skin. Why is over 80 of the NBA \textbf{black}? With this guys reasoning,  he would say well because of the stats, the NBA is \textbf{racist} against white people which isnt true. Ever just think that blaack people may just be better at this sport that white people? Who knows it could be a cultural thing on where basketball came from, who invented it and how it evolved overtime. Same goes with Hockey, why is the NHL over 90 white?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small There were a few points that I take issue with here.\textbf{Black} people may be searched more than white people in certain areas, but that is simply a matter of profiling. The vast majority of gun assailents in NYC are \textbf{black} or Hispanic. I think profiling in cases like this are justified.The resume study seems to be more of a cultural thing than a \textbf{race} thing. If these employers get an application from someone with a rediculous name, they have reason to suspect that the persons parents were at least immature and irresponsible. Thus, They have reason to suspect that the applicant may not have been brought up in the best environment. I think that this study alone does not prove systemic \textbf{racism} in hiring, wspecially with the affirmative action that exists now.It only takes one generation to get out of poverty. It makes sense that inheritance increases the wealth disparity between \textbf{black} and white Americans, but the actual poverty rate in the \textbf{black} community is an entirely different issue. The fact that some white people are inheriting property does not prevent \textbf{black} people from rising up out of poverty. I don't know the specifics of the drug arrest stats, but I think it is reasonable to say that inner cities are much more policed for drugs than suburban and rural areas. This is where most of the gang activity and drug related violence occurs. So is it possible that this disparity is a result of the inner cities being more strictly policed combined with the higher population of \textbf{African} Americans? Just a thought.Finally, did the prison sentencing stats account for previous sentences? People with existing criminal records will get longer sentences for the same crime. If someone could clear that up, that would be great.I am not ruling out the idea of systemic \textbf{racism}, but I think such a claim requires as much context and evidence as possible. I think there needs to be more of an explanation of what is causing these disparities.Edit: The quality of public schools does not prove any \textbf{racism}. People can live where they want to live as long as they can afford it. Inner city public schools are generally very shitty. The wealthier school districts are going to have better public schools. Public education is at fault here.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Joey Flores Yeah, they do deserve to be talked about. You want to blame \textbf{black} people for \textbf{racism} yet you won't blame others like the KKK or this country's justice system for \textbf{racism}. School laws that ban and suspend \textbf{black} kids for their natural hair and \textbf{black} hairstyles they wear. Workplace laws that fire \textbf{black} people for wearing their natural hair because it's not "professional" or it's an "distraction." Being racial profiled, followed in your own apartment because some white \textbf{woman} thinks you don't live there, being called the cops on because a white \textbf{woman} doesnt think you live in this condo and owns this pool because you're \textbf{black}. You would rather blame \textbf{black} people for this than to blame the people doing it. Look at your life. \textbf{Black} Americans have typically been the Klan's primary target, it also has attacked Jews, immigrants, gays and lesbians and, until recently, Catholics. Are you \textbf{black}? If not re-evaluate yourself by "they hate my \textbf{race} too." I don't know your \textbf{race} nor do I care but just because a hate group doesn't bother you doesn't mean it won't bother other groups of people. If that's how you live through life I give condolences to your parents. Probably you don't care nor does it bother you because this HATE group hasn't been the one targeting and killing your \textbf{race} for decades. And even if \textbf{black} people were to stop paying attention to the KKK they would still continue with their hate. As long as \textbf{black} people still live in america, it's a problem to them. I never said \textbf{black} people commit a handful of crimes. I even acknowledged that they even committed the highest crimes in America. Tf? But so a \textbf{race} committing high rates of crimes gives the police a reason to inflict police brutality? A \textbf{black} boy named Jordan who has never committed any crimes in his lifetime gives the police a reason to inflict brutality just because is \textbf{race} commits an high amount of crimes. Don't reply to me saying no because that's exactly what you're insinuating. Let's use your logic then. Because white people have a history of slavery and \textbf{racism} (past and present) in america, they deserve to be discriminated and to be treated poorly. It's basically their fault. Because Mexicans have a numerous amount of cartel gangs, selling drugs, and go around killing civilians in america, they deserve to be deported. It's basically their fault. Is that right? Using your logic that's basically what you're saying. True story: This story is sort of similar to yours. Me and my \textbf{black} family who adopted me was behind a \textbf{black} \textbf{woman} who wanted to pay for a dress she bought for whatever reasons I don't know. The cashier who was a white man denied her from paying and claimed that she couldn't afford it. When the \textbf{woman} asked what he meant by that, the cashier said that she's \textbf{black} and went on a whole rant about \textbf{black} people and how they can't afford things. When the \textbf{woman} called him out for is actions and wrong doing, the cashier started talking about how all \textbf{black} people complain and cry about \textbf{racism} and how they should go back to where they came from.

How many times have I had to repeat this? And you still don't get it. Listen, laughing about \textbf{racist} white people isn't going to solve anything. Your ideas are shit. White people have the power in America to be systematically \textbf{racist}. \textbf{Black} people are supposed to laugh at that?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Joey Flores Ah I'll join the fun, too...I of course didn't read all the thoughts and opinions expressed in this comment section so forgive me for voicing my opinion under those circumstances but I think I know where both of you guys are getting at generally and where you all are coming from. Both of you honestly made some fair points but I can't say that I agree with both of you 100 (that's honestly a rare phenomenon, not to patronize anybody). I'm \textbf{black}, Joey, and I don't think you deserve any sort of blame for what your ancestors did. They aren't even necessarily evil, slavery was a way of life- for many, it was just there and not many questioned it (despite how terribly unethical the system was). History is essentially how people become more reasonable and ethical together as a human \textbf{race}. What happened to \textbf{black} people during slavery is a tragedy and I'm sure you aren't proud of the subjugating enterprise your ancestors built. However, I don't quite believe that \textbf{racism} is \textbf{black} people's fault. \textbf{Racism} comes in different forms so you have to be clearer in that, Joey. Overt \textbf{racism} like the KKK or subtle microaggression \textbf{racism} like what was discussed in the video? The KKK was birthed from evil ideologies subjugating \textbf{black} people sharing commonalities with Hitler and his actions (and we can both agree that Hitler was kind of a jerk). Neither of them were rational or progressive thinkers- they acted from ideologies and instinct, truly disgusting.But when it comes to the more subtle stuff, the statistics you point out may very much play a role. It's unfortunate how involves \textbf{black} people are in crimes and how they have lower test scores, etc. So, if I'm not mistaken, this was what you meant when you said "\textbf{racism} is \textbf{black} people's fault." And to that I say, sort of. It makes me ashamed as a \textbf{black} guy to see those statistics but it is what it is. There is also the peculiar parts of \textbf{black} culture in America that play a role, like the fascination with gangs and crime in music. But what can the good, smart \textbf{black} kid with straight A's do about that? We can't discriminate against \textbf{black} people and \textbf{nothing} can justify that system. Statistics doesn't justify it. All people deserve a chance. The fact that a potentially smart straight-A \textbf{black} kid may lose a job opportunity over a potentially mediocre white kid  is absolutely unacceptable. That system of racial discrimination was built in those corporations. They didn't have to just look at \textbf{race} for determining the job offer, so many other variables could come into play. It is in that sense that I say "sort of."\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Nothing, Race, Racism & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}19/457 & \cellcolor{green!5}4.158 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small This video is complete bunk. For your first study, you show that \textbf{African} American men are discriminated against compared to Caucasian men, but you don't show the whole story because your a dishonest piece of shit with an agenda. The reason you only narrow your scope down to men is that \textbf{African} American women do not have a sentencing gap compared to Caucasian women, which, when taken with the previous piece of information, would suggest that there is something other than a racial problem instead. The marijuana study only controls for the factor of the percent of use among each population, when there are many other factors at play. For example, \textbf{African} Americans are much more likely to smoke marijuana in public, and the police tend to surveil communities with more crime, which tend to be disproportionately \textbf{African} American. \textbf{African} Americans being more likely to be stopped and search doesn't take into account any factors, such as increased police presence in communities with more crime, and increase stop and search in those communities which isn't \textbf{racist}, but this can give the appearance of \textbf{racism} because high crime communities are disproportionately \textbf{African} American. For the resume study about \textbf{black} names and white names, the problem with that is that the "distinctively" \textbf{black} names they used reflected socioeconomic status.  [LINK]  this is a new study with a bigger sample size that used distinctive names drawn from us census bureau of labor instead of just picking names which the authors believed to be white and \textbf{black} like in the study you cite, and this study also controlled for the names implying socioeconomic status. This study found no statistically significant difference in hiring. In your study about the unequal mark of a criminal record, it contained just to small of a sample size to draw any meaningful conclusions. In the study about hospital services, the multiple regression used to control for factors was linear, and using linear model is a very strong assumption and not necessarily valid. Trying to access your source for the study published in the ACP website results to a 404, so I cannot comment on that study, but from what I have seen so far, I doubt that it is very accurate. The wealth gap study, life span disparity study, the high school alg 2 chem study, the tried as adults study, and the wrongfully convicted study all don't control for any factors, meaning that they are not proof of racial disparity since there are many correlating variables with \textbf{race} (difference in outcome does not equate to \textbf{racism}). The APA/Guardian study tried to explain why there is racial discrimination in hiring, but as I showed by linking the study  [LINK]  earlier, there isn't even a racial gap in hiring, meaning these studies are trying to explain something which does not exist. Your study about the widening racial wealth gap and the role inheritance plays doesn't imply \textbf{racism} today, but rather just means that there was past \textbf{racism} and it's effects can still be seen today to some extent. I have literally debunked all your studies with 5 minutes of research. Some of the studies you intentionally misrepresent. Don't try to pretend to be some arbitrator of facts, your just a piece of shit with an agenda who misrepresents/blatantly lies about statistics to try and fool people.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}African, Black, Race, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}15/556 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.698 \\  \hline

For example, med school matriculation scores (\textbf{African} americans on average need much lower scores in both GPA and MCAT to matriculate-as an asian, I am pretty upset that I actually had to score higher than the average matriculant) [LINK]   Overall, citing differences between races and concluding there is "systemic \textbf{racism}" accomplishes \textbf{nothing}... it offers no evidence based solutions to help level any of these differences seen... all that is ever said is that there should be a vague message of "better training/education" and it has yet to be shown by any metric that these trainings do anything other than waste timeFurthermore, where do the comparisons stop? i mean what if \textbf{black} women are found to have it worse than \textbf{black} men in terms of income? does that mean there's institutional \textbf{sexism} as well? what about \textbf{black}, single, women with children having lower income? does that mean the establishment is against single mothers? what about \textbf{black}, single, women with children who own guns and are under 5' tall?... as you see you can do an infinite number of permutations until eventually you will be comparing individual differences... So to conclude, I believe (based on the evidence I have seen) that there is insufficient evidence to show that institutions are \textbf{racist} (rather I believe that it is more likely that there are individuals who are \textbf{racist})...

I'm also curious if more \textbf{hick} sounding names would get less call backs as well, I have a feeling if the applicants were 'Cletus' or 'Billy Bob' we'd see similar numbers.My main point is this I really think that a lot of the disparity that we see in the \textbf{black} community could be explained by class although I realize that \textbf{racism} is still a problem I think it's way less of a problem then class privileges. I suspect that poor blacks and poor whites have way more in \textbf{common} than poor whites and rich whites or poor blacks and rich blacks.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Common, Hick, Racism & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Ethnicity - White, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}6/192 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.125 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Ah. The \textbf{old} inequality of outcome means discrimination has occurred. This is utter nonsense. There are four main factors explaining why \textbf{black} people get longer sentences:1.) Aggravating factors (Was there a subjective element to the crime that shows a lack of forgiveness or further potential danger in a criminal?)2.) Guilty/Not Guilty Pleas (Those who plead not guilty and then are found guilty tend to get longer sentences. Those who admit it right away show the judge forgiveness and honesty, both of which are key elements to a shorter sentence.)3.) Type of Offense (Drug crimes are extremely general. Consuming marijuana is not the same as running a massive drug deal network.)4.) Prior Offenses (Is this your first time violating the law or your 17th time? Makes a big difference in the eyes of a judge.)Also, the reason that blacks are far more likely to be arrested for drug use relates in a similar way. We can just say \textbf{racism} and go to bed, but that is simplistic. Where are the most heavily policed areas in the country? Urban areas. Blacks are heavily populated in urban areas. Further, the crime rates in \textbf{black} communities are extremely high compared to their overall population. It is not good that 13 of the population is responsible for 50 of the murder (It is more like 6-7 because \textbf{black} males are the majority of murders). This same trend is represented in all other criminal offenses. High rates of crime mean the government needs to disproportionately police certain areas than others.Finally, income inequality and wealth disparity is an irrelevant argument. Just because there are rich people does not mean that they stole from the poor. Just because there are rich whites, or Jews, or Asians, or whoever, does not mean they held down the \textbf{black} people in order to achieve that wealth. Sure there was discrimination in the past and things were very unequal after slavery, but this also does not matter. Capitalism is the greatest system in the world because it is the most powerful engine of social mobility. Personal choices are the number one determinant in one's wealth and income, not generational wealth. There is a reason that Jewish people came here with \textbf{nothing} and now have the highest income by \textbf{ethnicity}. Culture and good choices lead to success. High drop out rates, crime rates, drug usage rates, single motherhood rates, glorification of drugs and women in culture, victim mentality, welfare reliance, fathers not taking responsibility, lack of morals, etc. etc. etc. are all driving factors in the disparities between blacks and whites.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Ethnicity, Nothing, Old, Racism & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}8/434 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.843 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small You'd expect this guy to use legitimate statistics and perhaps be truthful about his claims but alas he is not. The sentencing commission only looked at Federal judges and crimes NOT state crimes. When accounting for the length of probation the statistic drops to 14 and of course the major problem with the commission's report is it doesn't take into account previous offenses which is the largest factor in determining the length of a prison sentence. The gap has widened after mandatory sentencing was done away with and judges now have the discretion to sentence people based on their past crimes. But hey, I'd hate for the truth to get in the way of your videos.And as for the resume study he cites, unfortunately he is wrong again. There have been two studies one that was very narrow and heard back from ~230 employers after sending out 5,000 resumes to only a few locations which resulted in a "\textbf{racist}" bias. And then there was a study that sent out 3x as many resumes to a much larger sample size and came and resulted in no statistically significant indication of \textbf{racism}.Unfortunately your "huge body of evidence" is based on a simple understanding of statistics and economics for a complex issue.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/211 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.948 \\  \hline

To try and say that a persons point of view is not valid because they "actually" have an irrational fear is only for the purpose of manipulation and has no basis to substantiate the claim. "...as long as you are just nice to people, regardless of who they are." There is no love in being "nice" to people. There is no truth in it. Nice people lie and cover up reality to be "nice". Nice people live in fantasy land because it's "nice" to go along with the lie. Kindness is not dependent on niceness. Niceness = Political Correctness, while Kindness = Polite, Open and Truthful Dialogue. "Sorry about the first comment. I was a bit upset." Only weak people get upset easily and then judge themselves and have to apologize for their behavior. There is no goodness in being weak. Meek yes, but not weak. "You mentioned transphobia (which is, I think, like anti-\textbf{L\textbf{G\textbf{BT}}}-sentiment or just \textbf{transgender} sentiment)" Can you even make sense of that? Doesn't that just sound like a big made up mess to you when you step back and look at it? Making an "anti" \textbf{L\textbf{G\textbf{BT}}} sentiment means you have an irrational fear?

How many white people do you know personally, that have privilege? I don't know anyone that doesn't live from paycheck to paycheck.

If we do \textbf{nothing} to fix this mess our children will suffer the cost. Maybe one day we can fix it to where we can all get along, but it's not going to happen under this monetary system.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Well things have changed in the past 4 years. Now, if a \textbf{black} guy is shot, people automatically think it's an act of \textbf{racism} from a white to a \textbf{black}. There's things like \textbf{black} people association at my school, but what if you replaced \textbf{black} with white? Automatically \textbf{racism} instead of an act against \textbf{racism}. Actually, all that assosiation is doing is exasperating the problem, and pretending that all white people are against blacks. How about this. There was a \textbf{black} criminal who was attacking a cop, and the cop shot the criminal dead to save his own life. People, without being educated or listening, automatically accused the cop of being a white, \textbf{racist} man. After they accused him, they found out that he was not a white cop, but a \textbf{black} cop. If I remember right, they actually released the cop because he was \textbf{black}. Every once in a while, you will see clubs or places supporting \textbf{black} people and will have different things promoting \textbf{black} people. But you will never, ever, ever find something promoting the rights of a white person. Now swap the words \textbf{black} and white on things. Automatically, it sounds disgusting and \textbf{racist} and wrong. Oh but this isnt just for races, it's also for genders where feminazi's exist, fighting to put women on a pedestal, and calling all boys incompitant, stupid, or insulting them casually. But if a guy casually insults a girl, then its automatically sexist and all the girls flip, but if it's the other way around then guys just accept it. Not to mention, a girl is allowed to get away with so much more than men. "She thought she could, so she did" vs "he thought he could, so he did" automatically less good.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small only whites, with prosperous nations, arent allowed to do what all the others do in their own places. all these massive problems bc of the envious malevolent others who do not make their own nice places are perpetually manipulating and trying to invade other prosperous peoples places. forcing themselves into others world and demanding redistributions of wealth. its been the same since eternity everywhere, but especially demonstrated by the blacks, and the american blacks are the ultimate. they continually make tribal threats, demands, and extorted concessions by others, and the whites there usually capitulate in order to deal with them as if they would deal with any other reasonable people of like mind, except the others are proven not of like mind. their manipulative behavior and the proof of what they always create everywhere they go is well demonstrated. they have the majority of massive africa for 100,000 years yet still have not created any nicety there. the only nicety that was created in africa was created by non-blacks, and then once overrun by blacks it always crumbled. the chinese are trying it now, and their result will be the same. they cant even maintain what they take from others. and that is the only thing they have demonstrated that they do. essentially \textbf{nobody} in the world wants to go to their places, yet they demand inclusion in others places. they cannot be content with what they create for themselves as most others are. they were just forever warring with each others tribes in the infamous "10,000 tribes of africa" until the euros finally somehow gave their majorities their own nations and borders. then eventually gave up and left the africans to themselves after centuries of their failure to standardize and domesticate. they say they hate the white man but they sure do enjoy the nicety those guys created that allowed them to go from archaic caveman with population of 30 million in all of africa in 1400 when euros came, to extremely excessive 1 billion plus now. meanwhile here korea, japan, taiwan, and even \textbf{communist} china's majority tribes turned their lands into thriving nations in under 50 years. its only the people that made the place, and who can continue to make it. and all the tribes have long had their own places. american whites are the majority who also made the nicest places for themselves, and the image that the USA  was/is. exactly the same as everywhere else in the world, the yamato tribe ruling japan, joseons ruling korea, tagalog tribe in PI, and han tribes china \& taiwan. see 56+ different official tribes in china who cant even understand each other talking, being ruled by the han tribe, and dont have any of the problems the blacks bring to the americans and elsewhere. btw all these places are also now beginning to experience the problems blacks bring. see how well that goes in compassion lacking fiercely nationalist asian country. the east asians were always the poorest and most \textbf{alien} people in the USA, yet they never had any of the problems the blacks have always brought there, regardless of economics or racism/nativism/nationalism that is normal in every tribes place. the blacks invasions to others places in the USA is the equivalent of the \textbf{african} invasions of europe now, it can only be a contrived effort by enemies of those nations. it is a massive effort to manipulate the americans, watch their media and see their 12 max population of anyone claiming \textbf{black}, being portrayed as 50+ of their society/roles. forced upon the entire USA population of every other \textbf{race} who are not represented in such imaginary proportions. it is insanity, especially westward of the mississippi where blacks have had next to no history or creations. even the chinese and irish \textbf{immigrant} servants who built the railroads in california didnt have the blacks problems. it is clear that the blacks are doing to the USA exactly as they have done to south africa. the euros built their nice place at the extreme south across the desert, but even that wasnt enough. for centuries the prosperous \textbf{nation} they created from archaic wilderness and scattered bushmen was incessantly overrun by the tropical blacks from the north. now see once prosperous euro south africa completely destroyed by the tropical blacks, who are only concerned with their foolish claim that they were there before the euros came. the entire prosperous modern world is lost unless true world diversity is maintained by all the tribes in their own long established places, the very basis of a country being for a \textbf{common} people with similar heritage, culture, language, etc. the 12 blacks in the USA that have caused so many problems 24/7 for so long are simply socially incompatible. biologically as well, as demonstrated by their, and other tropical peoples, high succeptibility to diseases like severe skin, lung, and no doubt \textbf{mental} problems caused by desert biome of the western USA. such as the incurable coccidioides fungus that is most potent in all of desert californias soil and only needs go airborne or be concentrated to affect them. it is the same as the severe physical and \textbf{mental} decline that affects nontropical people who try to live in the

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Hang on...arent you making statements without taking significant context into account.For example the source u provide for blacks given 20 longer sentences im pretty sure when looked into it was a result of previous convictions not comparing identical crimes. An example from the UK...a white British adult male drove into a group of non white citizens, one died. He got 37 yrs. A non white British resident with the exact same motive of harming pedestrians hit 2 injuring them then one after another hit \& killed another 3 15 yr \textbf{old} boys. He got 14 yrs to serve 7 for dangerous driving. Both were terrorism, one was much more brutal an act (target of children) yet it was tried as a lesser crime. Also the statement regarding drug use amongst blacks/whites I'm pretty sure those figures were presented including Latinos in the white demographic specifically to suggest a racial bias. On investigation if i remember correctly in other research instances it was observed that the Latino demographic were grouped alongside the \textbf{black} community or in a non white category. Interms of who uses what were they categorized by indiv drugs, possession or distribution. Whether arms were present at location or on persons. Suspect compliance. Previous drug convictions. Defendants initial pleas and the move to jury trial in the event of a not guilty plea. Then there are issues like whether said drugs were organized into prepared package deals, whether those arrested had money from drug sales on their person, who the drugs were sold too, the drug purity, whether violence was a factor interms of the user dealer relationship and how debts would be settled, how the process of ensuring users pay up is conducted. Whether distribution was casual say supplying those around you socially as opposed to being more organised crime, supplying a custom base focused on profit.They pick and choose data, facts, study findings to suit their narrative, as do i believe u do and they manipulate data to suit their ideogical goals.The search for truth regardless of what that maybe I feel is sacrificed in order to prop up an ideological worldview in ur case. You seem to have decided that \textbf{racism} is everywhere so uve collected all data you think confirms that belief rather than test whether that theory stands up to scrutiny. Citing vox as a reputable source suggests to me some last resort scraping of ideogical barrell was needed in order to provide some type of substance to ur claims?????It's both intellectually lazy and dishonest to ignore or disregard factors that contribute specifically to such outcomes, but knowingly doin so because ideology is more important than presenting truth that contradicts it, is a disgrace.

Clearly a lot of those who viewed this content felt u provided a thorough summary of available resources from a variety of political and scientific philosophies. But that's not the case at all. Simply put, selective data is gathered and presented to prop up an established conclusion that is compatible with a particular worldview narrative rather than using an unbias, honest and ethical approach of evaluating all available resources in order to come to a realistic conclusion.It doesn't matter how many citations you provide with content if ur motives for including them aren't formed with the intent of demonstrating intellectual integrity.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small He is right, he is not a expert just another duped individual. A victim of greedy dubious social "scientist". For example, in pursuit  of my Master is Psychology with an Undergraduate  Bachelors of Science in Psychology, we learn that the actual science shows an UNIVERSAL TENDENCY to avoid, not just ethic, but any "unique" name. White people avoid hiring other White people with unusual names, as well as, those obviously from a different \textbf{ethnic} group. It shows that \textbf{Black} people avoid other \textbf{Black} people with unusual names, as well as, individuals with unusual names from any ethic group. No human welcomes the challenge of pronouncing an unusual name. We fear mispronouncing the name and experiencing embarrassment. In today's climate Whites must also fear being accused of \textbf{racism} if they find your name difficult. The social "science" wing of Psychology and Sociology do not report their findings correctly, i.e. the researchers who blatantly lied to policy makers about the racial prevalence and effects of self-esteem aka egoism. Shocker, Blacks have, since the first study in the mid-1960s, have had, by far, the highest levels of self-esteem. While Jews/Asians show having the lowest. With Whites/Hispanics presenting roughly the same middling levels. Thus, showing that the assertion that self-esteem is an essential ingredient of success, is a LIE. Self-efficacy, belief in one's ability to meet goals, only achieved through being self-critical aka possessing an Internal Locus of control, is the primary key to success. Telling someone, even if it is true, that they can't reach their goals because of an external source is cruel and creates an External Locus of control aka helplessness resulting in ensuing resentfulness. (The Costly Pursuit of Self-Esteem, Jennifer Crocker and Lora E. Park University of Michigan) Why liberal "researchers" have persisted in perpetrated this LIE seems to me a plot against all racial sectors, but specifically the \textbf{Black} American, not a plan to help.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small First what I agree with, \textbf{black} schools need to be seriously improved. Not just that though, \textbf{black} students need to be encouraged to take higher math and science classes. One thing we must consider, if there is no one taking algebra 2 or chemistry (and we cant force students to take them) then the school is likely to cut them. So a better job needs to be done motivating \textbf{black} students to seek upper level classes as well as ensuring that schools are offering these classes. \textbf{Black} culture also needs to do a better job of prioritizing education as a laudable and admirable thing to pursue and excel at.As far as a resume with a white sounding name being more likely to be called back on than a resume with a \textbf{black} sounding name, this is tricky to deal with. We are already pushing companies to embrace diversity as well as lowering the bar for college degrees for blacks. Perhaps it's the media and hollywood's fault for pushing negative stereotypes regarding blacks being difficult to work with. "The angry \textbf{black} \textbf{woman} stereotype being one of them". Some research ought to be done to determine the actual cause of this particular disparity.Now to things in the video that were at minimum misleading and at most outright wrong.Firstly the 20 longer sentencing for the same crime than white men statistic is bogus, the sentencing is longer because of repeat offences. (Example) If you have been charged with assault on 3 different occasions and are charged with a 4th assault then your sentence will be longer than someone who is charged with assault for the first time.This is the same with children being tried as adults, if you are a repeat offender then you are more likely to eventually be tried as an adult.Secondly the disparity between drug arrests is because of a higher concentration of criminal behavior among the \textbf{black} population especially the \textbf{black} population that is into drugs. Say you rob a store and get caught and you happen to have drugs on you. You are going to get charged for drug possession. However if you had drugs on you but committed no other criminal activity then it would be unlikely that you get caught or charged.Thirdly the DNA evidence disparity is bogus, DNA evidence doesn't discriminate, if your DNA is at the scene of a violent crime then you can become a suspect, especially if you have a history of criminal activity. 50 of solved murders are committed by blacks and 50 of murder victims are \textbf{black} and 89 \textbf{black} murder victims were killed by other blacks. You must also consider that the 50 \textbf{black} murder perpetrator statistic is created without including unsolved murders. Of which there is a large number, especially in \textbf{black} communities where there is a culture of obstruction and refusal to cooperate with police investigations. Even though these communities are some of the most violent communities in America. So yes if more crime is committed in \textbf{black} communities then there is going to be more DNA evidence pointing to \textbf{black} perpetrators.As a last note as far as economic disparity goes and the excuse that this is the cause of the extremely high \textbf{black} crime rates. We need to consider that there are over 3 times as many whites in poverty as blacks so if economic status is the trigger for criminal behavior then we should see at least 3 times the amount of crimes being committed by whites as blacks. This is demonstrably not the case so we must instead look at culture and the role it plays in leading people to violence and crime.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}16/616 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.597 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Unless you're including \textbf{racism} against white people, you two have no legitimate argument.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Western countries are more racially integrated in terms of legislation and cultural acceptance compared to \textbf{African}, South American and Asian countries. SO much so that Western countries are open enough to have this debate about \textbf{race}. The reason you don't see "\textbf{racism}"  in countries like Japan, Nigeria, Peru, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam etc is because there is very little multiculturalism in those countries. What I think people living in western countries with values of multiculturalism should realize is that:1) They are fortunate to live in a diverse \textbf{nation}2) Racial biases are not necessarily imposed on minorities, but instead are a result of complex soci-economi-cultural differences that are yet to merge with western values.3) Lastly, a great experiment would be to go and live in a non western country where your \textbf{ethnicity} is the absolute minority and see how multi cultural their values are.

Is this really the fault of widespread (vague) \textbf{racism} or just \textbf{racism} on an individual level? If anyone can name a \textbf{racist} institution in America that would be great because it would be good to educate myself more about it. Also did this vid take into account that blacks also commit a disproportionate amount of crime in America? The Bureau of Justice Statistics state that while being 13 of the population blacks commit half of homicides in the \textbf{nation}. Isn't this more of an economic problem than a \textbf{race} one?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small John, I'm playing Devil's Advocate here I need help in understanding in why the allegation of systemic \textbf{racism} is being treated as gospel and not recognized as what it is: a presumption. Let me preface the following in that I'm not in any way denying \textbf{racism} exists, it most certainly isn't dead, but what I call into question is how pervasive it allegedly is. Yes, there's a disparity in the statistics, but statistics don't explain themselves and you said so yourself that you can't divorce the situation from factors like economic and/or class status. Like I can tell you immediately that there's huge looming coincidences like our legal system being heavily "capitalized", meaning the more money you have, the less likely you face indictment or as harsh a punishment as compared to someone who can't afford a decent lawyer....   and given that there is a much greater percentage of whites in better economic standing, how can you say then the disparity present within the legal system is, without a shadow of a doubt, anchored in \textbf{racist} motivations, when we can clearly see that a person's financial standing, again, has a measurable impact on the quality of justice dispensed from case to case?...  especially when we recognize that half the \textbf{black} populace is situated in the lowest income bracket and by proxy bad, high crime neighborhoods that are heavily policed (which makes sense when you think about it). Paraphrased, why are we treating this as truth, when the possibility exists that the system only appears \textbf{racist} (with respect to the legal woes) and the core issue is income inequality within a heavily capitalized system? And I use that as an example....Saying \textbf{nothing} of the fundamental issue that is it's literally impossible to prove a motive...  you're no better able to prove what my motive was for buying a can spray paint than anyone is proving what motivates the "system". I do not understand, when we advocate how important critical assessment is to such ridiculously heavy weight topics such as this, we entertain an unsubstantiated, and arguably biased assumption. And you can't tell me it isn't. I say all this not because I'm on the "right" (i'm in the middle) or I'm against civil rights or what not, it's because I see glaring issues in the thought processes leading to that particular conclusion. It's far easier to rationalize what we're witnessing is rooted in financial inequality than that of racial bias.Really consider what I'm saying here. if I ask you why the system would be racially biased, the best answer you're gonna be able to come with is essentially because reasons...  or because "it was before" - any other reasoning and you're pretty much justifying \textbf{racism}. If I were to ask you why the system would be economically biased, the answer is undeniably more tenable...   because we live in a roughly capitalist \textbf{nation}. Let me restate something: I'm not saying \textbf{racism} doesn't exist as it most certainly does, but these assumptions and allegations need to be more closely examined and constructively criticized because there is definitely a lot of room for doubt.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Nation, Nothing, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}9/522 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.724 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small While you do prove a good point that there seems to be an inherent bias against the \textbf{colored} community, I have some statistics that may make this bias seem a bit less exagurated. Regarding the educational bias I would like point out how much those extra programs cost and because of how broken federal and state school funding systems are many schools are dependent on income from students and students families. now given that information it would make sense that in minority dominated schools, which tend to reside near low income neighborhoods, would have fewer programs than that of ethnically proportional schools. nearly 40 of welfare recipients are \textbf{African} American, which isn't even close to proportional for any potential bias put forth to be explained as \textbf{racism}, which would explain also the lack there of high end programs in minority dominated schools. Regarding the chances of reemployment this can be explained by the fact that 38 of homicides are committed by \textbf{African} Americans and this higher rate of violent crimes can cause a stereotype of all convicted \textbf{black} men being more violent, while this isn't true individually the statistics do show they disproportionally are as only 31 of homicides are committed by white people despite outnumbering \textbf{African} Americans 5 to 1. Regarding any type of racial bias believed to exist in the police force I would like to point out that white men are TWICE as likely to be killed by police than blacks. many would say that this isn't proportional as \textbf{African} Americans only consist of 13 of the population but that wholly isn't true because if you factor in violent crime offences the numbers should be around equally. It is a undeniable fact that the \textbf{black} community has a disproportional amount of crime. FBI statistics show that blacks despite being outnumbered 5 to 1 commit 8 times as many crimes against whites as vice versa. statistics also show that 24 of hate crimes are committed by blacks despite them consisting of only 13 of the population. As I see it, while there are white racists as there are racists in every \textbf{ethnicity}, \textbf{African} Americans are much more \textbf{racist} and crime driven, not individually but generally, than other ethnicities in the united states and the enforcement of law and retaliation from these crimes is being mistaken as \textbf{racism}. statistically white people are the second most racially accepting group behind Latinos, only committing 54 of hate crimes despite consisting of 64 of the population, and I know me saying these things will be "controversial" or "\textbf{racist}" but facts are facts so I would like you, whether a liberal, a conservative, a \textbf{black} lives matter supporter, or a all lives matter supporter, to sit back and look at the numbers. some may explain it as \textbf{racist} stricter convictions but as I see it the numbers are way to out of proportion to be explained as hate in our modern western society.P.S.-  regarding the drug crime convictions I would like to point out that those statistics lack to include an information regarding covictions following the initial one. each time you get the same charge it will extend the sentence of that charge generally. Also regarding the wage gap it has been found that for women and minorities in many places tend to be less prone to asking for a raise from the natural personalities and the automatic assumption they won't get it because of what they are. I would like to comment that trying to get wages for a single job to be universal in a work place is stupid as that will cause people who do a ton of work to get paid equal to that of those who sit there and do little to no work. the best way to have racial and \textbf{gender} based pay gaps to be fixed for similar jobs is to just leave it to unions because what the federal system is able to do applies way to broadly for it not to have easily noticeable bad after effects.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}African, Black, Colored, Ethnicity, Gender, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}16/674 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.374 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small You know, I'm all aboard with your videos. Your explanation of Syria, of Assad, and of our relationship with them (and Russia) was \textbf{nothing} short of perfect. However- Statistics are cold, as you said. Statistics can be presented in a more bias fashion than they were written. You want to mention sentence length- but that doesn't represent the individuals criminal history. And more importantly in my opinion, you didn't mention the crime rates of \textbf{African} Americans when scaled against the white population. Nor did you mention the drop out rate, or single parenthood rate. These paint a much more clear picture on what can seemingly be pointed as a prosecution issue, and really shine the light on a major culture issue. We're blaming our government for punishing people who do bad things, when really, we should be trying to prevent people from doing bad things in the first place. The \textbf{black} community wants to unify against our government for systemic \textbf{racism}, however they seemingly want to have no part in keeping their community educated or keeping the fathers in the lives of their children. That alone will only continue to generate this perpetual loop. We need to fix our government (in a million ways), but before we can do that we need a community of people who aren't 7 times a likely to kill us or rob us (statistically) on our side.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The longer sentences is directly related to criminal history. In other words, \textbf{black} people are more often repeat offenders so they face harsher sentences. More \textbf{black} people caught on drug charges is related to more \textbf{black} people being more open about using illegal drugs. For instance, a \textbf{black} person will more often sit on the porch, and light up a blunt, where as a white person will be more likely to do so in the garage.Your point about names is about names, not \textbf{race}.

If \textbf{black} people picked less stupid names for their children they would be hired more.Mostly minority schools have less advanced classes like algebra 2.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I respectfully disagree with you Mr. Green. As you so often say, and in fact hinted at at the beginning, this a a topic so tied to nuance that if "systemic bias" had a synonym it would be nuance. Cops pull over \textbf{black} people more often? Yes they do but crimes like violence, drug DEALING and robbery are overwhelmingly disproportionately committed by \textbf{black} people and more white collar crimes that require investigations are more often committed by white people. One of these group of crimes can interrupted easily on the street level and one less so... cops have a limited resources and have to use it as well as possible and that means beat cops work the street level crimes that just so happen to occur in some neighborhoods more than others. Job applications aren't as well reviewed for \textbf{ethnic} people than white people but Asian people do better than both and that's due to perceived stereotypes driven by undeniable cultural differences and I believe an educated person of any color can see that. I will give that the court system is in fact rigged but it's against the poor who disproportionately happen to be \textbf{black}. Judges see people with no future inside or out and think to themselves their better off off the streets, it's a HORRIBLE thing to do but I've personally seen it done. The wealth thing is a game of haves and have nots and while the system was rigged in the past to prevent \textbf{ethnic} peoples of succeeding but it's not now and your trying to shush an echo. (What I'm about to say could be considered rasict but it's only to convey the point to the largest audience) everyone on 8mile had the same shot that Eminem did but he had the talent to get out based his raping and happened to be white the same way you John happened to have the talent to make it as writer.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I guess I'd want to know what you mean by "systemic \textbf{racism}". It's a \textbf{fuzzy} term. For example, if you say "there's systemic \textbf{racism} in the justice system" do you mean the judges and lawyers and laws are literally \textbf{racist}? Or do you mean the disparity in the numbers is in some part explained by \textbf{racism} that has occurred in the past, even though those systems are not systemically (as in, built into the system) \textbf{racist}? For each statistic you site, it's important to clarify whether it is a product of an intentional \textbf{racist} decision ("I have decided the \textbf{black} schools by law shall not teach algebra") or some confluence of circumstances some of which are related to \textbf{race} but many not ("School budget can't afford it etc...."). Look. I'm \textbf{black}, so by the poster's account I must've been a victim of \textbf{racism} at some point right? And it's true, I've encountered \textbf{racist} people. I've had things not go my way where I wonder, is that because of my \textbf{race}... or not? In some cases it's impossible to tell. But those who like to throw around "systemic \textbf{racism}" like to insinuate if not outright state that every institution in society is secretly \textbf{racist} and acting against me. That hasn't been my experience. My experience of the world has been too complex to see it only in \textbf{black} and white. I'm here because the poster suggested I come here (ironically, from a post about Invisible Man, a book ultimately about being an individual) because it shows how "systemic \textbf{racism} isn't up for debate". And yet all the video confirms is what everyone already knows: blacks were kept down for a while, and that contributes to our collectively being behind now (to what degree and how exactly varies according to opinion), and some \textbf{racist} people exist even today.

As far as this relates to \textbf{racism}, from what I can tell and understand the main cause of modern \textbf{racism} in America is the fact that historical events, some which were pointed out in other people's earlier comments who know more on the subject, have caused a disproportionate portion of the \textbf{black} population of America to fall into poverty and fall into crime, which leads some people to associate \textbf{black} people with crime, which causes more poverty, which causes more crime, which causes more \textbf{racism}, which causes etcetera.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@True Aries I'm not \textbf{racist} whatsoever. And the topic doesn't bother me, I'm just disagreeing with you. But yes, Irish people literally were enslaved, do YOUR research. The same way \textbf{Black} people were. This happened many years before \textbf{Black} slavery happened, and they were also released sooner. But even after they were released they were literally treated so bad that they were starving to death and killing their babies in the streets. Read the poem "A Modest Proposal", a famous piece of writing in the perspective of British Nobles talking about eating Irish Babies as it would be better for society. It's a humourous look into the way Irish people felt that British treated them at the time. But ok, maybe in the deep south there are pockets of \textbf{racism}. But telling ALL white people that it's their responsibility to change that is ridiculous. Saying all white people are \textbf{racist} because of that is is not fair. There are places that are a majority \textbf{black} where white kids are bullied in school and where people call us "whiteboy". How is that different from what you are referring to?

Of course there's charts (from years ago, it'd be nice to have updated data) but why does this not talk about white crime relative to others? That sentence came out a bit \textbf{weird}, but for example, a lot of sentences read like this: 'Blacks are the main cause of urban crime‚Ä¶', 'blacks are even more dangerous when compared to whites‚Ä¶', etc. A lot of it reads like 'blacks/hispanics are like this compared to whites'. Instead of (or rarely) 'hispanics are like this compared to blacks' or vice versa or something. I didn't see many other types of comparisons. Like why not talk about how things would be different if a place (Maybe not even NY or IL) was all Hispanic or whatever. Also, it never really talked about white on white crime being an epidemic, but talked at length about how \textbf{black} on \textbf{black} crime was a huge problem despite having similar murder rates for other races. Also, poverty wasn't talked about as being a major factor in these things. For example as a response to police killing more blacks than other races, he writes 'Police shootings of unarmed blacks is a very small problem compared to murder in the \textbf{black} community.' The same could be said for other races, though‚Ä¶In the same vein, some of the information seemed a bit unnecessary or superfluous: (ex) 'Three of the six officers charged in Gray's death were \textbf{black} ‚Äî and they were charged with the most serious crimes ‚Äî but the incident is still cited as an example of police \textbf{racism}.' The fact that they were \textbf{black} doesn't mean it wasn't \textbf{racism}. Also, he mentions that BLM was not driven by data, but in the same section says 'an unarmed \textbf{black} was therefore 5.6 times more likely than an unarmed white to be shot by police'. Actually, a lot of BLM supporters talk about similar stats. These are just a few problematic selections.This piece just seemed like‚Ä¶not equally distributed as far as the conversation was geared.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Painter Mike¬†despite what you may have heard, "\textbf{racist} liberal" is almost an oxymoron. liberals tend to be more aware of \textbf{race} and therefore conscious of it. we are that way because we recognize that subconscious \textbf{racism} (most of which comes from the right wing), even that that's not intended to hurt anyone, has caused this huge disparity between races in the U.S.there's always been \textbf{racism} in the U.S. For \textbf{black} people it of course began with slavery. It's important to keep in mind that only 150 years ago were they freed from slavery to white people. That's two average lifespans- almost no time at all in terms the rate of change when it comes to nations, peoples, etc. The entire south hated the outcome and their opinions on \textbf{black} people did not change at all. Now it's changed some, but to think that it's not the usual in the south is naive.When slavery ended, \textbf{black} people still had \textbf{nothing} and anyone who had anything hated them. This of course was an extremely difficult obstacle to surmount when trying to do well for themselves and as a result most struggled. Th white majority saw their poverty and believed they were all lazy and stupid and the \textbf{racism} continued. This has been the cycle for decades. If aliens came to earth and saw only that cycle, it might be hard for them to know the truth. However we know for a fact what happened first- slavery. \textbf{Racism}. The answer is in the origin.Some might say they should be able to pull themselves out of it but that's easier said than done. Anyone who hasn't personally been able to be successful after starting off uneducated and illiterate with no skills, possessions, money, family, or home in a society that hates them with no escape is not really in a position to make that claim. Personally I think the amount of progress many have made is remarkable for happening within two lifespans since slavery and only 50 years since full legal equality. Fifty years. They  were, under the law, officially, lesser than white people. The law said white people were better. When a nation's law says that, what can you expect its people to believe? All the change that's been made is owed to "liberals" (in quotes because it's relative), \textbf{black} and white- many of whom were hated during their time. MLK was hated by many. Hindsight is 20/20.So when it comes to \textbf{black} people "policing themselves" and fixing the problem themselves, I say that's a selfish, unsympathetic, and rude attitude. It was the U.S. government that caused \textbf{black} people to be in the situation they've been clawing their way out of for generations, and therefore it has an obligation to try to make amends.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Nothing, Race, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}13/466 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.79 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Lee Baker¬†I appreciate your thoughtful response. I would ask you, though, if you believe people are in poverty because of lack of self-discipline, some questions (broken into more)1.  How do you believe people come to posses self-discipline? Are children born with it, or taught it as they grow?2. How do you believe people come to be undisciplined? Is it that, at the start of humanity, some people were born more disciplined than others and kin tended to be like their parents? What brought about this lack of discipline within people/society, in your opinion? What's its history in the world/U.S.?3. Do you believe an undisciplined person can  help their self? If so, how? If you believe it's possible for people to be born with less self-discipline, do you believe they themselves are to blame?4. If a child is born to undisciplined parents and in an undisciplined community and comes to lack self-discipline, who do you believe is to blame there? In your opinion, should society step in to give that child a better chance? And at what point do you think he or she goes from being a victim of its circumstances to an undisciplined adult who is to be blamed for its own outcome?5. What do you believe  is the reason behind there being a disproportionate amount of \textbf{black} and dark skinned people living in poverty?Sorry, I know that's a lot, so I won't expect a reply too soon. If you're willing to have a discussion, so am I.

Single mother households of white people in poverty tend to do worse than a regular \textbf{black} household in poverty. The lack of discipline is due to the fact that they have no father figure to set them straight on some things that a mother just can't do.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!27}2/90 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.222 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small One thing also to take into account (when talking about laws from state to state) is that 55 of blacks live in the south, where in general sentences tend to be much harsher.  You would have to look at the statistics on a state by state basis, and account for prior records (which increases sentencing times).  Another factor to consider is (in general) poor blacks tend to be in urban areas while poor whites tend to be in rural areas.  Even accounting for all other factors, urban areas tend to have higher rates of crime.  This greatly increases the chances of running into the police (smaller areas constantly being patrolled or called to), and would therefore increase the probability of getting caught committing a crime.  With things spread out more, it is a lot easier to avoid police overall and to get away with a crime (the distance could increase the time to respond, not as many potential witnesses, etc).  Also, in a rural area, you are more likely to know someone... an encounter with the police might go quite differently if they already know who you are or are friends with your family, instead of another random person in a sea of people.  In rural areas, it is much easier to be self sufficient, even if that means growing some of your own food or having animals like chickens.  Because of less people in a given area, it is easier to find a niche you can fill, which leads to more opportunities.  Sure, there might be less jobs overall, but also less people, and at least the opportunity to provide for yourself in ways you cannot do in an apartment in a city.  With drugs, for instance, a high rate of usage and a larger population to sell to, combined with less opportunity, leads to increased profits... meaning you are more likely to see people take that risk in an urban setting.  Like he said in the video, socioeconomic conditions play a role.  Although there are about 2x as many whites on food stamps as blacks as an overall number, per capita more blacks are more likely to be in the worst socioeconomic conditions than whites.  If you take this into account, it makes sense that you would see increased rates of crimes that is disproportionate.  None of this helps with profiling or discrimination.  Sure, it is \textbf{racist} to judge someone by their \textbf{race} or name (and not a good thing to do) but no one can argue that statistically it improves probability to do so.  To be clear, I'm certainly not defending this, I'm just trying to get at WHY it happens.  Our brains work in such a way that we naturally try to see patterns, even when they don't exist.  Calling "heads" in a coin flip is a good example... thinking rationally we know it is a 50/50 chance, but still biases and irrational thinking guides our decision making.  If there exists a pattern that can be shown statistically, it would be surprising not to see that (as sad as that is to admit).  There is a lot of nuance in statistics (far more than he covered in this video) and if anyone is trying to find statistics to support their position you will likely find what you are looking for.  Hell, two people can look at the same set of statistics and use them to come to very different conclusions (especially when trying to determine causation).  I'm simply covering some of the points that run counter to the position of the video to flush out some more nuance and things to consider (not defending a position).\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Race, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/610 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.328 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@RepComm No, he makes a video about misleading statistics and immediately jumps to the conclusion that it's due to \textbf{racism}. I mean, he even admitted in the beginning that he's "not an expert" so that already makes his video open to doubt. Here's a general analysis of the problems that I can see at first glance:> His first point about 20 longer sentences for blacks is misleading as the data does not take into account the fact that most of those blacks are repeat offenses, and that when they do the same crime multiple times, judges are less lenient the second or third time around and they get the book thrown at them. Also, there's another statistic floating around that claims that men are sentenced 20 longer than women. If this is true, then according to the guy in the video's logic, the criminal justice system is sexist. I say this just to put his thoughts into perspective...> His second point about the relation between drug use and drug possession is another misleading statistic; it's like apples to oranges. For one thing, it should be noted that causation does not mean correlation. I could just leave it as that, but that would be a cop out. So let's instead think about this rationally. Drug possession encompasses both drug use and simply having the drugs. This is important because drug dealers are often not drug users since they don't want to consume their own merchandise. Also, police are more interested in pursuing drug dealers (such as El Chapo) rather than the small fry drug users, which is why they often let drug users off the hook when they rat their drug dealers to the cops. With this in mind, we can look at the drug use/possession correlation and deduce that there are more \textbf{black} drug dealers than white drug dealers. Yes, the possibility that blacks are being targeted still exists, but it's important to realize that it's not as clear as the guy in the video makes it out to be, and to act like it is shows an inherent bias towards cops in general.> My last point will be about blacks being more likely to be pulled over than whites while whites are more likely to have contraband. For one thing, the report that he cites only examines the city of Los Angeles. To conclude that his report represents the entirety of American police departments is a non-sequitur as it only gives us a representation of the city and the city alone. In all honesty, it appears to me that there was indeed racial bias in the city of Los Angeles in the year 2004 (the article was published in 2008 and they state near the end that the research was "more than 4 years \textbf{old}"). There are some concerns I have with the report. For one thing, they openly admit that their data was only collected from "select neighborhoods." This tells me that it isn't even an analysis of the city of Los Angeles itself and that the neighborhoods were selected simply because they paint a better picture of racial discrimination. However, assuming that the researchers controlled variables for high-crime neighborhoods and poverty, it really does seem that some form of a bias existed somewhere in Los Angeles. I will again state that this doesn't prove that it's a societal problem in America today.That's all I'll say for now...\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Old, Racism & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/574 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.523 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small So in this video on "\textbf{Racism}", Green makes the classic move of only looking at data that supports his argument. Is looking at \textbf{black} v white data really the best way to determine \textbf{racism} in America? What about exploring the data for other races other than blacks? For example, guess which \textbf{race} has the high income in the US? If you guessed whites, you're wrong. The \textbf{race} that has the highest income, by far, are Asians. That right, Asians have a far higher income than whites, blacks, etc. It would seem to me that any income by \textbf{race} would be decent data to include in any exploration of \textbf{race} in the US. So this video does what almost all videos that explore "\textbf{race}" do...they don't actually explore \textbf{race}. Not even at fundamental level.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I think \textbf{racism} is a problem in America still (ESPECIALLY in Police profiling) but I don't really know how much laws can help. Arbitrary quotas of  "x-number of \textbf{black} people in this job" don't solve the underlying problems, I think. I also think you hit a bit point when you said that in many ways the \textbf{Black} community suffers from generally being lower class and is somehow getting worse, despite conventional wisdom indicating that the opposite would happen as we got more "progressive." I think a very real possibility is that the \textbf{racist} policies of the past set the community (in general, there are many exceptions) on a track of self-destruction that was only aided by tension with the police. Now, you have a culture that's all it's own and starting to spin out of control. I'm not really sure how to fix it, because there aren't really any \textbf{racist} policies to change. All I do know is that it's messed up.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}5/162 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.086 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The point to the arbitrary quotas is kinda that a big reason that there's not "x \textbf{black} people in this job" already is sort of because... there's not \textbf{black} people on that job yet. It's self reinforcing, like the other problems you spoke of, because the people hiring are mostly or exclusively white, they are often (albeit for stupid, nonsensical reasons) not gonna hire \textbf{black} people as much, especially for that same high position which will in the future decide who gets hired.That can also in turn lead to \textbf{black} people over time not pursuing that career, as it seems pointless to hit a dead end where you can't get accepted to. And then as fewer \textbf{coloured} people are available in that field, it gives a smaller pool to draw from and thus results may be statistically lower just through probability, which in turn reinforces the view that \textbf{black} people underperform and thus their applications are undervalued and on and on it goes.So while it does seem unfair at the surface, it's still a bit hard to find a different solution than just getting some \textbf{black} people in and show that it works to break the cycle. Definitely shouldn't be needed, and doesn't at the core change the fact that people just need to stop being biased, but since the balance is so skewed to begin with, it would be an attempt to "skew back" so to speak.I super agree with your comment othewise though, it's so goddamn annoying that it's even an issue anymore and it feels hard to change it, seeing as no matter what the law says, you can't easily change the scary way some people think :(\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, coloured & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!27}7/284 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.465 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Most of these are not proof of \textbf{racism}. Your claim that blacks are more likely to be charged with heavier sentences does not take into account prior offenses.\textbf{Black} people are more likely to be arrested for drug possession and be stopped and frisked because they live in more heavily policed neighborhoods. That, in and of itself, can be a problem, but it really isn't proof of \textbf{racism}.You may have something on the DNA exonerations. The link you provided no longer works.\textbf{Black} kids are potentially more likely to be tried as adults because of repeat offenses, too. The same logic applied to callbacks.The name study where the "\textbf{black}" names are less likely to get hired proves \textbf{nothing} about \textbf{race} discrimination. I can't prove this, but I have no doubt that if an identical study was done except names like Billy Jean and Candy were used instead, the results wouldn't be much different. It is because the names are abnormal. It doesn't have to be because of \textbf{race}.The issue of some courses not being given at some \textbf{black} and latino schools is a big problem, and so is the increasing segregation.The report that shows that blacks are more likely to be suspended ignores prior offenses. That, again, may be a factor worth considering. And also maybe the fact that blacks are perceived as older (as the article points out). I am not saying the \textbf{racism} cannot be a factor, but you need to take into account all of the factors when looking at these studies. You really aren't helping, by spreading unneeded \textbf{race} hysteria.

I said that this was a ridiculous question, but I also said that if I was forced to bet, I would say no, it is not a major factor. (Keep in mind, this does not mean it isn't a factor at all. Just not a major factor.)You then proceeded to ignore my answer to your question, instead focusing on how I said it was "ridiculous", and accused me of "dodging" it. You then said I was probably a \textbf{racist} for "dodging" it. I did not dodge it; I answered clearly; I suggest you scroll back and re-read that part of the conversation.So at this point, I recognized that you really, really wanted me to be a \textbf{racist}. So when you asked your next question, I responded with this knowledge at the back of my mind. You asked why I thought blacks had more prior offenses. I responded with this exact statement: "If you honestly think I am going to claim blacks are inherently bad, then you truly are stupid." I didn't answer directly, but it was an answer.You then proceeded to ignore the obvious implication that I don't believe blacks are inherently bad by focusing in on the fact that I called you stupid. You then said that this is also "dodging", and, yet again, accused me of probably being \textbf{racist}. You literally accused me of being \textbf{racist} for saying blacks are not inherently bad. I don't care how you rationalize this in your mind, this has got to be some of the most spectacular \textbf{mental} gymnastics I have ever seen.I'm sorry, but I am convinced that you are a SJW, or at least a SJW-lite.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Mental, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}7/345 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.029 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small +elizabeth randallYou mean when John said how approximately 30 of majority-\textbf{black} schools don't offer algebra 2 and chemistry vs a "much higher" percentage for majority-white schools?You're assuming the distribution of subject choices among \textbf{black} and white kids is the same, which is isn't. Let me elaborate.Let's say a school has majority white students, and it offers chemistry, physics, maths, english, music, korean and art. Say 50 chose maths, 80 chose english, 40 chose physics, 30 chose chemistry, 20 chose music, 5 chose korean, 10 chose art and 1 drop out.Now imagine the exact same school but with majority \textbf{black} students. Still offers the same subjects; chemistry, physics, maths, english, music, korean and art. But do you think the percentages of students in each subject will be the same? Spoiler, they're not. Just like Asians tend to go for the harder mathy subjects, blacks do the reverse. So it makes sense that some of the schools don't offer the same courses, it's supply and demand.Speaking of Asians, it's funny the same disparities between whites and blacks occur between asians and whites. Asians are significantly less likely to get arrested than whites. Asians are significantly less likely to go to jail than whites. Asians make 20 more than whites on average. Asian-majority schools are much higher quality than white-majority schools. Asians are more likely to get employed. Asians have a lower dropout rate.¬†But you would never argue that \textbf{racism} exists between whites and asians in favour of asians, would you?

Please give me any evidence to indicate Asians have to work harder than Whites to get the same reward. You're full of shit.And also I'm not saying between Whites and Asians there is \textbf{racism} against Whites. I'm saying that if you play this little identity politics game of \textbf{racism} between Blacks and Whites (which is what this is all about), then you should also apply that logic to all races, and instead of blaming white men for all the problems of society, you should really be blaming Asian men because economically and educationally, they're at the top of the hierarchy, not whites. If you're gonna play identity politics, atleast play it right, don't be a hypocrite and only analyse whites vs blacks.However I say that the reason Asians outperform Whites is because they are more culturally pushed to do so (or it may even be biological). They're better because they work harder because they're encouraged to. They break less laws because they're so conscientious from working hard. That doesn't make Whites oppressed by Asians. Statistical differences in \textbf{race} is not proof of \textbf{racism}.¬†Same thing goes with the \textbf{black}-white \textbf{race} differences. \textbf{Black} people don't study as hard as Whites because they're culture doesn't push them that way. For example, the majority of blacks grow up raised by a single mother, no father. That makes a huge difference in educational and financial opportunities. And why do their fathers leave? That's a good question, but it's certainly not white people forcing them. If as many blacks were raised by 2 parents as whites, who knows what disparities between the 2 races would disappear?¬†Lesson: Statistical differences in \textbf{race} is not proof of \textbf{racism}.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Race, Racism & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}8/294 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.721 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I am oppressed. Please help me. \textbf{African} American, tax paying liberal opposed the Iraq War years ago. Got me on some type of harassment/anti-terrorist list; every aspect of my life negatively affected. Work life, health, wrote letters of complaint to State Dept., American Civil Liberties Union, Justice Dept., no help. Harassment continues. Sent documents to Norway requesting political asylum, U.S. Postal Service told me when I checked with them that documents weren't delivered and they have no idea what happened to them. I'm \textbf{disabled}, some in my family have been used to try to entrap me, especially when I was applying for social security disability, which, by the way a Legal Aid attorney recommended I do after I became ill. My life is hell. Any suggestions on how I can get out of here, and/or help my family, who I suspect has become entrapped in some government agency's attempt to entrap me.  In my apartment I am followed from room to room. Suspect my computer is monitored. People have suddenly appeared outside my apartment making loud noises, at all times of day or night, frightening me. Two vehicles have hit me. Maybe 5 others have aimed themselves at me. I've been called the "n" word, had my foot stomped on by a man on the bus, been kicked hard in the butt as I sat at my sister's college graduation. My path is blocked as I try to use the sidewalk, therefore just to reach my destination in a timely way with minimal harassment I've taken to riding my mobility device in the street, as close to the sidewalk as I possibly can, as a bicyclist would. When I do not do that, people suddenly appear in front of me, blocking my way. All true. Any organizations that help honest citizens who's only crime was to oppose a war, in two private conversations. Kid you not. Help/advice would be greatly appreciated. Several health problems. Severe insomnia. Suspect I have post traumatic stress disorder. This harassment has been ongoing for over 15 years. As I type this someone in the upstairs apartment stands just over me, moving slightly, to show that they are there, and I suspect monitoring me as I lay on my bed typing these words.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small About the applications. There's such a thing as cultural clashing which is a well known thing in business. Basically if you do offshore in-sourcing of an \textbf{Indian} software developer you may very well face an effectiveness penalty even if you have extra manpower (depends on size of team primarily). These issues tend to be about miscommunication or different cultural standards for how responsibility is handled etc.While I'm certain not all cases were that. It's disingenuous to translate that particular number into 50 \textbf{racist} non-replies.I find the  difference between white-highedu and white-lowedu vs its \textbf{black} counterpart in the study to be rather indicative of that. \textbf{Black} people gained 9 response from having higher education, whites gained 30. So with white people being a very large group of people compared to \textbf{black} people in the US the cultural clashing becomes more of a concern with jobs requiring higher levels of education since their time is more worth. Even if teams tend to be smaller the bias should lean towards white people right? You'd rather hire someone more likely not to clash than someone more likely.Looking at the demographics of people in Boston 2002 (when study was conducted). The population is disproportionately white compared to the US in general.So with that in mind. Would it make sense to hire someone with that risk over an identical person without that risk? Well it's my understanding they didn't send identical resumes. It's not mentioned anywhere in the link that was provided by you and that'd be a point to be made if that had been done given the overall detail of the description of the paper in the article.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I think it is important to make a clear difference between \textbf{racism} and cultural bias.

Or they don't like the fact that it is nearly impossible to dispute a \textbf{racism} lawsuit if you have to fire then individual. And while it isn't fair they also have to keep in mind their clientele.

So if I'm trying to fill that position I want someone my customers won't feel intimidated by. And even think of the name example. If you are hiring someone for customer service which name is easier to understand over the phone, the name Emily or Dawshanda?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I think it's worth mentioning that a large part of 'white privilege' is essentially 'non-poor privilege', what I mean by that is that a white man named Cleatus who wears overalls will obviously be taken less seriously that a \textbf{black} man named Clarence wearing a suit. I think it's important to note that not all white people benefit from being white, if a man is thought to be poor and uneducated he will be treated badly, a \textbf{black} man is more likely to be considered poor and uneducated. I don't at all mean to say that this is entirely the case, and that there is not a downside to being \textbf{black}, I only mean to say that the 'upside to being white' does not extent to all white people, and is therefore clearly not actually due to being white, rather it is due to certain factors which are more commonly expected from \textbf{black} people. Not that there is no benefit at all to being white, it's just not as simple as white=privileged or \textbf{black}=disadvantaged, and there are obviously other factors involved.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Living For Tony \& Kerry Olitz Scandal¬†You seem to have extrapolated far more from what I said than is justified. I was simply saying that there is more to white privilege than '\textbf{black}=bad white=good'. I'm not making any excuses, I've not said that discrimination based entirely on \textbf{race} does not exist, however in attempting to fix this problem I think it's important to try to understand that the issue is a complex mixture of prejudice against class and assumptions of class, as well as prejudice against colour. I've not said anything about those who are actually prejudiced against colour, and I've not said anything about being prejudiced against the poor being better than \textbf{racism}, maybe if you calm down and stop blindly fighting anything that even mentions \textbf{race} we can have a rational discussion and actually achieve something. This isn't a constant battle of one side verses another, some of us are merely trying to understand the complex situation. If you really think that these ideas result in any 'excuses' being made for some people then perhaps you should re-evaluate your stance and your dislike for these people, because if honest discussion and the removal of a misunderstanding results in a level of forgiveness and understanding then perhaps they were deserving of it. I'm sure you would not hate a \textbf{black} person for looking down on a poor person, even if you disagreed with it. Obviously those racists who this doesn't apply to are not forgiven by this, but those who simply are being human and are associating one thing with another due to it being frequent are obviously wrong to do so, but they are not the racists you say they are. I understand that some people could perhaps hide behind my point to defend their \textbf{racist} views, but that doesn't make what I said any less correct.Now as for your points, I don't know if you can say that a poor white man would be treated the same as a poor \textbf{black} man, perhaps you are right but to assume that the majority of people would do so is quite a jump.And my comment is not at all irrelevant if that were to be the case, it would simply imply that poor discrimination was not all of the problem. Which, had you not been so militant in your approach, you would see I never said.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Brian MilesListen son, you're NEVER going to solve issues of \textbf{racism}, that's a fact. In fact, all types of prejudice will continue to exist no matter how much you try. Get used to it.With that said, the guy in the video is a \textbf{fruitcake}. His logic is "We don't know what explains this, must be \textbf{racism}." Take for example his drug example at 0:52. Drug possession and drug use are two completely different things. The reason why you see so many more blacks arrested for drug possession is because there are more blacks dealing drugs rather than taking drugs. A drug dealer is a far more valuable criminal in the eyes of the police and will target them more often than small drug offenders. Also, a drug dealer probably isn't going to consume their own drugs as that will essentially hurt their business, so they can still possess drugs without ever taking them. In short, the racially disproportionate drug arrest rate isn't due to \textbf{racism}, but it's due to the fact that there are more blacks dealing drugs than white people, and police are more interested in arresting dealers rather than users.All it takes is some critical thinking and research to dismantle the myths that social justice warriors spread. \textbf{Racism} does exist against everyone unfortunately, and that's only because human being will naturally have their biases and assumptions. But is there systemic \textbf{racism} against blacks in the US, hell no, far from it. If anything, there's systemic \textbf{racism} against straight white men since we have affirmative action laws that force companies and schools to favor racial minorities and women over white men. Now THAT is legal systemic discrimination.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Fruitcake, Racism & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality & \cellcolor{green!5}7/281 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.491 \\  \hline

Also it'd make sense if there are more blacks dealing drugs but the police should keep it within a certain statistic as if it is only 1 more likely there should not be 100 more checks on the \textbf{race}.Finally these issues are complex and like the "\textbf{fruitcake}" in the video said he isn't an expert but there are people who spend years studying this issue, it's not a closed case after thinking about it just a little.

If anything, there is systemic \textbf{racism} against white men. Affirmative Action and quotas are a legal way for companies and universities to discriminate against white men simply based only on the fact that they are white men.

If I remember correctly it was brought in to bring the numbers for minorities up in universities because if you took poverty, crime etc. factors out it was still imbalanced towards whites. All men are created equal, so \textbf{racism} is suspected. Don't have the numbers on me but I believe in many places the numbers are still not balanced (favouring whites). It's a system to counteract the (perhaps unintentional) \textbf{racism} of recruiters. Yeah it'll lower chances for whites, but the argument is this system removes an unfair advantage they had before.\@master of keys.¬†Dunno what you're sayin but i'm just here to discuss the other side.

Look, I know this is off-topic, but I hope that I can communicate the message to you that the "victims" that society labels aren't really victims at all. This idea that certain races and genders are being targeted by systematic discrimination is ridiculous. Speaking for the US alone, we live in a \textbf{nation} that presently naturally favors minorities more because of our past history. People don't want to be labeled as racists or sexists, and will give into the narrative that blacks and women are being oppressed. If they don't, then they're told to "check their privilege" and how they should blindly believe that some sort of boogeyman oppression exists. Believe me, I've talked with these people in real life. They're people who were born in unfortunate circumstances, and blame their problems on higher powers who are out to get them because of their skin color, \textbf{gender}, etc. They make up all kinds of excuses as to why they got into drugs and crime, but they'll never admit that they themselves are to blame for their own actions. "It's not my fault! Society made me do it!" What they need is acceptance. Acceptance that life isn't fair and that their problems aren't caused by some boogeyman \textbf{racist}, but by chance, and they're just going to have to find a way how to deal with the circumstance that they were born into...Sorry for the rant at the end btw, I kind of had a bad day to be honest...\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender, Nation, Racist, Weird & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General, Gender - General, Nationality - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}5/325 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.538 \\  \hline

The notion of justice, though, is insulted in that minority offenders are more likely to be arrested for the same offences and then to receive harsher sentences, on average, than Caucasian offenders. Year in and year out, throughout our criminal justice system‚Äîpolice, prosecutors, juries, judges, all contributing to the inequality. And, for the most part, we do this without being conscious of our biases and the insidious results. That pretty much defines "systemic racial prejudice" and begs the question of "justice."~That does not address the tendency of our legislators to pass laws that mete out harsher sentences, in consequence, to minorities, e.g. sentencing laws for crack cocaine vs. powder cocaine.~Nor our tendency toward "mass incarceration," much of which is due, not to murder, but to the "War on drugs," now well past its fortieth year. This war has cost us billions upon billions of dollars in law enforcement, judicial and incarceration costs and with billions more going to foreign governments and foreign narco-traffickers, without any indication of ultimate victory, and no exit strategy. What we are doing is locking up tens of thousands of individuals‚Äîof all races‚Äîyear after year after year after year and it changes \textbf{nothing}. Well, except that the drug lords of some of our narco-trading partners have now grown powerful enough to threaten the sovereignty of their own countries and the integrity of our borders, most of which borders are not with Mexico but are ocean shores.~Nor am I much comforted, as some others seem to be, by the fact that we are not as stupid or mean-spirited as some other nations.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small +Jack O' Reilly - You mention a comparison that has been suggested by others in this thread, that \textbf{racism} in the US is not as bad as in other countries, but I think that approach is the problem we actually are discussing. It is the habit of Caucasian Americans (among which I count myself), in general, to minimize the \textbf{racism} in the US, through various rationalizations, rather than to deal with it, per se. In effect, white Americans, in general, tend to say things which mean, "it's not that bad," rather than to say, "how do we fix it?" ~Even so, it's somewhat disingenuous for white Americans to suggest we even know it's not that bad. Or, for that matter, why do we even use that justification? Does that make our \textbf{racism} OK, because it's not as bad as elsewhere? That's the point of the video: we don't deal with it and we say things like, "it's not that bad" or deny it's any sort of problem at all.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Gene Rybarczyk I understand where you're coming from, but the problem becomes that when people want to push a narrative and need to exaggerate claims and essentially mislead people into thinking it's a bigger problem than actually is, then that's an issue. If a cause lacks truth and evidence then it can risk becoming fanatical (e.g. \textbf{Black} Lives Matter).  I agree it would be much better if we could focus more on solving our problems rather than just bickering with each other.  But, it becomes difficult when people aren't giving specific policies/systems to discuss or simply lie/exaggerate the problem to further an agenda.  It's hard to combat an issue like "institutional \textbf{racism}", because it's essentially a meaningless term. I'm not saying we don't have our problems, but we need to take a more constructive approach to addressing themLastly, on the point about America being better than other countries in terms of \textbf{race} relations I'll leave you with the thoughts of \textbf{black}, liberal Harvard sociologist Orlando Patterson, who wrote: "America, while still flawed in its \textbf{race} relations ‚Ä¶ is now the least \textbf{racist} white-majority society in the world; has a better record of legal protection of minorities than any other society, white or \textbf{black}; and offers more opportunities to a greater number of \textbf{black} persons than any other society, including all of Africa."\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Race, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}7/223 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.139 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small +Jack O' Reilly - Thanks for the very thoughtful comments.~As to your quote from Dr. Patterson, I am not in a position to be able to compare the overall record of the people of the United States regarding \textbf{race} relations to that of other nations. If I were to place a bet, however, I would lean toward Dr. Patterson's assessment. Moreover, I believe that any record of better performance likely owes its existence directly to our Bill of Rights, the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments and other Constitutional provisions not enjoyed or enforced by other nations. Nonetheless, enforcing those provisions, even in the United States, is not an automatic or default position that we can assume will be in effect. It will continue to require upgrades, similar to the Voting Rights Act of 1965.~What I object to is that other respondents mentioned only that comparative performance, without any acknowledgement of the overall problem, like a man, pulled over for speeding, immediately whining to the traffic cop that other drivers were speeding even faster. That is a very \textbf{common}, and very human, form of denial used to minimize unpleasant circumstances without addressing them.~But, rather than "institutional" \textbf{racism}, what I believe we are really dealing with, everywhere and in all races, is an inherent biological tendency‚Äîhardwired, so to speak‚Äîto reject and even be hostile to other people that are not like ourselves. This is, according to my readings and studies, a propensity based in genetics, so that the less someone is like me, i.e., other races, the less accepting I would be, and that those most like me, my own family, are those most valued. I suspect further, based more on extrapolation than on any evidence, that this proclivity is not distributed evenly throughout the human population but, like other racial, \textbf{ethnic} or individual traits (e.g., eye color or height) may occur in differing degrees or standards.~That biological urge is the problem I believe to be at the base of these issues and is the factor we humans must eventually address.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Common, Ethnic, Race, Racism & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}4/346 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.156 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Gene Rybarczyk I understand, but the original commenter was pointing to the idea that America is mainly exceptional when it comes to things like \textbf{racism} and I feel a comment like that is worth shouting down because it unfairly characterizes this country as something that it's not.  But you're right to say that being not as bad as someone else shouldn't be the bar we measure ourselves by.In terms of the biological tendencies you point to, I'm sure there's some truth to that.  We do seem to be hostile to things we don't understand, and people we grow up with or identify with are probably more likely to receive favorable reactions.  However, that becomes a very hard thing to measure or account for when having political discussions and it can serve as somewhat of a green light to make assumptions about what people think, specifically in terms of \textbf{race}. That's a problem in my view. Humans aren't perfect but we're extremely intelligent creatures with the ability to think with reason.  So whatever biological tendencies we may or may not have, if we apply the right kind of open-mindedness and rational thought we've developed over time, then we'll be fine\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Race, Racism & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/200 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.0 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small +Jack O' Reilly - I see your point regarding the notion of overcoming our negative proclivities, but your view of the human \textbf{race} is somewhat more sanguine than mine. I know that we think of ourselves as an intelligent species but, to a much greater degree, we are an emotional species. I believe we behave more in response to those emotions than we do to any semblance of intelligence we might possess. More often, our intelligence is employed in service to our emotions.~I would also take exception to your description of us as "extremely" intelligent. We might be the most intelligent creatures on the planet, but we really have \textbf{nothing} to compare ourselves to by way of our type of intelligence. Saying we are more intelligent than dolphins or chimpanzees is not really saying a lot. Intelligence I will concede, but I think the jury is still out on the question of quality and degree.~I concur that the goal is not to accept the situation as it is and to deal with our limitations directly, I am just not too optimistic at our prospects in the short term and suspect we may have to experience some additional evolutionary upgrades before the problems will be resolved.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nothing, Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/209 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.957 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small +Jack O' Reilly - Your mention of our history brought to mind the fact that our recent economic recession was not really a unique circumstance for the United States. We've managed to have one of these economic collapses‚Äîknown as panics, recessions, or depressions‚Äîevery few years, right back to 1790. And almost all of them caused by short-sighted management in the financial or Investment sectors. We humans seem to make it a habit to forget enough of our history make the same mistakes over and over again. I, for one, am not anxious to resurrect hardly anything from our past‚Äîexcept maybe those golden decades when all pizza was \textbf{thin} crust pizza.~I think the whole issue of America's greatness is practically meaningless. It's not a trophy we can put on the mantle or a check we can deposit in the bank. It's just an empty catchphrase that politicians like to bandy about when they don't have anything substantial to say but just want to get the yokels worked up. ~America doesn't need to be great, it just needs to be America. And this constant urge to compare ourselves to other countries‚ÄîAmerica is the greatest country in the world!‚Äîsmacks a bit of poor self esteem. I mean, if your neighbor down the block stood out on his front lawn once a week and shouted out how he was the greatest one in the neighborhood, you'd pretty much figure he was just a loud-mouthed jerk.~If I were to say what we most need in this country, it would be more critical thinking. People allow themselves to be led around by their emotions. Some politician gets up on a soapbox and shouts that everything will be better if we elect him to office so that he can bring us back to \textbf{thin} crust pizza and that will solve all our problems.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Gene Rybarczyk I agree with a lot of that, but critical thinking does require giving yourself some credit where credit is due. As a people, there is \textbf{nothing} wise in always looking to our shortcomings and thinking they're what defines us. Yeah hubris can be off putting, but there are values, principles, and achievements that give the people of this country reason to be very proud of its history. We don't need to live in or deify the past, but acknowledging and understanding its contributions is how we can improve on the present. Otherwise, we're doomed to never improve or learn from our mistakes and achievements.Lastly, free market capitalism, when left alone, will have its peaks and valleys, but the important thing is to allow the valleys to happen and let the market recover. The only true depression we've ever had came from the mismanagement of Hoover who thought he could engineer the economy back to health, not helped by the doubling down of FDR, and that took a long time to recover from. The 2008 crisis saw similar mistakes repeated and we still haven't recovered either. The point is we're not as morally or intellectually above our past as many think.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Gene Rybarczyk I agree, that's a good way to put it.On FMC in theory, the point is that people are free to pursue their own self interests and will reap the rewards and failures of their own actions. We don't all have to be smart or reasonable, because no matter the results, you're responsible for yourself.  Which, to me, does a great deal of benefit. When people can no longer blame society for holing them back, it does motivate people to make the most out of their situations instead of blaming someone else.  That's essentially the trade off of freedom. \textbf{Nothing} is holding you back or restricting you from living your life the way you choose, but no one's guaranteeing you success. FMC is the best economic vehicle for that philosophy man has created so far.In practice, this economic system has certainly proven itself out in the past, especially here.  This country has been mainly built on that system and has produced the greatest advances and innovations in technology, medicine, energy, business, and so on, the world has ever seen. Even more importantly there's never been a system that has done more to help the little guy and bring him out what we now consider poverty into prosperity. This country also produced the greatest middle class (which was non-existent to many countries) the world has ever seen on the back of that system.  The biggest problems come in when business leaders use government (and vice versa) to distort and corrupt the marketplace for their own benefit and keep the politicians are bought off and happy for doing it. But that's a problem of corporatism, not capitalism.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!27}1/278 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.36 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Gene Rybarczyk But again, this is why government was only given a certain amount of responsibilities. The idea that government infringement is a product of FMC is self fulfilling prophecy that gives safe haven to authoritarians. If the people held the government accountable and didn't allow them stretch beyond its lawfully prescribed duties, even if it was for something we find good or helpful, then we wouldn't have these problems. The issue is most Americans have often been too caught up in this left-right ideological battle that they become willing to allow state power to expand or infringe where it shouldn't, in order to get their way.The argument about campaign contributions, that many see nowadays as legalized bribery, only manifests itself when talking about donors with lots of money. The worry is that these people are essentially buying politicians and being given favors and advantages in return, which is totally true. But there's \textbf{nothing} wrong with trying to get politicians to do what you want, that's what politics is for. These people are our representatives and they're supposed to serve our interests. If/when they don't we punish them with the loss of our votes and support. And contributing money to a campaign is an essential part of our responsibility as an electorate. "Money is the mother's milk of politics."  The problem arises when government returns their contributions with favors and alignment they aren't supposed to have the power to do.It's also a dishonest framing of the argument to make an emotional appeal when talking about people falling on hard times or needing help and painting libertarian philosophy as one that scoffs at people's misfortune and chalks it all up to laziness. This line of argument is often on the basis that it's immoral to allow people to live in poverty while others are well off. The fact is it isn't moral to steal from some to give to others just because they're poor.  And the kicker is that these government programs don't even work to lift people out of poverty and often leave them caught in a cycle of dependency that's hard to escape from.  Free markets and charity have done more to help people in those situations throughout our history than government ever has. And even today, research shows that in America if you don't want to be permanently poor you only need to do 3 things: finish high school, get a job \& hold it, and don't have a kid out of wedlock. That's it.  Don't get me wrong I'm all for helping people, but we should be free to make those decisions for ourselves and not coerced by government.Finally, I think we agree that government and the private sector working in symbiosis is not a good thing, but that isn't affected by allowing capitalism to run wild. It's only when politicians want in on the action (for good or bad intentions) and make promises to the people in order to get what it wants.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}1/500 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.2 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small While I certainly understand your points and agree that there is some systemic \textbf{racism} in the US, the reality is that White Americans are not entirely or even primarily to blame for the struggles of \textbf{African} Americans.  Even with affirmative action policies in place for decades, \textbf{African} Americans still struggle.  Even while another minority, Asian Americans, has great success, \textbf{African} Americans still struggle.  I would like to point out that there are significant differences in family structure \& values within the \textbf{African} American community that put them at a significant disadvantage before any societal \textbf{racism} factors are taken into account.  For example, let's take a close look at the percentage of \textbf{African} American children growing up in single-parent households.  A whopping 67 of \textbf{African} American children grow up in single-parent households.  This puts them at a severe disadvantage growing up, with a lack of mentorship and guidance that could help put them on the track to success.  In contrast, 42 of hispanic/latino children, 25 of non-hispanic white children, and 16 of asian children grow up in single-parent households.  Asian Americans are known as the "model minority" precisely because they have close-knit, supportive families with parents who instill in their children the value of education and hard work.  If \textbf{African} American families valued family structure, education, and hard work in the way that the Asian Americans do, I believe that they could realize their true potential.  Asian Americans weren't granted any major favors by majority-White Americans, and yet they have had outstanding success.  (see: Children in Single-Parent Families by \textbf{Race}, Kids Count Data Center, A Project of the Annie E. Casey Foundation)To conclude:  The problems endemic to the \textbf{African} American community are not solely or even primarily caused by White Americans, nor are they solely or even primarily solvable by White Americans.  While White Americans can increase funding for inner city schools to help \textbf{African} Americans, they cannot solve the problems regarding poor family structure and values endemic to the \textbf{African} American community.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African, Race, Racism & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}13/333 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.904 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small +The Grumps Well, I guess the difference is just which sources are cited. Sadly of course many people do not actually look at the sources (or indeed the statements of the people citing them) when it's for a view that conflicts with their own. I've been trying my best to get better at this, I know I'm definitely guilty of it myself, but it's actually served to make my own convictions firmer in some cases, knowing that I've actually given the counterpoint a fair assessment.One big thing is to actually look critically at statistics and think about what they actually mean, cause you can say the same thing in different ways and use it to justify opposite statements. Like for instance I once argued with someone who wanted to stop all immigration to Sweden because he could link an article of some vaguely \textbf{racist} blog saying "immigrants commit twice as many crimes as swedes". I researched a bit and found a report from the criminal institute where it said something like 0.5 of citizens born in Sweden are suspected of a crime in their lifetime, and 1 of citizens born abroad... So the title in the article was almost true (even if being a suspect is a very different thing from being guilty of a crime), but the implications of the satement, that immigrants are dangerous criminals, was obviously pretty damn flimsy.So yes, everyone can cite sources as much as they want, but the actual contents of those sources is what matters. Of course the sad part is that some people just will not read sources anyway, and just take any statements they like at face value, but if more people actually take the time to scrutinize what they read and hear, and try to talk to people spreading or believing in untruth and plain meanness, hopefully stuff can change for the better...\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/315 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.317 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small +beepybeetle I work in college admissions and that is factually incorrect. First and foremost, AA isn't actually instituted at the rates that it should be. Second, it definitely does not hurt white kids, in fact schools are often afraid of being accused of admitting \textbf{black} students only because of affirmative action, and tend to have stricter guidelines for admitting students of color. Statistically those who benefit the most from AA are actually white women (who these programs were originally created for)MOST IMPORTANTLY we need to acknowledge that college was never a meritocracy. EVER. Academic performance is very much linked to income in the U.S. so when you have policies that force particular people into poverty (slavery, \textbf{jim c\textbf{row}}, \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} lining, school to prison pipeline etc.) they will live in poor areas, and where you go to school is determined geographically. And schools are partially supported by citizens taxes. So you end up with poor schools, and students who are often also working. Which kind of makes it hard to have amazing grades, especially when 10 people are sharing one textbook, and teachers are being laid off. Also note that it has already been established that the SAT and ACT are both sexist and \textbf{racist}, and most importantly classist, which is why you might have noticed many universities going test optional, and Hampshire College going completely test \textbf{blind}. This affects all poor people in the states which is why there are parts of affirmative action that pay attention to income. Also remember that because of aforementioned policies, that pocs particularly \textbf{black} people are disproportionately effected by poverty.So if a student from a poor area is managing to do reasonable well despite the circumstances they are faced with, imagine what they could do with actual opportunity?!AND WHAT IS MOST INTERESTING is that in all these discussions about affirmative action, you never see people discussing the real, and actually unfair affirmative action: LEGACIES. you know the people who get in based (in some cases) entirely off of the fact that people in their family went to an institution. and this is part of keeping rich people rich, because with a degree you earn more, so compare that to families who were barred from higher education for hundreds of years? ALSO straight up, colleges are more likely to accept students whose families or associates seem likely to donate to the school.So if you want to talk about affirmative action, talk about that.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Blind, Crow, Jim Crow, Racist, Red & \cellcolor{green!5} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Ethnicity - Native-American, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}8/412 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.942 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Racism certainly does exist in the US, but that last bit John said about economic inequality is a HUGE factor when it comes to incarceration rates.Yes, white people historically have had better inheritances and wealthier families, and the reason that economic gap exists today is because of \textbf{racism}.  Plain and simple.  However, I'm hesitant to think that the justice system is biased towards blacks... Blacks don't have access to the types of defensive resources that whites have.  I believe this is due to the economic gap.  A middle-class white person MORE THAN LIKELY knows SOMEONE who knows a lawyer, or perhaps they have a lawyer in their family.  That connection will guarantee the white person to a better chance at getting a lighter sentence compared to an impoverished \textbf{black} person who doesn't know any lawyers and doesn't have the money.  Again, this is most certainly because of HISTORICAL \textbf{racism}, and that a couple generations ago blacks didn't have the same rights that whites had.  I will argue, given enough time for that historical \textbf{racism} to be left behind, and blacks continuing to have access to the same rights that whites have, this incarceration gap (and the economic gap) will decrease.  It will take a long time for the damage to be undone, and programs like affirmative action are needed to continue to give blacks a boost to have the same success rate as whites have always had.  I don't think the justice system is biased towards whites, but I think the justice system is corrupt in the sense that money talks and who you know matters.  Blacks, at this point, are not able to play the system in the way that whites are.  Is the justice system flawed?

Investigators collect as much evidence as they can to prove their case, but in the end, the best the jury can do is decide if the evidence is strong enough to convict. Therefore, sometimes the best they can do is rule on whether they think the person I guilty or innocent. This system is far from perfect and it is possible to tamper with evidence, racial or \textbf{gender} biases may come into play, and sometimes corruption completely takes over. However, no one can possibly know the whole truth so even in a perfect system, there will always be innocent people who are convicted and guilty people who are set free.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small +Heath Blake It's not that simple. Crime isn't a symptom of \textbf{race} its the outcome of poverty. People who don't have a legitimate way to make ends meet turn to crime. That happens even in white impoverished neighborhoods. We have set up a system where inner city schools don't have all the resources they need to educate their students well, because we break up districts by taxes, and those kids then can't get jobs to reinvest in their communities and families because of that. But that was cause by two things Housing discrimination that happened until the 80s making \textbf{ethnic} ghettos, and white flight because white people didn't want to live near \textbf{black} people. That leaves \textbf{black} and Hispanics in a feedback loop that produces generational poverty. Affirmative action was made to attempt to remedy that problem I don't think that its the best way to do that, but that is the solution that people felt would hurt people the least. Also you aren't less likely to get highered at a middle class job, companies that use affirmative action tend to higher only a few minorities. Like that's a straight up myth. Also \textbf{Black} Lives Matter is about all lives mattering. But because \textbf{Black} lives are culturally treated like they matter less than white lives the slogan came about. This is a tired saying but its kind of like the slogan "Save the Rain forest" isn't saying "Rain forests matter more" or "fuck other forests" it's just noting that rain forests are being depleted more quickly than other types of forests.

I think many whites are also feeling a lot social and economic pains such as low pay, under employment, long work hours, and lower standard of living.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Alright, mate, not trying to argue with your point too much here, because I agree with you on the need to increase awareness of these terrible truths. However, I notice something in your language that is highly questionable:You said at the beginning, around 0:13, 75 of white US citizens don't think that there is racial bias in the criminal justice system and just over 50 don't think that \textbf{racism} is a significant problem in the US--emphasis on THINK. At about 3:21, you say "but do deny the existence of systemic \textbf{racism}..."Not thinking something and actively denying are two totally different things, mate. There's no such thing as passively denying something (considering that it is a synonym with verbs such as contradict), whereas there is such a thing as passively thinking something--it's called being unaware. Now, some may say that the differentiation is minutia, but hear me out on this: a lot of these white US citizens are pushed farther away from the issue by this sort of accusatory language, because they don't feel as if they have been denying something, but you are telling them they have been.Just as white people should be significantly more open-minded about this topic, people really need to keep in mind that the audience is, fundamentally, white people, because they are the ones who can fix their thinking. This is an important issue, and it shouldn't be trivialized, but it also shouldn't be inflamed into a \textbf{race} war by hostile language on either side--in this case, yours.Cheers!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Race, Racism & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/256 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.172 \\  \hline

Before the popularization of slave trade Africa had some of the best universities and had it continued without the slave trade and conquering of whites it would not be in the bad shape it is now. Whites convinced and gave incentive those in Africa to go to war and obtain slaves. Yes they had slaves in Africa but hardly as much as Europeans had, as they didn't have large cash crop colonies. They conquered territory then when they withdrew control it spiraled into chaos.

You do understand that is younger than many people are right? 50 years is in no way a short period of time. The japan comparison is wrong in many different ways. Firstly you're comparing people from a single country to an entire skin color. There are 41 times as many blacks as there are Japanese people. The oppression of the \textbf{African} american community in america has been going on for 300 years, the Japanese only a few decades. In no way do I mean to minimize their struggles but they were doing well before they were interned, and they never need to do what blacks had to do simply to obtain basic rights.

Police can punish those who commit crime, but they don't stop the amount. The money spent on extra police in these areas would be better spent in creating opportunities.

I assume he is an \textbf{African} American and think he must experience \textbf{racism} like all \textbf{African} Americans do. Feeling the shame of my ancestors, I decide to talk to him hoping to reaffirm that non-\textbf{racist} white people exist.  That action is \textbf{racist}.

I must now change my world view to compensate for the fact that I cannot fully accept a generalization to be true.  The action of making generalization is essential to cognitive functions. In leu of information, we must still make decisions. However, the act of accepting a generalization is the cause of so many problems in the world.The primary issue is that generalizations are made for a good reason, so we are tempted to accept them. We say stuff like "i'm not \textbf{racist}, but its stupid how \textbf{black} people have large rims on their cars, speak too loudly in public, and have m\&m logos bedazzled on the back pockets of their jeans." Today we think that discrimination is the primary indicator of \textbf{racism}, so if you aren't actively discriminating then you think you are not \textbf{racist}.

I think it is sensible for a \textbf{racist} individual to only avoid those of his \textbf{race} because he won't exactly get along well with those he discriminates against and so would be happy to allow this from a government perspective. The morality is pointless to talk about here. If such discrimination leads to lower performance such a company should succumb to it's rivals. If the system survives there may well be something to it. I think that racial selection can be incredibly useful in some situations. In police forces having more african-american officers may help in areas where there are high numbers of african-americans in the same way that one chooses female voices for female helplines. I want to allow the potential for discrimination so \textbf{race} may become a useful and pertinent tool where it might yield interesting results because where it clearly doesn't do so, those businesses will suffer.Becoming a government that mandates what one can and cannot select on the basis on is to deprive the world of the works of a limited perspective and the scenarios in which people can really be helped by those with a similar background to them so I defend you point Hammer but would also say you have to be mighty liberal to do so.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Race, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}4/275 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.455 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Victor GarciaUnfortunately this video is neither the proof nor the argument that needs to be made for change. The debates concerning \textbf{race} are those of two halves, those who don't believe that the influence of active or implicit racial discrimination is a thing and those who do; and those who do acknowledge it arguing with those who ask them to tread carefully in what hey choose to do about it. Hopefully you will count me as one the latter :). The first statement I would like to make is about implicit \textbf{racism}. Real commendable studies have been performed about topics from emotive perception between races to even who white women are more and less attracted too as they approach ovulation, so I won't be denying the existence of even this most biological form of implicit \textbf{racism}. In a America there are also real signs of explicit \textbf{racism} in the form of hate groups and hateful speakers from an eclectic set of backgrounds. What the above video stands in the territory of is the muddy water of this debate. Most of the statistics are impossibly difficult to detract from social conditions, expressed eloquence and even economic background; and so even if I agreed vehemently with you that \textbf{racism} was the main component in these cases of disadvantage I couldn't prove it on the above evidence. Instead I will simply say be careful the the heavy handed approach, when a government takes issues of racial distribution into it's own hands what it actually is encouraging is mandated population representative racial discrimination/selection. The disadvantages many social groups in America face should be dealt with as issues ignorant of \textbf{race}. If one supports \textbf{black} peoples social mobility then they need ensure that support services you have in America are distributed fairly and effectively to these people, but not moreso to these people than non disadvantaged groups on the basis of \textbf{race}. Economic deprivation in schools could be the key resource perhaps. When balancing systems is done with a heavy hand you end up with real issues because \textbf{race} becomes a construct with impact when in reality it is without one. In Britian the most deprived group of individuals are white, working class britons yet we still here cries of \textbf{racism}. We have 22¬† \textbf{black} university makeup and 13 population with still calls for a bigger percentage representation. \textbf{Black} has become synonymous with educationally deprived at the expense of another demographic group and in doing so issues of distribution continue.¬† The stats can tell us that there are forces at work that are negative and destructive to social cohesion, but let us not rush to a solution that will re-draw \textbf{racism} rather than move towards making \textbf{race} a redundant term via judging its effective us\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Race, Racism & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}14/461 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.037 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Tis not I am afraid. It doesn't separate the problem from implied economic class and also doesn't point to a directed policy against those of any particular descent. The is incredibly pertinent because one can also point to the effects of implicit \textbf{racism}, which should it be held responsible for decisions like this suggests that a re-balancing in those communities is rather penniless. It also doesn't resolve issues of recruitment until departments are re-balanced, but to invest in minority communities is to have this problem persist just with a new group. In Britain advantage based policies directed on a principle of \textbf{race} not of economic need has led to whit working class males being just as economically inhibited as many minorities were 10 years ago.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Race, Racism & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/125 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.6 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The study as far as I am aware has no directly referenced evidence of the faith of those judging the evidence as such. Therefore what remains impossible is to locate the source of bias in selection, even at the lowest semantic level if I choose to it only biases against people with names of the sorts provided.Nonetheless the case I am making is not one of stating any selection biases do or do not exist but in where with in the psyche you attribute these difference. Taken as signs of institutional \textbf{racism} the course of action may well be promulgation of affected communities successes. If the racial issue is seen as implicit or developmental then the issue not only remains as you redistribute resources to affected racial communities because family structures will remain primarily same \textbf{race} selection for the foreseeable future. Furthermore this is¬† assuming a behaviorist development of racial bias rather than a¬† biologically encoded discriminatory system.To even consider your statements of solution is to ignore the possibility that this \textbf{racism} may not only be case by case but also a basic developmental problem of exposure that all humans have the capacity to develop. The evidence of bias in the work place doesn't disprove this and studies in IAT's and empathy tests between different races (and even romantic attraction studies and partner success rates) suggest such a mechanic should be at play. So your solution is at best one of proportionally enforced \textbf{racism}, tasking the state with not only asking one to benefit on a non directly related factor for any time is not ending \textbf{racism}, it is awarding different social groups within the time with different racial advantages, at the whim of elected governments (ones in America that currently have a candidate who promotes whether faithfully or not inhibition of Islamic people's ability to move). Your moves award characters who you might disagree with immensely the ability to on a popular mandate redistribute advantage.To put a cherry on this mire of affirmative action equality of opportunity (as mandated by a state) you now have evidence from Britain and the USA the social mobility isn't even improving as redistribution advantage packages are awarded in both nations (the major point here being that the conclusions are still being refuted but to assume either answer is correct at this point is acting without precedent)  [LINK] My question will never be one of whether \textbf{racism} exists, but one of asking how we avoid the mistakes of the past movements and similar movements. I don't want another movement to see redrawing lines rather than resolving and facing uncomfortable issues as a solution. It is significant that Islamophobia is rampant in European nations even with larger, more distributive, more select minority friendly policies, and so too do many have problems with there majority \textbf{race} working class individuals social mobility. The target can change so easily if one doesn't resolve the issue, and sometimes the scope of the argument needs to be beyond, get rid of x statistic we don't like.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Race, Racism & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}7/509 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.375 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small +mon dd I didn't go through the other responses here so I apologize if I reiterate something someone else has said.Yes of course \textbf{black} individuals can be and sometimes are \textbf{racist}. The same is true for white, Latino, Asian, native American, etc. individuals. However, a large part of the \textbf{race} problem in America is linked to the fact that systematic \textbf{racism} is built into systems of our country and often despite individuals not intending to be \textbf{racist}, it still happens and harms people. Furthermore, while \textbf{black} communities can have systematic and built in biases based on \textbf{race}, a much larger portion of society today is based upon white cultures and leadership partly do to the fact that there are more Caucasians than any other group in the US and partly because a long tradition of \textbf{racism} set up the system which has never done away with its \textbf{racist} inter-workings. This all feeds into a system that is effectively rigged against minority groups in general. It's not to say \textbf{racism} doesn't effect whites or that other groups can't be \textbf{racist} or even that most white people are intentionally \textbf{racist}, rather it says that the systems in place systematically hurt more blacks for example than whites in disproportionate amounts that cannot be accounted for in any other way. That is the basis of America's \textbf{race} problem.Also, at risk of being used as an example of someone "on the losing team," I am a straight Caucasian middle class male. I am part of one of the most systematically privileged groups in the USA today. However, thanks to my family and friends I am aware of and opposed to these systematic biases despite the fact that I unwittingly benefit from them.

These cannot be accounted for by random chance because your argument would suggest opposite results from these. While not ALL aspects of the system show clear and definitive signs of \textbf{racism}, many do and that is the problem we face. While some of this can be attributed to individuals, the individuals are part of the system and are meant to be unbiased.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Race is a relatively new ideology on the human timeline. Modern \textbf{racism} helps justify the oppression and slavery of a perceived inferior person, like having a hooked nose, epicanthic folds or dark skin.If the other person is dehumanised, made to be different from the \textbf{racist}, it's easier to treat the non-human badly.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Last thing: People should be cold and statistically driven when discussing any facet of truth or they risk succumbing to biases in opinion based on uncalled-for, and typically \textbf{blind} emotional input. As many many many studies have shown, emotion almost always leads to inaccurate conclusions. When discussing and establishing facts, we must abandon our humanity. Decisions on the other hand should consider both fact and humanity. Forming opinions which cite emotions as a part of a logical argument invalidates the argument because it introduces bias. So, time to pose a question that I have a hard time answering: Why does \textbf{racism} exist in the first place? Slavery is almost completely unheard of in the modern world, yet \textbf{racism} lives on. Is \textbf{racism} the product of natural selection? Is it inherently wrong to have preferences in the genes that you would like to see carried on past this generation? What about in skin tones that you find appealing? If that is simply another physical feature, is it wrong to enjoy one physical feature more than another? Why? If each person is entitled to their own opinions, is it wrong for them to have a preference for what color palate they would like to see when they look at a person? Base your conclusion on logic alone, and while it remains wrong to discriminate for any reason, the reason that people become \textbf{racist} is much easier to understand.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Blind, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}5/236 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.119 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small A couple pieces of constructive (hopefully) criticism which, if taken into account, may increase the accuracy of this video, because I think it is very well made, agree with a lot of what you have to say (if you accurately interpreted the data that you are referencing), and want to help make it more trustworthy.Intro:What where the surveys you based this on? (Hyperlinks?) Were they conducted accurately? How do you know? Have you examined the methods sections? What was the sample rate? Was it a random sample? Was it a double \textbf{blind} experiment? Is the data relevant according to the previous criteria? Is the data statistically significant? Where the questions asked asked in a manner that imposes a bias to respond in one direction on the survey participant? Are you qualified to be making claims about these pieces of data? Are you representing them with a bias? How does the viewer know?Define: "Racial Bias" \& "Significant Problem" according to what the studies stated. Do the studies listed make overt conclusions stating anything overtly related to the topic of this video?Data Section:Point :1. Valid. This is a trend in the data that has been collected, however, how do you know that this is based on \textbf{race} alone and not other tendencies? The gap has been widening, but is \textbf{racism} causing this or are there other factors that aren't being considered? the relation ship between \textbf{racism} and this point is not logically valid as it is not presented with sufficient data to suggest that \textbf{race} is the issue. What happens to this figure when you include the fact that people from impoverished areas tend to be more likely to repeat offend and that it is more likely for minorities to be from impoverished areas? I think this point was not considered with enough depth to draw a link to \textbf{racism}. If you can't prove a point, you really should not include it.2. Sources? Valid from what I've read, although why has yet to be established by data. So the link directly to \textbf{racism} is a huge stretch. Perhaps it is less likely that whites will be caught for or suspected of using drugs, but then again, that doesn't explain why \textbf{ethnic} minorities are more likely to be caught for it. It doesn't mean that the entire legal system is stacked against ethic minorities if there is one trend that pushes the data in that direction. Perhaps there is an overtly obvious presence of drugs in ethnically diverse areas that make it more likely to be caught. Maybe officers and enforcers are trying to clean up areas that are actually in need of a little legal attention. While all people may use drugs, if other crimes are being committed in the area, thus meriting police attention, and an individual is in that area who is carrying drugs, wouldn't there be a higher likelihood that that individual would be caught? Once again, correlation does not equal causation and this a really vague statistic to base this assumption upon.3. \textbf{African} Americans are more likely to be stopped by police. Without including information about the sample taken, the areas in which the data was taken, or the sample size, it is hard to establish if this trend is accurately represented here, thereby making the argument that you are attempting to make off of it irrelevant because, if it is in fact a study of inner city regions or ethnically diverse neighborhoods, or even run-down neighborhoods, the likelihood of who is stopped is correlated to many more factors than \textbf{race} so it would be hard to establish whether or not this trend really exists. To conduct this survey without bias and establish that is is solely the factor of \textbf{race} that is effecting whether someone is pulled over, the survey would have to examine the sample of cars pulled over where each representative \textbf{race} in the area was equally likely to commit a crime or traffic infraction and be conducted in an environment where each \textbf{race} is equally represented in the population of cars on the road to ensure that the random sample would be equal (just a likely for each \textbf{race} to be driving \& same likelihood of traffic infraction). Without this information, we are missing a huge piece of the information critical to establish if the police were pulling people over on the basis of \textbf{race}, or on the basis of traffic infraction likelihood that correlates to \textbf{race}, because if read without this information, and assuming a random sample and equal police presence in each area of sampling, this study could just suggest that \textbf{African} Americans are more simply more likely to commit a traffic infraction in front of a police officer. 4. Hit rate to find illegal contraband is higher among white people. Ok... what does this have to do with them being pulled over? There are a lot of reasons to pull a person over that have \textbf{nothing} to do with the suspicion of possession of illegal contraband, which you need a warrant to find by the way. When you know your rights, there is no reason to even be suspected of having contraband. Additionally, if you are not being detained, you are legally allowed to leave whenever you want. Maybe there are other reasons why \textbf{African} Americans are more likely to be pulled over. it is jumping to conclusions to immediately assume \textbf{racism} without data that points very very clearly at that being the only possible cause. (not to say it isn't, cause that is entirely possible)5. Easy refutation. Perhaps this data suggests that \textbf{African} Americans are more likely to leave DNA evidence or commit crimes which can be tried by DNA evidence. Once again, data states something about \textbf{African} Americans, not directly about \textbf{racism}. Perhaps whites are just so incredibly stupid that they leave huge trails when they commit crimes such that juries are in no need of DNA evidence to come to the conclusion that they are guilty. Once again, this does indicate a trend, but it doesn't point to the cause being \textbf{racism}. Yes, \textbf{racism} exists, but data that states something with a racial correlation does not equate automatically to \textbf{racism} as its cause.6. \textbf{Black} kids are more likely to be tried as adults. Ok, but once again, why? Discuss how this points to \textbf{racism} as the root cause of the issue. It's a great point, and one possible conclusion is that it is caused by \textbf{racism}, so take the steps to show why or no one has any right to assert that it does.7. Blacks are more likely to commit multiple crimes, so regardless of the crime committed, once again a crucial piece of the puzzle left out in coming to the conclusion of this statistic being that everyone is \textbf{racist}.8. So a white person can't be called Jamal and an \textbf{African} American person can't be called Brendan? There is usually a \textbf{race} and \textbf{gender} section on applications like this, were those all filled out the same as well? If yes, that only indicates that people should probably be considerate of what they are naming their children.9. Yep. But once again, even if all of these studies are correct, please indicate how they point to specifically \textbf{racism}. Perhaps there is simply something that is legitimately different between people of different \textbf{ethnicity} beyond their skin tone that is preventing specific employers from hiring them such as their demeanor or maybe their dress choices during interviews. Their apparent level of professionalism? Maybe there is something that these studies could do to further isolate things that minorities can do to help them have a better chance at getting jobs. Just show how this isn't true and you can then say, okay, yes, this one study points to \textbf{racism} as a factor in hiring.10. The areas you mention are defended because of the way that public education works. If a school cant meet quota or students aren't interested in taking a particular class, the program is often cut. Inner city and impoverished schools often have fewer teachers per student as well, making it less likely that students will be able to be able to come to teachers with questions and less likely that teachers will have the patience for them. The education is kind of special case in that the entire thing is messed up no matter who you are, but especially for kids who come from impoverished areas which are more likely to be loaded with \textbf{ethnic} diversity.At about the 3:00 mark you did a very good job of tying things together and from there on, thumbs up.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I do believe \textbf{racism} is a problem, and this is from a white male upper class perspective, but I find that many of my \textbf{african} American friends care less about school than my other friends (white, hispanic, asian). We all go to the top private school in the state, and all have qualified to get there. There are exceptions to both of those groups, but I believe that from a white perspective, \textbf{black} people look like they care less about education and jobs. Obviously, this is not true, but when stereotypes are in play, it is hard to separate reality from urban legend (kinda like Zodiac signs and horoscopes). I think that \textbf{black} people look like they'd rather try and get one of 100 or so jobs in the NBA than as a computer programmer.

However, the Reagan administration, which is arguably a major point in the War on (some) Drugs, saw the two treated DRASTICALLY differently.

Granted, this has been reduced to 18:1, but that's still a major disparity. The significance?

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small +DJ Sapien-The fact of the matter over (in part, I guess) just why \textbf{racism} persists just goes all the way back to the systemic and institutional \textbf{racism} that has never fully gone away. Slavery was abolished in 1865 but it couldn't fix the people who believed slavery still needed to exist and \textbf{black} people were inferior, sub par humans who didn't deserve equal rights, nor could it heal the wounds inflicted by slavery, nor all the people who had grown up with it. Institutional (and often legal such as segregation) \textbf{racism} flourished in part because the people who had grown up with these hostile, \textbf{racist}, disgusting behaviors instilled it into a new generation, who only proceeded to pass it to the next generation, and so on and so forth.Finally, in 1965, \textbf{black} people were given the legal right to vote (100 years too late and is currently being ripped apart and deregulated as well) and ever since then, there has been a slow but steady climb towards better equality as newer generations grow up learning from their parents to respect others and treat others with respect. However, Southern states where families don't tend to move around as much and often grow up in pretty much the same area for generations will often pass on their ideals to the newer generation, and since those ideals are far more "homogenized," they will stick and stick hard.And when it comes to the corrupt police system in our country, police are a very tight knit community where people also don't move around as much, they'll spend their lives as a cop and live in the same area, and often family members will decide to go into the same field as well, to where the \textbf{racist} cops will very easily pass on their ideals to another generation to where the system is so mired with blood (figuratively and literally) to where they clearly see minorities as inferior subhumans who deserve every torture, possibly death, that they get, that these people somehow "deserve" this and it's so ingrained and wound into the system, often, these police don't realize any better (not that it's an excuse, it's just what they believe and on top of being trained to deal with suspects as enemies of war and turning police into soldiers). People have to learn to be better people in particular for \textbf{racism} to decay, systemic \textbf{racism} needs to be examined far more closely and we need to take steps on how to help people learn to be better individuals. You can't force people to change but you can encourage people to and you have to teach people young basic compassion and empathy to live a good quality of life and treat others with a good quality of life.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}9/463 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.944 \\  \hline

The (Roman) Catholic church as I said before hold many non-biblical ideas; and held even more before one of their monks -Martin Luther picked up his Bible and started to read Romans. But more basic Bible doctrine later if you're interested.¬†I'm sure you couldn't be serious in what you said next, that the butterfly chose to have white wings. You aren't going to tell me you chose your height, or eye color,  or your hair color (natural color not what ever you die it) are you?? Agian, I don't want to sound mean, I'm sure you are just repeating things you have heard. And what's wrong with that; everything any of us knows we learned from someone else.  So let me share something with you. You mentioned a week ago DNA supporting evolution,  molecules-to-man. Francis Crick the Nobel Prize winning co-discoverer of DNA and an evolutionist said, "An honest man, armed with all the knowledge available to us now, could only state that in some sense, the origin of life appears at the moment to be almost a miracle, so many are the conditions which would have to have been satisfied to get it going." His solution was Panspermia - life was transported to earth from another solar system.  He saw that life from nonlife to impossible to take place so he pushed the problem off to some other place. Ironically this is what many evolutionists claim Christians and Jews do. We have a mystery so we invent a god. But we didn't He made us and gave us a book. Crick's Little Green Men from the other solar system sent no book. Crick was obviously a very intelligent man certainly more intelligent than me. His problem isn't intelligence it is that he closed his eyes tight to the truth in front of him. Another Nobel prize winning Darwinian scientist, George Wald in his work The Origin of Life, said, "Most modern biologists, having reviewed with satisfaction the downfall of the spontaneous generation hypothesis (life from non-life per Darwinian evolution), yet unwilling to accept the alternative belief in special creation are left with \textbf{nothing}. I think a scientist has no choice but to approach the origin of life through spontaneous generation. " And, "One has only to contemplate the magnitude of this task to concede spontaneous generation is impossible. Yet here we are, as a result I believe in spontaneous generation."  The man know evolution can't be true and yet he believes it because he refuses to believe in the Creator he knows must exist. He is not stupid he is willfully \textbf{blind}. one more thing, most people like the idea of no Creator because it means no moral law, but it also means you have no purpose. If no one made you for a purpose you have none. You can invent one for yourself but why what will it mean? I can assure you Crazyninja, that you were made in the image of the Creator God who made you to show you His everlasting lovingkindness. These brilliant men I mentioned shut their eyes to what they knew to be true. Christianity is a reasonable faith. God in the book of Isaiah said come let us reason together (that's in the \textbf{old} Testament). He welcomes your inquiry.  Another man who thought Christians stupid set out to prove it; he did a bunch of research and the result was he became a believer. His name is Josh McDowell and the results of his research is 2 volumes called "Evidence that demands a verdict." Whether you  grab those 2 books or pick up a Bible if just pray and ask God to reveal Himself to you, He will if you are really are looking. It is a promise He made. And He always keeps His promises. If you screw your eyes shut then they will be shut.

White people have white privilege. There. I'm white, I have white privilege. It's so asinine to even hypothetically argue about its nonexistence that it boggles me how so many people are ignorant enough to even try to. We live in a world catered to lighter skin and less melanin, it's undeniable.Running hand-in-hand with this is if \textbf{racism} runs "both ways". Yes, it does. Does that mean white people are subjugated and marginalized to even a fraction of other ethnicities? Fuck no. \textbf{Racism} is any stance, action or mindset that distinguishes races so as to label one inferior or superior to another. If you're \textbf{black} and hate all white people, or vice versa, then you're a \textbf{racist}; if you're Chinese and hate all Japanese, or vice versa, then you're a \textbf{racist}; if you are x and you hate all of y, or vice versa, then you are a \textbf{racist}. Note that I'm using 'hate' to mean look down on or direct animosity towards people of another \textbf{race} regardless of who that person is as an individual.\textbf{Racism} isn't the only problem in the world, but it undoubtedly is one of the most important, looming issues that needs to be addressed right now. So just love each other, people. I know this sounds kind of hypocritical coming from a white guy, but society is made up of people and we only need to reach a tipping point before compassion overcomes our current system.Please, I welcome criticism of anything I've written above.

So let's ignore \textbf{race} entirely? 200 years later, we have 3-4 races remaining. 400, we have no actual racial identity, we're a single globalized culture with little variety in hair, eye, and skin color. One \textbf{race}, wrapped up with a nice, tidy bow. Now consider a world where we respect our differences, don't discriminate against one another, where there's places like America for intermixing but unique races have a right to exist independently among themselves; we are many cultures, perspectives, we come in all shapes, colors, and sizes and we can all communicate amongst one another freely, sharing ideas and beliefs, adapting them to our own individual cultures in a beautiful human tapestry.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Evan GrayIt's good that you're dating a Vietnamese girl, being a White man it's your duty to spread our genes as much as you can. I do the same. Think of the history and invention we've inspired, imagine a world without the European. Intermixing doesn't increase genetic diversity, traits are lost over time and races are wiped out. Truly increasing genetic diversity would be creating protected subsections where specific races were allowed to intermix and that unique genetic line would be then preserved as it's own \textbf{race}. I'm glad you agree that cultural diversity is important, but so is racial diversity. People argue that the difference in genetics between races is too small to be relevant, but truly it's massive. To give you an idea, we share 50 of our DNA with bananas. 95 with chimps. The sometimes less than 1 difference can mean the neurons in our brains are arranged totally different, muscle structures like fast twitch vs slow twitch altered, our rates of infant development completely changed, and many other unique traits that give us genetic diversity, all that could be lost overtime to uncontrolled intermixing. How to end it is simple, in China minority groups have their genetic diversity protected. \textbf{African} countries are occupied largely by Africans, though that will soon change with a growing and soon-to-be migrating Asian population. Some tribes in South America and East Asia are allowed to live in isolation from encroaching populations. In Mexico there's even laws against immigrating populations that might threaten their racial composition. But all White countries are open to immigration, Whites are breeding less than ever, adopting more often from the 3rd world, barraging ourselves with 'White Guilt' born of a new sense of social awareness awakened following WWII.

You'll always be a mix between primitive tribal islanders and drunken Anglo-saxons, one of the last European populations to civilize; that's pretty low-tier. No wonder you're so butt hurt about Europeans, your mom must have got rammed so bad you're still feeling it. ;) ;) ;) Extra winky faces for you. ;)"So you only looked at the frequency of battles? If you read anything at all you would have noticed that chinese didn't show the weapon improvement europeans had because the main enemies they faced were nomadic. By the time the chinese actually needed guns, they decided it was better to just buy them off of europeans instead of going through the same process they did. You're right you did dominate the rest of the world but now sub sahran africas economy is growing and so is their average IQ, much faster than the white countries. It's easy to see from your comment that you are not only a homo, but ¬†you are also obsessed with me. It really shows how much i've made you angry by the fact that you're stalking my comment history and making incorrect mom jokes( my mom was white she preferred bigger non white cocks like MOST WHITE WOMEN) The funny thing is, is that im actually GLAD IM NOT FULLY WHITE Most white people i meet get sick much too easy and are not very intelligent. Not only am i smarter than any full blooded white person i have met i am also better looking. In fact the only people i have met that are smarter than me, were native american. I just love the fact that your white women salivate over me because i am mixed. Not only are you making white people look bad but you are making racists look bad. Jeez i thought you would at least have some good material but, no. What should i expect form a white person though? Your whole argument is just going to be \textbf{racist} mom jokes and tired ole "jewsdidit" cliche's. I can already see it the next thing you're gonna say is that i am inferior and i should sterilize myself, plus my mom is a whore and blacks are stupid. How cliche can you be?EDIT: in conclusion White people are not the sole creators of modern society and only had a part in building the world around us, not only are colder environments not harsher than hot ones, they may also even be easier to live in.

If you're referencing Africa, mind you that your car is barely moving and even then it's us that are providing you the basics. Who pays for your schools, your food and water? White people. Millions go to that shit every year. Still, you folks are trying to desperately come to our lands to leech off of our greatness on your shitty little rafts that sink in the Mediterranean. Good riddance. I'm all for your nations becoming something, so you could go back to where you belong. I wouldn't mind the collapse of Europe either, our current society is so rotten it could use a little reality check."I was born in the USA i eat american food and practice american culture i speak amercan english and have friends of all taht are american too. So it shouldn't surprise anyone when i say i could care less about cultures across the otherside of the world.Just because my dna says im filipino and irish doesnt mean anything. I grew up in the usa and I act like an american. Also Sorry to \textbf{bum} you out but ¬†\textbf{african} immigrants Do better than east asian ones. In fact Africans who had ¬†immigrants ancestors back about 2 to 3 generations have been known to score 90 and above on IQ tests. Suggesting the gap is easily mutable."Middle-East? Same shit they've been doing since the dawn of mankind, fighting over "holy land". Only thing different now is that they have modern firepower, politics, and the muslims are more inbred than ever. Jews are greedy and treacherous as usual, but maybe we have something to learn from them, they seem to be doing fine."The middle east has had the unfortunate curse of religion just like all peoples. jews are not greedy nor treacherous they just want to make a living like everyone else."As for Asia, China has a promising future, but Japan is knee-deep in debt. India is overpopulated and North Korea is still a dictatorship. It's certainly going to be an interesting future in those parts."I agree, if japan can get its young adult population out of depression and raise the population a little they would do fine.¬†"USA? I could care less. A bunch of capitalists with huge debt, media-fed sheep and some of the most rotten cancer of the Frankfurt school running wild. They had their chance, maybe, but any hope for their utopia is long gone. All in all, the world is in some ways better, but some ways much shittier than before."Finally something we can come to terms on. If they had not held back blacks and other minorities for 150 years, that would have erased half of the issues we have today."And wait, I'm a white supremacist? No, I would not go out of my way to stomp you, as long as you stay away from my countries, since you're a burden. I wish Africa was as developed as Europe so you could quit your retarded debt and envy-complex and move on with your lives without leeching off us. There is no need to be hostile here, these are just opinions we're exchanging."Oh so you're just a neo segregationist. I'm sorry but i have to say fuck that as well. I like the different options of friends, women, and food and just culture all together and not all of us are rich enough to buy a plane ticket to go across the world. Multi culturalism isnt the issue it's the people who have an issue with multi culturalism that are the issue. The same who can't except others.

Your ancestors dehumanized them and that's that. its not a down to europeans and its not a down to blacks its just history and that's what it should remain. Remember the \textbf{old} saying "Give a man a fish , feed him for a day.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small You know, another possibility for these numbers could simply be that people of Mexican and \textbf{African} decent in America are more likely to be trouble makers who don't care about school, and therefor lead to people assuming that any person of Mexican or \textbf{African} decent are as such. I mean the way people behave comes mostly from the circumstances in which they're raised and the way they're raised by their parents. So if a large portion of Mexican families in America for example came from Mexico poor and living in the "ghetto", then their children are likely to act like the people who are poor and live in the "ghetto" to. And most people of \textbf{African} decent in America came from people who were brought from Africa as being slaves with no rights, and then had to deal with poverty and \textbf{racism} even when they weren't slaves anymore. They probably had to live in the "ghetto", and as such made their children more likely to act "ghetto" to.Another factor could be that the people of \textbf{African} or Mexican decent in America are still kind of living in the poor conditions their parents lived in.

People got up in arms about it because there was a clear perpetrator of the "\textbf{racism}" and we were able to punish him because of it. And once the "\textbf{racism}" was defeated, we felt good because we had "won" and \textbf{racism} had "lost" even though, in the big picture, this was a minor incident and \textbf{nothing} had truly been gained from it.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Yes. As we know \textbf{race} is just skin color.

In the land of the free and home of the out-spoken, bad things are prone to happen. Humanity as a hole is not perfect and needs time to learn things. You could have a solution to destroy \textbf{racism} by forcefully regulating society via an efficient totalitarian system, but I'm not sure that would be a good idea, not to mention it might not work. And I want to say one more thing. If judges treat blacks different, that's just horrible \textbf{racism}. But if companies choose not to hire \textbf{black} people, it's because they have the right to do so, because being free means precisely being able to make decisions that come not from other people but from within, and if companies have a "hunch" that blacks are not a good thing for them, \textbf{nothing} can stop them from making that decision and \textbf{nothing} should.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Nothing, Race, Racism & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}11/235 & \cellcolor{green!5}4.681 \\  \hline

We were in a secluded classroom with no other people around and were told that we could speak freely and anonymously. I looked around and I knew all the people, but they were all in the same friend group that wasn't as racially diverse. We had a very good conversation about how we think the other races were being treated. We came to a conclusion that we realized a few things. Most of us took the same "advance" (I call it that because my school really didn't have any named advance courses, but just separate classes with kids more apt to understanding things better) classes together, and also there were people in our grade calling out "\textbf{RACIST}" when someone even mentioned the color \textbf{black} or white, or even mentioned that someone was \textbf{black}, white, hispanic, asian, or any mix of.I thought this was a very important thing for the school to do, so the school can learn.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small  [LINK] To summarize this article, the patterns of "\textbf{black}" names such as Laquisha and Jamal are not exactly \textbf{black} names, but "poor \textbf{black}" names. Middle and upper class names of blacks are more akin to white names. If we are willing to acknowledge that \textbf{race} has mere correlation to crime whereas economic class has to to do with the causation of crime, for reasons realistically conceivable (e.g. association with theft or drug dealing as a means to access money), then one can argue that employers are justified in less callbacks for Jamal and Laquisha. If comparing equal resumes, an employer would be realistic in being more eager to hire a middle class worker than a lower class worker, simply because less possibility of association with crime.¬†Now, am I saying that it is impossible that an employer ignored the resume because the names are \textbf{black} and not because they are poor? No. It is in fact likely. But because it is nonetheless a slightly wiser choice to an employer's own self interest to call back a middle class person rather than a poor person, the \textbf{race} card can't be pulled from that statistic alone.This is the problem of sociology.

It means that blacks are disproportionately poor compared to white people, but not necessarily that whites today discriminate and continue to hold blacks back.Simply put, there are two possible reasons for the problems you describe:1) Due to historic \textbf{racism}, blacks are more impoverished today than whites, and because poor law enforcement practice they are victims of higher arrests and injustices. This problem is continued by bad economic policy by inner-city politicians (Detroit) which has cause stagnation and dependency for much of the \textbf{black} community.2) The White Population of America (excluding yourself, of course) is \textbf{racist} and refuses to let the \textbf{Black} Community rise up.Option one, I find, is much more reasonable.Instead of screaming \textbf{Racism}, and demanding a population, which almost universally abhors \textbf{racism}, become diversity loving, you should provide real solutions.

How can there be no \textbf{race} when even different ethnicities like Japanese, Korean and Chinese all can be distinguished from each other (if you know what to look for) just by looking at them. If there is that much genetic variation just among Asians, there definitely is much more between different races. Ever seen an \textbf{African}, with no recent white ancestors, with natural \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} hair? If humans have 99.997 genes in \textbf{common} that still leaves a little less than .003 (less because we are obviously not all identical twins). We share about 98 of our DNA with chimps. That's only about 2 difference for a whole other species so that .003 isn't all that insignificant. That and who the hell cares if \textbf{race} exists genetically.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Shannon Fickling That's absolutely correct. \textbf{Race} is a social construct. The human genome project showed that we are a migratory species which originated in Africa. Must take exception to your use of Japanese, Koreans and Chinese being visually discernible. Having traveled extensively in Asia I can attest to very little genetic diversity between the three groups. They are considered a single genetic loci. There are cultural and language differences also national animosity from fairly recent historical events. These in no way make them different in reality.The problem of \textbf{race} exists, there is no denying it. The problem is one of mass psychology and indoctrination. Mass human behavior is driven more by passion and fears than it is by knowledge and reason. Individuals on the other hand have the ability to recognize and correct the flaws in their thinking.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Well I'm sorry you don't agree to the asians looking different thing. They are subtle differences, but if you know what to look for you can tell them apart with pretty good accuracy. That was just an example, there is even more variation with Europeans because it's not just bone structure but also hair and eye color too. Maybe you are defining "\textbf{race}" different, but to me, being able to look at someone and tell their recent ancestry is \textbf{race}. Heck, you may even be able to tell someone's \textbf{ethnicity}, or close to it. I'm only 50 danish and the rest is british or irish, but I've met some scandanavian people who could guess from the shape of my nose that I was Danish. Certainly no one would look at me and think I was \textbf{black} or asian (I could maybe pass for a mix). You can look at Africans and tell what country they are originally from sometimes too. As the world globalizes people will have more "mixed" genetics and it will be harder to tell where someone is from just by looks (it already is sort of like that) but nonetheless there are clues when someone is just a few ethnicities.And these differences are in genetics, so I just don't get how you can say there is no \textbf{race} genetically. If you look at the genes of a bunch of northern europeans, there will be a gene for a more narrow nose than say, the genes of a bunch of people from Africa.

Researchers criticized its analysis for including sentences of probation, which they argued amplified the demographic differences.""In the new study, the Sentencing Commission conducted a separate analysis that excluded sentences of probation.

Sentences of \textbf{black} males were 14.5 longer than whites, rather than nearly 20.Jeff Ulmer, a sociology professor at Pennsylvania State University, described the commission's latest report as an improvement but said it was "a long way from proving that [judicial discretion] has caused greater \textbf{black}-white federal sentencing disparity."I agree there is racial disparity but this is a citation from an article hallmarking conflicting reports and not third party evidence.¬† We need data, not articles about data from several sources that all disagree.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I'd like to just say, that one of the reasons that \textbf{black} people are convicted of drug possesion more is because of the neighbourhoods. Now, I'm discrediting that it's \textbf{racism}. It almost 100 is, I'm pointing out the fact that \textbf{black} neighbourhoods are a much easier target for cops than a white neighbourhood. A lot of cops themselves are not \textbf{racist}, they just want to do a "good job" so they get paid more. Sadly, the differentiation between neighbourhood between races makes \textbf{black} neighbourhoods a very open target. A lot of factors contribute to this partially \textbf{black} people being disadvantaged because of; where they're born, where they can get jobs,etc. Now here comes the part that people might call me \textbf{racist} for. There are a lot of \textbf{black} people who do portray the \textbf{black} stereotype that cops see. These are the people that enforce the stereotype that causes cops to penalise minorities. If a cop goes through a white neighbourhood and see's no one acting suspicious they don't do anything, they just keep going. When they go to a \textbf{black} neighbour hood and see a bunch of kids acting all shifty in an alley, the cop is going to do something about it. Those people are the people who are making the situation worse, if they stop fucking around with drugs and other shit, then their entire \textbf{race} will stop getting stereotyped. I don't what it is. These kids are letting their entire \textbf{race} down, because these slightly \textbf{racist} cops and their very \textbf{racist} chiefs, see all these kids fucking doing stupid shit in the streets. I know you're going to hate me for this, but you don't see that in white neighbourhoods. I don't know why they do this...is it because white kids are mocked for trying to act cool because it's a "\textbf{black} thing". I don't know. Look, the point is. Don't fuck around with the law, don't break the law, don't do stupid shit. Because if you do that shit in front of a \textbf{racist} cop, he will assume every one of you does that.

If human beings are really a "blank slate" why would blacks revert to tribal behavior (gangs, music that emphasizes rhythm and voice, physical assertion of manliness, etc.) after slavery without ever being exposed to it? \textbf{Black} in-group bias and \textbf{black} identity being tied to criminal behavior are just as much of a problem as white genetic history of strict adherence to judaeo-christian traditions that has given us a deep sense of guilt for slavery that and also a sense that we always know what's right. Put in this perspective, the demand for tribal justice demanded by blacks and the endless apologizing of whites makes a lot more sense.I like Richard Dawkin's sentiment, that we are all Africans, one tribe of humanity. I also think memes are more influential than genes and we can change things through education. But the first step is accepting the uncomfortable truth that our genes effect our behavior.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}African, Black, Racism & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}4/184 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.174 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Most, if not all, of these statics are more complex then any one number can really say.¬†Prison sentences difference for the same crime is not really a reasonable way to measure \textbf{racism} in the criminal justice system as the crime is only one factor of a¬†prison sentences. Criminal history is massive. If you get a DUI with no early DUI you spend a night in jail, but if it is the third you are looking at 2 years... that over 700 times the¬†prison sentences¬†for the same crime!!! But no it is not. If any person has a criminal history, they will get a longer jail sentence regardless of \textbf{race}. Then income/wealth plays a huge part in our¬†criminal justice system and white people have more of it then \textbf{black} people. I think OJ proved green is the MOST important color¬†in our criminal justice system. I would guess a large difference in jail time for criminal with a lawyer then those without one for the same crime.

It seems like a line is being drawn in the sand that's pitting groups of Americans against each other..

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The thing about this entire law enforcement vs. \textbf{race} is that people will see a cop shoot a \textbf{black} man and immediately call \textbf{racism}. I know all of us teenagers tend to lean to liberalist thinking, being that teenagers are sort of in the state of liberating themselves from their parents, but honestly, I am not being \textbf{racist}, it's just a fact that more \textbf{black} crimes are committed than any other \textbf{race} in America, even more then white people, who make up the vast majority of America. (But I'm guessing that will change due to the "executive actions" Obama used pertaining to immigration.) There are a million statistics that I could pull up about this, but I'm not a cop, and their racial profiling based on those statistics are their own business. The thing is, if you're Michael Brown, or anyone for that matter, I don't care who you are, you attack a cop, you die. Sorry. Not even taking into account that he was just getting done robbing a store for cigarillos to stuff his weed in. Don't you try to say that he was harmless, because he attacked the cop in his car, and attempted to remove his gun. If you're anybody and you do that to a cop, you die. Sorry. So racial profiling or not, seriously don't mess with cops and everyone will be 100 more alive. Oh and one more thing, I never understood why these people were rioting in Ferguson and destroying their own home... It really makes no sense.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Interesting fact: men are far more likely to receive longer prison sentences than women, for the same crime. While there is a racial angle as well, the ranks goes like this: white women get the shortest sentences, then \textbf{black} women, then white men, and finally, \textbf{black} men get the longest. Sadly, your 20 longer statistic pales in comparison to the 60+ longer sentences men receive in comparison to women.In Canada, infanticide is a crime which can only be committed by women. If a man kills his own child, under the same circumstances, it's murder in the second degree. I believe in Britain, they are lobbying to close women's prison altogether. Apparently it's not good for women to serve prison time, so the study says, but it's a huge boon for men. You should try it!Back to \textbf{racism} though, \textbf{black} families with the same education level, show almost no difference in pay scale, similar to men and women, when you correct for all the factors. Yankees have a plethora of racial issues, probably the worst in the first world, but a biased interpretation of the data does make it any better or worse.I love the resume study too. While it is perfectly legitimate, the number of call backs in no way correlates with the number of job offers. In fact, if you follow that study up, you find the the number of job offers Jamal and Joe receive, despite totally skewed call back rates, are almost identical, just that Jamal didn't waste his time going to 20 extra interviews, to achieve the same goal.Getting a call back from a \textbf{racist} employer, is about as valuable as the lack of a call back, from a \textbf{racist} employer. If someone isn't going to hire based on your name, they sure the hell aren't going to change their mind when they meet you. Just some food for thought. \textbf{Racism} isn't going to be reduced by bringing it up and driving a wedge between the races.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small America \textbf{racist}? I think the world has known this for a long time. \textbf{Racism} in America is more systematic which makes it the worst in the world.I think this stems from American history and slavery. Britain has slaves too but racially it is more advanced than America. I think the difference between American slavery and British slavery is that in American history normal people owned slaves, but in England only the very rich owned slaves so very few British had slavery in their past. In Britain it was more about class so a slave was considered equal to a white peasant and \textbf{black} person was considered equal to a white person of the same class and that is why slavery ended in Britain almost a hundred years earlier. The British also didn't try to kill educated \textbf{black} people like America.The fact average white people had slaves in America has created this superiority complex in white Americans towards \textbf{black} people that isn't as strong in Britain. That superiority complex is why \textbf{black} people are discriminated against and disadvantaged in America and why there is great cultural segregation in America compared to the UK.That white people are better and shouldn't mix with \textbf{black} people doesn't exist in Britain, you can't say that about all of America. This is why Britain has the highest percentage rate of interracial couples in the world and as well as the highest percentage of biracial people in the western world were 50 of the \textbf{ethnic} population has a parents of two different races. I would argue \textbf{African} Americans have higher respect in Britain than American white people. British do white better than America but they don't have a Martin Luther, Muhammad Ali, Tiger Woods, Michael Jordan, Will Smith and even anti-heroes like Michael Jackson and Tyson are massively popular in Britain. You throw up a great American white guy and the Brit have 10 guys better because it is the place of Shakespeare, Newton, the Rolling Stones, the Beatles and moulded the modern world.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}African, Black, Ethnic, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}9/340 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.647 \\  \hline

I tend to notice that everyone's attempts at coming closer to equality only serve to segregate us all further apart. Unfortunately, I'm not here to present any kind of solution. Something like this is too complex to offer up a solution on a youtube comment. But I will say this: very rarely do I come across someone who claims to be fighting for equality without hate in their hearts for the other party. And no matter what their excuse, it's still the same hate that started the problems in the first place.

You are suggesting that the color of someone's skin determines whether or not someone is defensive when faced with this subject.¬†People of all races get defensive in conversations of \textbf{racism}. White people get defensive when others call their entire \textbf{race} out on being \textbf{racist}. The Japanese get defensive when discussing their stereotypical Gonguro Girls. Some Zimbabweans get defensive when discussing their racially-charged land reforms.I know you were specifically referring to conversations of \textbf{race} on the internet from a primarily Western-centric view, though, but it is untrue even in this perspective. Just going on r/TumblrInAction disproves the idea that only whites can be defensive in these situations.So stop singling out entire races when talking about \textbf{racism}, even when you are trying to do it innocently.

Every \textbf{ethnic}, racial, and religious group has, at some point, suffered widespread slavery. The Chinese, Irish, even Jews suffered persecution and general socioeconomic discrimination, Irish were shipped to America as slaves too even but you don't see them complaining. Unlike Africans, they didn't cling to this past like a crutch, waving it in the air as an example to all of why not only they're entitled to society's resources but also as an excuse for their embarrassing behavior as a \textbf{race}. Less than 10 of southern families owned slaves, a minority of slaves were sent to America even, the majority being sent to Mexico where today they've been bred almost entirely into local populations; at least here in America you have an identity. There were even fucking Blacks who owned other \textbf{Black} slaves, but you act as though Africans have, "FOR CENTURIES", been the world's exclusive slaves. Your excuses are so obviously self-serving, try to be less transparent. That's not even to mention that the majority of \textbf{African} Americans today weren't descended from slaves, nor the FACT that \textbf{African} Americans enjoy a far, FAR greater standard of life here in America versus their home continent. Go hang out in Nigeria for awhile and then come back and complain about the results of slavery please. Slavery was practiced in Africa for thousands of years before Whites showed up, and it's still a widespread problem there today, AMONG \textbf{African} Americans. What's the deal, you idiots didn't learn? Even slaves sent to America were originally captured by other Africans, taken to trading ports to be sold to White merchants, often acting through an \textbf{African} middle-man. Your own people are just as responsible for your misfortunes as Whites. Those former slaves that did return to Africa when \textbf{Abe} Lincoln purchased Liberia to initiate the 'Back to Africa' campaign soon got a taste of the violence of their own \textbf{race} when the country was overthrown by locals, and the ruling family, former \textbf{African} Americans, were brutally raped and murdered, only one member barely escaping to flee back to the arms of the US. Haiti used to be known as the Jewel of Caribbean until Africans overthrew French settlers, burning the plantations and leaving themselves in a state of poverty that persists today; ironically only kept from total chaos by the helping hand of yours truly, those of European blood.Leave it to an \textbf{African} American to blame the criminal culture of their own \textbf{race} on socioeconomic disparity and slavery though, despite getting preferential treatment for scholarships, college applications, and jobs. Going to cry and claim you don't? Organizations over a certain size are REQUIRED by LAW to hire a certain amount of minorities. Further, colleges can and often do select \textbf{African} Americans and other minorities preferentially over Whites because of similar government policies. Kids are barraged with \textbf{Black} History month every year until they leave college. Congratulations, you're a very vocal minority who has managed to complain enough we now cater to your needs. But that's not going to last forever. In a few years, Whites will be a minority compared to Hispanics, if they already aren't due to illegal immigration, and we'll see if the average Pablo is interested in being the moral heirs of our modern, liberal masters who shower the \textbf{African} \textbf{race} with apologetic social programs for the imagined slight of slavery.I believe people should have the resources they need to survive as well, that we should have equity and most importantly understanding among races. Fools like you though snub progress, you're rooted firmly in the past, blaming the problems of your \textbf{race} on everyone but yourselves. You're a 3rd world people trying to adjust to a 1st world civilization and mindset; European civilization was built by the European mind, for the European. Our people developed to anticipate long winters, those that weren't smart died. Hardship caused us to develop architecture, government, food preservation techniques, clothes, and indirectly culture flourished as a result. Consider Africans though, supposedly the most ancient section of humanity but, to quote Darwin, content to graze for an hour. No long winters to prepare for. Few structures more advanced than huts of mud and sticks. Plentiful game. All you really had to do, for millennia, is chase animals with sticks. Explains why Africans do so well in track, eh? But I guess you'll deny the correlation. In essence, Africans don't have the sense of foresight that Europeans do; to deny this, and the numerous other differences between us only exacerbates societal conflicts. We're trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. In the end, we're all pegs. You're a human being, yes, as much as you'd prefer to believe I don't think so. But we're different human beings, and while there are exceptions to every standard, ignoring our general traits and qualities will only, and has only lead to widespread difficulties.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Abe, African, Black, Ethnic, Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Religious Identity - Jewish & \cellcolor{green!5}17/921 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.846 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small You are factually incorrect. I don't know where you're getting your statistics, but mine come from the CDC and US Census, they're easily verifiable. Whites are more likely to kill themselves than be victim to or commit a gun crime, as opposed to \textbf{African} Americans who are killing each other in record rates; you didn't misunderstand me, you misunderstood the statistics you think are supporting your argument, when they certainly aren't. Hispanics are included with Whites, but if you subtracted their numbers you'd see a much larger decline in the gun violence rates than 1/4th and for obvious reasons. If anyone has the right to complain about the effects of poverty and systematic abuse from the government, it's them.Africans had thousands of years before the rise of European civilization to rise themselves and flourish, do you forget Africa is humanity's birthplace? For the reasons I mentioned in my last comment, Africans never had the need to develop more than a small, nomadic civilizations. The few exceptions are directly because of Arabic, \textbf{Indian}, and European influence and trade, bringing culture, architecture, and organized religion into the region long before the comparatively brief period slavery and colonialism that followed, not that, again, every \textbf{ethnicity} hasn't suffered the same treatment. The Chinese suffered some of the worst effects of colonialism, you don't see them perpetuating a criminal culture and blaming the British for all their economic and social problems. Africans had many, many opportunities to start over, I mentioned two of them in fact, Liberia and Haiti; no one forced Africans to burn down the orchards after they raped and murdered their White Masters. No one forced the \textbf{African} Chieftains to pillage and enslave their fellow Africans and sell them to Whites, as they had been doing for hundreds, perhaps thousands of years. No one forced \textbf{African} Liberians to hold themselves above native Africans, persecuting them in a way that's been repeated throughout history and causing the revolution that resulted in Liberia's fall. These are just a few examples, I could literally offer hundreds. All you can do is make sweeping claims, generalizations that have no basis in fact.There were stores in America that said, 'NO IRISH', many of them were brought over here as slaves. The very word slave is European, based on Slavic people who were enslaved by Romans. Many Chinese who helped build America weren't even paid, they were given meals and board. Japanese Americans who had their businesses, homes, and lives confiscated by America during WWII didn't suddenly turn to crime, they haven't been complaining for 70 years like \textbf{African} Americans have, many of whom aren't even descended from slaves themselves, even more ironically complaining to Whites who were unlikely even closely related to slave owners.Oh, there are more white millionaires and they pass the money down to their descendents? Gee, I wonder if that has anything to do with culture. How many \textbf{black} athletes and "musicians" appear to have a strong focus in creating a better life for their children? I suppose blowing all their wealth in such shocking rates that athletes are now required to go through financial-management classes before isn't very indicative of that though hmm? Again, hundreds of examples where they not only neglect their children, but focus entirely on themselves, gluttons to the end. This is the ramification of introducing a 3rd world people to a 1st world \textbf{nation}, and comes back to the sense of foresight \textbf{African} Americans never needed to develop in the praeries of Africa, versus Europeans anticipating long winters, preparing architecture to keep warm, food preservation techniques, etc. Difficult to deny isn't it? If Africans had a culture based around hard work sprinkled with a bit of nepotism like we have in European culture, we'd see something different. But is that what you Africans really want to do, inherit our cultural values; you can't find your own?To answer your silly question, \textbf{racism} never stopped. There was discrimination against blacks, which I agree was a problem, I wholeheartedly believe in certain equities between races, and then \textbf{racism} continued in the form of affirmative action gone-wild, where schools and corporations are forced to choose less qualified \textbf{African}-American candidates simply because the law requires them to. This sense of obligation pours into our culture and we do to \textbf{African} Americans much the same we do to their Native Africa. Why do they need to grow crops, invest in infrastructure if we're going to send them raw food every year? Why do they need to improve as a society if they look to us to do it for them, but on the other hand blame us for their problems, for not doing enough? Eventually the European system will collapse, and we'll see if Jamal and Pedro are interested in being the moral heirs of our founding fathers.

Then continue on to list every generic response I have ever heard from white people to justify \textbf{racist} thinking.Bringing up Liberia doesn't negate the \textbf{racism} of Americans. Neither does \textbf{African} participation in the slave trade. That's flawed logic. People that study \textbf{African} history and the slave trade know that Africa was a complex region of warring powers, the same as Europe during that same time in history. Africans did not see themselves as one people, no more than Europeans did (or do).Your choice to homogenize a whole \textbf{race} in some flimsy narrative of "well your people did it too" shows just how \textbf{racist} your thinking is. Yes, slavery existed everywhere. But that's shitty logic to use to absolve the industry that Europeans made of \textbf{black} slaves. That's like dismissing genocide by saying "well other people committed genocide too."Come on, man.There is no evidence of anything as massive as the Mid-Atlantic Slave Trade. We're talking millions of people. And you are over here asking me if I know about \textbf{African} participation?¬† As if Africans convinced Europeans to rape and plunder an entire continent? As if they really had a choice when Europeans with massive armies came knocking at their door in search of slaves?I recognize that their were politics in Africa that played a part in the Atlantic Slave Trade. But the actions of powerful \textbf{African} kings doesn't absolve what happened to those millions of people. And it doesn't clean the hands of Europeans who benefited from that terror. It doesn't wash away the \textbf{black} people that were tortured and murdered under slavery.Modern Africans that know of their part in the slave trade have made their apologies. They are not innocent. But neither are Europeans. And lets be real. What \textbf{black} people are decrying is a long history of oppression in the \textbf{nation} they now call their own that continues TODAY. That is not the fault of Africans. Your logic is so flimsy that it hurts my eyes to see it.I won't even touch the effects of colonialism, since you seem to think that instability in formerly colonized places happened in some magic vacuum devoid of contexts.I won't even explain the flaws in your belief that wars in \textbf{African} countries somehow justify your \textbf{racism}, as if Europeans didn't engage in two World Wars.And your ideology about revolutions is similarly problematic considering the bloody history of European revolutions.People ARE people. Your \textbf{racism} is a product of your \textbf{racist} culture.

If you can't step up to the table with adults, you should go back to your soapbox where the conversation is more one way because you seem pretty incapable of responding with anything but outrage and a petty statement of disagreement, backed with \textbf{nothing} except the all-qualifying validation that you're \textbf{African}. I wasn't aware every \textbf{African} was born educated toward their history, at home and abroad, but apparently you think so because it's 'utterly unbelievable' to you that anyone but a \textbf{black} person could know anything about 'blackness', as if that statement in itself doesn't speak toward your ignorance.Do you even know what bigotry is? I've found a lot of \textbf{African} Americans don't, despite the word being one of their favorites. Bigotry is¬† intolerance towards those who hold different opinions from oneself. If you find my ideas so 'utterly unbelivable', then maybe you should take a hard look in the mirror and ask yourself who the real bigot is, and how that's clouded your insight. I empathize with your position though, your whole life you were barraged with these sweeping generalizations and now you just bleat them out like you're on autopilot.Bringing up Liberia doesn't negate the \textbf{racism} of Americans? Interesting how you fixate on that one example when I offered several and encouraged you to research the hundreds of others; but I'll entertain your train of thought, no matter how deluded. Of course Africa was/is a complex region, thank you Cpt. Obvious, but the point is slaves, in the MILLIONS, have been taken en mass from all races up to modern day, but only one uses this is their go-to excuse for poor performance; probably because you have so little to be genuinely proud of. Do yourself a favor and research slavery in Eastern Europe; numbers easily reach over the millions, yet you think, like Israel denying the equality of any holocaust aside from their own, that Africans are the great bearers of the burdern of slavery. Even further, that White Americans are the perpetrators; despite slavery being widespread in Africa long, long before we arrived, despite the fact slavery persists among Africans today, and all over the world. Stretching even more, you think all White Americans owe your whole \textbf{race} a societal debt, despite less than 10 of southern White families owning slaves and millions of Whites and Blacks who immigrated post slavery.Come on man.Again, I'll educate you in your own people's history and inform you that \textbf{African} warlords were doing far more raping and pillaging than any European ever did on the continent, and I'd argue I think accurately that today warlords continue to rape and pillage the continent, the only difference being their empowerment with European technology. Guess you'll blame us for that one too. Damn Europeans and their technology! Hilarious. \textbf{African} warlords pillaged, gathered the slaves, and brought them to slave markets where they were sold. A few hundred years before they were being shipped east, into Arabian and Asian countries. Do you realize that the entire American slave trade was run by less than a handful of corporations, and that the owners of these corporations were mostly foreigners? At least you acknowledge that "their were politics in Africa that played a part in the Atlantic Slave Trade", though I wonder why I'm debating with someone who doesn't know the difference between 'their' and 'there' but acts at the same time like I'm the uneducated one. There's so many holes in your logic I could do this all day. Do you think I haven't heard these excuses before? You're practically boring me, try coming up with something new.'You won't touch on this', 'you won't explain the flaws' in that, yeah, because you're incapable. Having some cognitive dissonance about now? I'll bet. You can assume I homogenize a whole \textbf{race} in a few 'flimsy narratives', but by and large populations do follow certain cultural tendencies, you'd be stupid to deny that. Of course, there are always exceptions, and I see you prefer to think of yourself and your friends as examples of that; but you and I both know that I'm right, despite the few miracle babies you think are European enough to qualify as civilized. I've had this same conversation with \textbf{African} Americans face-to-face, ones who are capable of acknowledging the flaws of their own \textbf{race}, as I am of my own.

I could play that game with you too, but I don't believe in that ideology (I'm a socio-linguist). I know the difference between there and their, but go ahead, use that to insult my intelligence.Listen dude. I get it. You are a bigot. (Bigotry actually has a few definitions in the dictionary. You are familiar with multiple meanings, right?) You took a lot of stuff from history and twisted it into a narrative that bolsters your prejudice. That isn't a new trick. Anyone can do that. History is long and full of accounts. That is why historians will disagree with each other. But somehow you think listing the sins of \textbf{African} "warlords" is supposed to make me believe that my people are only good because Europeans civilized them.I believe power is curruptable. But this isn't unique to Africans. Neither is raping and pillaging. Neither is slavery. You seemed to miss my point entirely. Listing other examples of slavery does not absolve the Western slave system built on \textbf{black} bodies, nor does it absolve the over a century of oppression that followed suit, nor does it absolve the systemic discrimination still present today. Yes, other people do bad things. Using it as an argument to defend your own \textbf{racist} thinking is ridiculous. Humans everywhere have done the things you described. Europe was engaged in warfare for centuries. War stems from instability and fighting over resources. It also comes from power struggles and opposing ideals. SOME \textbf{African} countries are experiencing that right now, just like Europeans had their dark \textbf{age}. A lot of the instability is due to the effects of colonialism and the vacuum created after Europeans left the continent. However, there are \textbf{African} countries that are doing quite well and having some of the fastest growing economies.You call me boring as if you are spouting new ideas. You are not. If you think my ideas are \textbf{old}, yours are older. And worse, they are morally bankrupt.My big point is, despite other people doing bad things, Western white supremacist culture needs to take responsibility for its discrimination against minorities. Citing examples of \textbf{African} wrong-doing does not absolve white supremacist thinking or action because I am not arguing that Africans are free from wrong-doing. What I am pointing to is the systemic oppression of minorities in THIS discussion. Don't assume that I don't have things to say about my own culture. You don't know me. You using this generalized notion of "talking to other \textbf{black} people" doesn't apply to me. I am myself. I have my own scathing indictments of AA culture. I don't need yours compounded with the idea that we are inferior. All cultures have flaws. That is not the measure of human worth.I am not a miracle baby. I am a human being. I happen to be \textbf{black} and that is a part of my existence on this planet. It carries a history of oppression and glaring examples of discrimination against people that look like me in the present. It means I have to talk to people like you, that would use the same ideology Europeans used when they enslaved millions of \textbf{black} people, that we are somehow inferior., as a means of justifying your prejudice. It means I have to listen to you recite history to me, praising your European technology and civilization. But it doesn't mean I have to think of myself as less. And it doesn't mean I have to buy into your \textbf{racism}.Yes, your culture won. You took over the world. You colonized it. You made slaves and servants of all its \textbf{colored} people. Yes, your culture did that. But it doesn't make you better. These are not things to be proud of.Your culture got to write the history books because you robbed the whole world of its development. Technology isn't the measure of a civilization no more than achievement is the measure of a human being. And if you think Europeans got where they are from their own ingenuity alone you are wrong. It was on the backs of the rest of the world. There were great civilizations, schools and thinkers in Africa, the Middle-East and Asia, long before Europeans decided they should conquer the world (you like reading so read the scores of books written by historians about people that didn't look like you). Math and science and poetry existed in those civilizations as well, before Europeans conquered them.¬† Even after that, the conquered people killed themselves filling European pockets and stomachs, giving the great minds the leisure to contemplate the great mysteries of the universe. Not needing to go into a field and grow food for your slave masters gave the Western World a lot of time to write their version of history where they are the only ones that matter. You can white-wash history but it doesn't mean I have to buy into your \textbf{racism}.Look, I see where your head is at. I understand what you believe about human life and especially the lives of \textbf{black} people. I realize your mind won't change simply because I call you \textbf{racist}. That's never worked for people like you. You believe vehemently in your version of reality.I believe in a different version. I see the world differently than you do. I have to. I am not of European descent. I come from one of the conquered nations. A lot of my history has been erased.

White skinned people are more likely to be hired than a brown skinned person, in spite of Affirmative Action. The most appalling fact of all is the egregious way in which cops treat \textbf{black} men. A \textbf{black} man is more likely to be killed by cops than a white man.The best example I can give is on August 6, 2014 a 46 year \textbf{old} San Diego man was walking around the De Anza Cove Park area of Mission Bay, which was populated with children, waving a gun. The police negotiated with the man for over 30 minutes even though the man poited the gun at civilians and police! They eventually wounded him with a single gun shot. He lived.Yet twelve year \textbf{old} Tamir Rice, who was playing with a toy gun, wasn't even given two seconds. The cop shot the child dead.In the past year the instances of overreaction by police has increased at an alarming rate.It's important to understand that acknowledging this takes \textbf{nothing} away from other people who also suffer. Acknowledging that \textbf{black} men are more likely to be killed by cops does not ignore or negate the white men who fall victim to police brutality.Acknowledging that \textbf{black} men are discriminated against in almost every aspect of life does not deny the \textbf{homophobia} experienced by \textbf{L\textbf{G\textbf{BT}}} folks.This isn't a contest.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}African, Black, Ethnic, Homophobia, LGBT, Nothing, Old, Racism & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s, Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Sexual Identity - General, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality, Sexual Identity - Transexuality & \cellcolor{green!27}14/299 & \cellcolor{green!27}4.682 \\  \hline

Unfortunately I'm sure the internet will fail to have the maturity to deal with this video appropriately, but in some cases conversations that need to be had, will be had, so I sincerely thank you for that. I know at least within the NerdFighter community this will resonate appropriately. The rest of the world still unfortunately sucks a bit too much to be optimistic in the hope that people can weigh overwhelming data against what they "think", and deal with it rationally. Faith and Feeling are Not Reason nor the means finding one's way to reason. With that in mind I want to bring up something that has been happening in the comments.The idea of Classicism vs \textbf{Racism} as the culprit. I think that people for the most part would rather believe that classicism is more or most at fault because they idea of having to admit there is a problem regarding \textbf{racism} in this country makes them "feel bad" or that one someone says it their "unpatriotic". Which is frankly just \textbf{blind} "\textbf{nationalism}", and dangerous.Is it not entirely possible that there is both \textbf{Racism} and Classicism in America, and that they are both a problem, one that ultimately disproportionately effects \textbf{Black} people of all heritages and cultures (not just \textbf{African} Americans), as well as Hispanics, Immigrants and the general poor (more or less in that order)?¬†Does it really have to be one or the other?

To write them off as "affecting someone else." Poverty is a problem no matter who suffers it. Police brutality is a problem no matter who endures it. While the hashtag "\textbf{black} lives matter" may be a nice rallying cry... it's also perpetuating the problem by codifying the difference. Lives matter.

Secondly, the issue being addressed here is who has rights to the land and you are, still, wrong in your claim. Those who originally settled, all the natives, should stay. Those who created it, built it, and made it what it is today (not to mention these people were typically on good terms/favored by the natives) should stay. But those who have been stealing it piece by piece? They have the least amount of rights to the land they stole. They're called invaders or "conquerors" for a reason. They were not invited, entrusted, or bequeathed the land. They have stolen it and built upon it and have taken credit for others' labor.

Not because \textbf{racism} against white people doesn't exist, but because that attempt at paralleling the two situations is ridiculous. It's like someone saying "I know he lost 20 dollars, but I lost 5 dollars! Help me find my 5 dollars!" Ok fine, but your 5 dollars isn't what we're talking about right now. It's not less important, or even all that different, but trying to change the focus like that has \textbf{nothing} to do with the conversation we're having HERE.I think it's also important to point out that there is a huge difference between \textbf{racism} and discrimination. If you're \textbf{racist}, fine. Stay away from me and everyone else. That's your messed up problem. When discussing systemic \textbf{racism}, we're talking about discrimination. We're talking about profiling. We're talking about building institutions on \textbf{racism} and putting that \textbf{racism} to use to deny people of color opportunities that white people have. This is where the shouts of "what about us" from certain self-proclaimed white victims come apart. The fact is that the system that has been established has never afforded people of color, \textbf{African} Americans specifically, to even begin to shut white people out of these institutions. Those who cite Affirmative Action as an example of systemic \textbf{racism} against white people seem to forget that it was created as attempt to level the playing field of systemic \textbf{racism} against everyone else.

I guess it's just that, I think that, in general, when humans point out a problem they have, it's not necessarily to boost themselves, but more, I guess, instinctive? As if the story just falls from their mouth because it's such a natural reaction to want to share happy and unhappy moments. We are emotional creatures. So like, when anyone says something about something they went through, I basically figure they have a direct experience they had that they are referencing. I think that's a really universal thing and I don't really blame people for that. You know, as long as they can keep it in perspective. But yeah I just think when people share things it's usually really specific, it's not so much to claim, therefore all whites go through this or all blacks go through this, it's more like I went through something and I want to share it because I share things and we listen and we say oh I hope you don't have to go through that again etc etc. That's why I think we should appreciate things moment by moment. Maybe one second I'll be saying, oh, I hope that \textbf{black} couple I know will get treated justly in the future, and then if a few seconds later a white person told me something they went through I'll want the same for them, I won't think, oh now I can't appreciate \textbf{black} people anymore.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Rob Graff I think the problem here is that we really do need to have a conversation about \textbf{race}... but no one seems to actually be willing to have that 'conversation'. When it comes to social issues, most people would rather monologue about their views than initiate a true discussion.When I try to have a conversation about \textbf{race} with someone who politically leans left, they tend to monologue about how only specific demographics can ever be effected by it, and will consider any dissenting views to be 'racist', 'bigoted', or 'distracting from the real issue'.When I try to have a conversation about \textbf{race} with someone who politically leans right, they tend to monologue about how majorities have racial issues too and will claim that minorities can somehow overcome racial oppression just by catering to their supposed oppressors.Independents and moderates tend to be a mixed bag, as they seem to lean toward either side, or they just flat-out shut down the conversation because it's too uncomfortable (understandably so).I've noticed that none of these people I encounter tend to provide viable solutions to these issues or even bipartisan ideals that could potentially lead to a solution... which is forgivable since this conflict is extremely ambiguous, but also disappointing.Reparations sound sensible at first, but then how do we decide who gets them when nearly every demographic has been systematically stepped on at some point in history? Besides, issues like \textbf{racism}, \textbf{sexism}, and \textbf{classism} aren't exactly quantifiable when it comes to figuring out how much compensation should be provided to those who've experienced them.Increasing legislature sounds sensible at first, but how do we create laws that'll benefit only specific demographics without stirring up more separatism in the general population? Besides, we've been trying to fix this problem through the law for centuries, and that alone hasn't resulted in much progress.Increasing awareness and pushing toward a cultural shift seems like the most promising potential solution, but you can never really control how a culture is going to change, and it could take centuries before we see any notable progress.Ironically enough, as big an issue as \textbf{racism} is... it  really is a problem that'll eventually solve itself. Humans are guaranteed to breed all racial differences out of their species at some point,  but I think we can all agree that we shouldn't try to wait that long for a resolution to these conflicts.I'd say that as individuals, the most we can do nowadays is learn to properly address and quell the subtle separatist systems and the not-so-subtle individual bigots we encounter in our daily lives.

But there's no government or social institution perpetuating this. Is it a coincidence that white people who also grow up in "the hood" are living just as poorly? Of course not. Poverty is decided by where a person is born, not the color of the skin they're born with. Is it any less terrible? No, but accepting every other factor aside from \textbf{race} will help to fight poverty in the long run.The way to fix \textbf{race} relations is not to talk about them and try to level the playing field with Affirmative Action, in fact it's the opposite.

There seems to be an ever growing trend among minorities and leftists to drive home the supposed disparities and "\textbf{racism}" in America. Have any one of you guys stopped to understand why these phenomenon are happening besides "whites are racists"?

As if portraying them infantile and in a bad state and the only people who can save them is essential whites because it was whites who put blacks in this state would improve anything.

Children raised in poorer families are typically not expected to acheive as much as those raised in wealthier families, and the vast majority of those are white, you are much better off being born to a middle class \textbf{black} family than a poor white family.In response to the study conducted by the university of chicago, I would expect that you would see a similar result if you compared more 'working class white names' such as Cheryl or Tyler (no offence if you have those names) to less working class names like Eleanor or James.

Is it already equal systemically but we will just need time to catch up?I'm extremely distrustful of systems. They are creations. None have functioned perfectly for the needs of all.

(We can hardly have an honest national discussion regarding \textbf{racism} while some insist upon conflating very different and important concepts.)It's obvious that everyone is capable of \textbf{racism} (according to the most widely-accepted set of definitions), and it's important to establish our inherent propensities for benevolence and malevolence as being equal. In my opinion, the majority of our white citizens aren't concerned about \textbf{ethnic} elements as they go¬†about their daily lives -- until someone points out that they're being \textbf{racist} for breathing. It's a good way to start a brawl instead of a constructive dialogue...We can (and should) go through the various elements that comprise hiring practices and other things associated with (privilege, oppression, pick an article of contention), but dismissing the responses of a given¬†camp is a reprehensible practice.Even if we (as a culture, or even species) removed all \textbf{ethnic} disparities from the equation, we would merely¬†direct our competitions along other distinctions. We're human, it's what we do.Many of us are beyond weary of the political end-arounds that are convenient when conducting large-scale social experiments.As far as I'm concerned, those days are gone and attempts to revive them will lead to war.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnic, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}5/234 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.137 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@ArachnoscribeI agree with you that dimissal is a really bad approach. I do think, however, that many minorities feel dimissed. The burden of proof is on them to legitimize real systemic injustices. When they are dismissed they dismiss the dismisser, which may not be the best approach, but is understandable considering.It is also understandable when white people feel victimized when minorities say they are part of/perpetuating a \textbf{racist} system. Even if we don't think about what we are doing in regards to (insert political issue) it doesn't change the fact, however, that our actions and behaviors are causing them or maintaining them. Oppression isn't always an active process. It can be passive as long as social ideology allows for it to exist de facto.Many minorities with the ability to argue this fact will assure people that they are critiquing systems and our conscious/unconscious maintenance of those systems. Sometimes passions lead to blaming people.But it is my opinion that we all share responsibility for these things. Even minorities. None of this is happening in a vacuum.Your perspective is reasonable and I thank you for sharing it in such an intelligent way. As far as I can see, I agree with you.But I also agree with others on this that say these things intersect. I think they do. \textbf{Racism} and systemic oppression intersect. They are both cause and effect of each other.I don't think we can move forward and have real change until we can be honest about all the ways our laws and practices do harm. Instead of blaming, maybe we can work on better practices.

In the same way, discrimination may be individual but can also be a part of a larger system of discrimination. \textbf{Jim C\textbf{row}} is representative of this. The prison industrial complex is representative of this. Systems exist. Some positive and some harmful.¬†If we can conceive of governmental systems then social systems are not a stretch. They exist and are observable. A person can look at things within context. This is good.

If it is also to discover our disalignments, then I think that has been accomplished as well. It may not be possible to convince you further than where you stand.Still though, it is important in these discussions to acknowledge subjectivity. Perhaps the conversation shouldn't be who is right. Perhaps it may be better to allow different conceptions of the world to exist simultaneously. It is unlikely that you will convince an entire population of oppressed people that systemic oppression doesn't exist. It might be better to accept that this is a fact of the world and leave the discussion of such issues to those inclined to them.I think it is a mistake that we believe everyone has to unanimously agree on a thing in order for it to be legitimate to some. Some people, because of their beliefs, simply will not, can not, acknowledge some things. We should not require anyone to give that up for the sake of an objective/absolute truth we have yet to prove.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@ArachnoscribeGood morning, friend.Thanks for taking the time to respond back to me.Science is an invention and more than anything it is a set of standards/approaches used to discover "truths" about the world. Social science is useful when it comes to looking at and discovering things about society. How it works. How it maintains itself. And what unsavory/unexpected byproducts come out of societal systems.I think the scientific method is very useful when we look at how societies should function for the benefit of the most people (though that shouldn't be the only consideration). This might be another difference of ours. I don't see activism disguising itself as science. I see it as using the scientific method to point to/discover the failings of systems. If we say A, but results show B, then we have something to think about/look at. If we want equality but when our institutions are tested with the scientific method and shown to not be equal and we can see the reasons why that might be, then it is something worth looking at.The scientific method, though repurposed to be as efficient as possible, has existed since forever. Monkeys do it. You test the world and the most favorable result, you adopt. We conceptualized it to fit our ideals, but it too can be stretched to meet other purposes. Come up with a hypothesis. Test it. See where the results lead. Analyze them. Make conclusions. Scientific disciplines have used this approach to revise its own ideas since its inception. Why should this be different for activism or any other human endeavor with real human impact? And why can this not be "scientific."Of course I am biased, being that I am a member of the social sciences and consider myself an activist. I just don't see those things as needing to be separate. They feed into each other. Just like a physicists passions and ambitions for himself and the world play into his study of physics. Again, we reach another perceptive difference.I will say this too. I agree with creating alternatives. That is my personal mission as well. But while you choose not to measure which camp is less malignant, I choose to be a part of that conversation and move passed conversations of malignancy and towards collective benefit. It is not a war tactic for me, but one for establishing peace.¬† I'm very passionate about it and deeply invested in it, I must admit, since I am \textbf{black} and have experienced many of these systemic inequalities. What I wish is to change conceptions or expand them as much as possible so that all people can live peaceably and according to their needs. Part of that is creating alternatives (something I explore constantly) and the other part is being critical about the culture and society I currently inhabit. These two efforts culminate in activism.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!27}1/481 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.208 \\  \hline

I know we've covered that already, but I wanted to throw something out there...So many \textbf{African} Americans (pick a synonym) seem to be convinced¬†that they are incapable of \textbf{racism}. They often cite variations of¬†the formula \textbf{Racism}=Oppression+Prejudice (which we've also covered) as justification...(Am I correct in believing that the aforementioned is a reference to whites?)I submit that by suggesting¬†non-white people are incapable of generating certain sets of thoughts and/or actions which have helped to define our species* (as stated ad nauseam in countless settings), one possible conclusion is that only¬†white people are fully human.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@ArachnoscribeI am very sorry to hear about your accident. It sounds like it would be extremely difficult to deal with. I've found your arguments quite clear actually, but I appreciate you sharing that with me. Please, come back to the conversation when you are most able.I'd like you to elaborate on the following though:"As someone who studies the reactions of¬†those who aren't activists but are exposed to (what they perceive to be) unusual practices, I have become invested in bridging the gap. Unfortunately, many of our citizens circled their wagons in 2014 -- and their wagons are unlikely to move again. (While it's true they'll just die eventually, that's hardly comforting.) It's an interesting development."I'm not one of those people that believe minorities can't be \textbf{racist}. The situation is way too complicated to make such a statement. Prejudice is not unique to dominant peoples. It is a human quality.However, I do believe that power imbalances do affect the amount of harm that prejudice can inflict. That is a different thing altogether.To elaborate further. I think it is \textbf{racist} to say white people are evil. However, it is not \textbf{racist} to say that white culture dominates. Or that we live in a white supremacist society. Often in media discussions I hear people say that to even bring up racial inequalities is \textbf{racist} or to point to systems of oppression. That to me implies that racism="talking about \textbf{race} relations" when that is not what I believe it means at all. Being color-blind is ingenuous and works to mask the way color still affects our society. A better state of affairs would be to acknowledge difference while acknowledging the basic humanity of other people. We are all humans; we just have different experiences of the world.I like to tell people that they should assume that people are people. This may seem redundant, but for me, it helps alleviate \textbf{racist} thinking if applied properly. If there is a crime in a certain area, it might be good to ask the right questions about environment and social situations. When people in the media say that the problem is \textbf{black} crime, I believe that this comes from a fundamental assumption that \textbf{black} people aren't people. Crime has causes; it isn't the cause itself. To say that assumes that \textbf{black} people just want to commit crime in a way that isn't true of other people. Sociologists have studied and found that crime is usually a result of resource problems (lack of or unequal access to resources). That isn't to say that ideology doesn't affect this, but even ideology is contextualized. Human beings, just like everything else in the universe, respond to stimuli, whether internal or external. We could assume that there is something fundamentally different in \textbf{black} brains, but science has yet to show that, and it begs the question: why would we want to make that assumption? Better to assume people are people and address resource inequalities.I think the same applies to what you are saying. If white people can be \textbf{racist}, all people can be \textbf{racist}.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Race, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}12/520 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.308 \\  \hline

I could be wrong. And you could be right. Or vice versa. I do believe, however, that we may both be a little bit right.¬†It is my humble opinion that society is shifting. It may have always been doing this. It may not be significantly more than in the past. But what we are seeing is educated people taking to the interwebs and speaking into cavernous chambers of society: "we want equality."¬†We are seeing more critical thought about \textbf{race}, \textbf{gender}, orientation, and a million other issues that we never saw in the past. Critical eyes have been focused on the way we treat society's poor and the need for poverty generally. "Progressives" as you might call them want equal treatment of \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} people, minorities, \textbf{q\textbf{ueer}} peoples, people with different religions or creeds. Fairness and the realization that people are people and that by the very act of being present in our society should have certain rights.¬†I love all of this.¬†When people say social justice warriors aren't allowed or I witness the venom of bigoted people on the internet,¬† I see this as either a death rattle (that world is shrinking more and more) or an ideological war playing out among human beings.¬†You already know where I align. But among the ever growing "over-educated" you see a criticality burgeoning, not just toward these ideologies of our past that justified so many atrocities, but towards the ideologies of our present, that are so complex that they require measured and sustained thought. Among these young people, no institution is safe from scrutiny. That includes academia.¬†"Social justice warriors" as you call them are passionate about such causes and can be rabid. This can be alienating. And it no doubt has stifled important conversation that we aren't having. That overzealousness is a human trait. It is problematic and should be challenged. We should do better when it comes to talking about this things.¬†I do believe that this is the lesser of two evils. An evil still (in a loose sense of the word since I don't really believe in simple binaries). Our systems of inequality and oppression have a deeper toll on human life than overzealous social justice warriors. And I find it dubious that "social justice" has become a bad word. Justice is a good and social justice is a wonder that should be reached for. How we do this is a better conversation to be had. Activists are not bad people.¬†That said, I do agree that the way we've been talking about things isn't helping. But that is not because I think that activism is bad or that social justice warrioring is such a terrible thing. I just believe that too easily we cross the line from empathic criticality to rabid ideology.¬†We must always question, even ourselves, because there is no road map, and we will fall if we aren't watchful.¬†There is zeal on both sides, my friend.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@ArachnoscribeTrue, we don't all believe or preach the same things. And not all things are of universal appeal (though I feel like the five human needs (healthcare, food, etc.) should be afforded to all people). Because we cannot claim universality I am a proponent of panarchy. If we can't all agree why not shoot for peaceable diversity.I don't agree that this is what critical thinking is largely because it isn't the reason I critically think. I'm optimistic so let's just put this in the different dispositions category. We won't be able to go into the minds of other people to prove in either direction.As to your question, I think there's a few answers to this.I think a lot of \textbf{black} people would vote for a \textbf{black} candidate because they've never seen a \textbf{black} candidate before (for the president anyway). This, I think, is perfectly reasonable.Also, a \textbf{black} candidate would likely be a democrat (with some notable exceptions) and they would vote for someone who would be aligned with their worldview. A \textbf{black} candidate would likely align more than another.But this, I feel, is a complicated question. You are asking about a people that have never (until recently) seen a \textbf{black} candidate in office. White voters have seen whites in office since forever and this was in part due to \textbf{black} voters voting for those candidates. Why then is it not an issue when a \textbf{black} voter votes for a white candidate, but it is if they vote for a \textbf{black} one.A better question: why is it not questioned when white voters vote for white candidates?This is an altogether sticky issue. It is difficult to untangle people's motives. But even if a \textbf{black} person votes for a \textbf{black} candidate simply due to their blackness, we have to take into account that this isn't happening in a vacuum. Under-represented groups will likely vote for those that represent their groups, the same way dominants have historically done. But this is due to power inequalities that affect both sides and affect the judgments of both groups.I'd love if people voted according to other reasons. But honestly, when it comes to politics, there isn't much else to go on here. It is basically a popularity contest based on unproven promises. Presentation rules. The two-party system only provides the illusion of choices. There is so much wrong with the system as it stands, that the question of why blacks would vote for blacks is not even close to the most interesting question.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!27}11/425 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.588 \\  \hline

The remainder of America (or whatever it¬†would be called after the breakup) might be looking forward to military occupation or, at the very least, versions of siege warfare on an unprecedented scale in the Americas.There have been \textbf{black} politicians in this country for quite some time... It's difficult to believe that the novelty is still appealing.(It should somehow be passed along that a world existed before the founding of Philadelphia, and an accurate and unbiased portrayal of that world is paramount.)When it starts to become a modern trend for white people to vote for candidates primarily on the basis of apparent \textbf{ethnicity}, I will be the first in line to kick some ass. Until then, I will underscore the tendency (based upon verifiable statistics) for \textbf{African} Americans to champion members of 'the home team' even if the results are catastrophic.There is an historically gargantuan amount of political considerations to digest at this time, and popularity contests are cringeworthy. I have noticed a tendency for many to disregard policies (including statutes, which are available to anyone with even the most primitive data connection) in favor of¬†ideals with no¬†legal or practical basis.(I wasn't going for interesting.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Arachnoscribe\textbf{Black} politicians are rare outside of \textbf{black} communities.How we define "catastrophic" might be different. Plus, I find politics, white or \textbf{black}, to be equally horrible.Questions of home-teamship don't arise with white voters. Why is that? It could be said that they've been voting for their home-team since the dawn of the republic. Most of that time it was due to blacks not being able to run for office. And then not being able to vote. This issue of home teams could only be considered if we disregarded history. Since I don't, I find it difficult to understand the relevance of it.Voting for your home team makes perfect sense to me in the oppressive society we live in. It goes beyond novelty. We don't live in a society where pure merit is the basis for most things. And opportunity isn't evenly distributed. Thus, people would likely vote for the person that looks like them especially if their needs are underrepresented (and historically when their people are over-represented).So I remain unconvinced that home-teaming is the source of the problem. Inequality seems a more likely explanation.As for panarchy, my views are a bit more nuanced than I've highlighted. I don't believe panarchy can or even would happen from above. It would happen from the bottom up. It would be change from below. We'd have to work our way towards that in our collective consciousness. Because of this, I'm not confident it will be so in my life time.However, panarchy as a basis for grassroots work and radical thinking, that is well within reach. Movements could be panarchic.

If you think \textbf{black} people are humans, then there is a human explanation. What do you think it is?Earlier you said we were looking at it from different place/perspective. Where is your place? How are you looking at it? I'm also assuming, as part of communication that you are wishing to show me something. I'd like to know what that is.My belief is that \textbf{black} people are underrepresented and so they vote for people that will represent them and speak to their concerns. \textbf{Black} politicians often talk that talk to a subset of people starved for their own leaders. This doesn't seem to be a uniquely \textbf{black} motivation. Any group in that situation would do so, have done so. It is my opinion that \textbf{race} has always been a motivation in elections. The fact that most people don't see it that way is because it has been naturalized when it comes to voting for white leaders. It seems like a given when it really isn't. My point is, if blacks are guilty, humans are guilty, and the root cause is unequal system, that doesn't encourage voting beyond \textbf{race} due to inadequate representation and cultural narrow-mindedness.The fact that it is so difficult to communicate what \textbf{black}'s experience to the white dominant culture makes it unlikely that blacks will vote for members of this dominant culture when they have an option of voting for someone of their own social experience. This conversation is a good example of this. Despite how civil and wonderful our communication has been, it remains difficult for this experiential gap to be bridged. This, I believe is the root of the problem. Savvy \textbf{black} politicians can and do exploit this, but that isn't the root of the problem. It is merely an effect of the problem.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Ethnic, Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}9/348 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.586 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@elwynbrooks, this definition of \textbf{racism} stems from sociology and had branched out to other social sciences.  It is great to have the term to discuss institutional \textbf{racism} (like apartheid or \textbf{jim c\textbf{row}}).  However, there is a distinction I think is being missed.  Sociology studies groups, institutions, and societies... not individuals.  When we don't make that distinction (at best) we are having two separate conversations.  At worst, when we conflate this distinction, we lose the original meaning of the word.  For example, it is \textbf{common} now for someone to say "\textbf{black} people can't be \textbf{racist}," because they define \textbf{racism} as prejudice + power.  What is really being said is "an individual who is \textbf{black} can't be \textbf{racist}."  This is nonsense.  Any individual can be \textbf{racist}.  No individual (of any \textbf{race}) can implement institutional \textbf{racism}.... only a collective can (and in a typical hierarchy only a few in positions of power can make those decisions).  It would be correct to say "\textbf{black} people do not wield institutional \textbf{racism}."  Also of note, is the fact that simply because a collective does something, does not necessarily mean an individual who belongs to the collective has anything to do with it.  To state otherwise would be the fallacy of division: what is true for the whole must be true for all parts that make up the whole.  This is immensely important to understand, as it is the primary fallacy used in prejudice and \textbf{racism}.  For instance, someone who is \textbf{racist} might assume a \textbf{black} person is going to rob them simply because of their \textbf{race}.  If pressed on the matter, they might refer to crime statistics that show a much higher rate per capita of theft and robbery where the perpetrator is \textbf{black}, compared to other races.  Although the statistics cited are true, we instinctively KNOW this is wrong, and that they cannot assume something about an individual based upon \textbf{race}.  To be able to put a term to it; to understand the flaw in logic, is the best way to fight it.  The emphasis on collectives (and judging and punishing people based upon the group they are divided in) is the main problem I have with "social justice."  Justice is based upon an individual's actions, while social justice is focused on the collective.  Throughout history, this has ALWAYS led to atrocities.  A great example is how the Nazis treated Jews during WWII.  It did not matter whether the individual had done anything wrong, they are part of the collective, and therefore, must be punished.  If someone is punished for a crime they did not commit, or not held accountable for a crime they committed, this is by definition injustice.  Because of this, social justice (based upon collectives) is entirely at odds with justice, and will inevitably lead to injustice.  This is also an important concept to understand, because this is precisely how people attempt to justify violence against someone based upon their \textbf{race}.  By using the fallacy of division, and taking action against a person based upon group identity and not their actions, what they have done is unjust.  Going back to the original point of contention, to define all \textbf{racism} as "prejudice + power," is to redefine a word to fit an ideology, or a specific argument.  This is known as the fallacy of redefinition.  There are two very different terms (\textbf{racism} and "institutionalized \textbf{racism}") that are only appropriate in specific contexts.  When we conflate the meanings of words, and lose the nuance they convey, we also lose the ability to have a meaningful dialogue.  To go even further, and give an example that proves the flaw in logic, let's use the definition of \textbf{racism} as "prejudice + power."  We will imagine a small group of KKK members packs up their bags and moves to China.  In China, the white KKK members are a racial minority.  They also do not possess any institutional power, since all members of the government or institutions who could wield such power, are held by individuals who are Chinese.  Does this mean the KKK members are no longer \textbf{racist}?  Of course, the answer is no.  Therefore, we have to conclude that it is possible for someone to be \textbf{racist} without having institutional power.  In closing, I would like to point out that the same flaws in logic that are often used by racists, are the EXACT same fallacies used in social justice.  If we see these same fallacies in one instance lead to more division, hatred, and atrocities, is it not obvious we will see the same results?\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Common, Crow, Jim Crow, Race, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}28/760 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.684 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small A bigger issue is just the criminal justice system all together. ¬†They say you have a right to a trial by a jury of your peers but most cases rarely get that far. ¬†Say you are at a bar and some drunk gets inappropriate with your wife and you beat the crap out of him. ¬†Regardless of \textbf{race} you get arrested and they throw a huge list of any charges they can apply at you. ¬†Then they set bail which is usually unreasonable, so unless you have money you sit out the process in jail. ¬†The idea of throwing a ton of charges on you is so the DA can drop some of the charges to force you into a plea deal where you take a more serious charge than you deserve in most cases. ¬†Also to keep this initial deal on the table the DA will demand you waive your preliminary hearing where the judge could drop many of the stacked charges. ¬†All of this takes months so if you are stuck in jail it is all the worse, it is to ware you down, and the Public Defender is usually on some level not fighting as much for you but really playing along with the DA. ¬†They both will lie to you and try to scare you, the Public Defender will come and say you will be convicted in trial of all these charges and get the maximum sentence because you took it to trial (and wasted our time and money) so take this deal, get a felony, and we will put you on probation for years. ¬†This is the case unless you have the money for a private attorney that will truly fight for you. ¬†It is about money, and certain groups are at a disadvantage because of wealth disparity.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Race & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/303 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.33 \\  \hline

I think at that point you're not really looking at the opinion, but the skin color or \textbf{gender} of the person giving the opinion. It's like, well, ok, you make a good point, but you're white so get out. I think if you tell a person to get out, it should be because of something they did, not their skin color -- we should not rely on skin color to tell something about a person.What I am, of course, against, is people who are not willing to think about what a certain group goes through, or make assumptions about that group without attempting to put themself in their shoes. But just expressing an opinion in itself? Yes, if it's on-topic, I think that should be entirely fine.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/136 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.735 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Derek G¬†If the opinion is appropriate, thoughtful, respectful, and takes into account that there are certain elements of sensitive topics that they can't accurately know or appreciate because of the nature of their \textbf{race}, identity, or orientation, then you're absolutely right in saying that relevant discussion is fine.My point has less to do with "if you're [member of a group considered to be in a position of power over another group], you can't talk with us so go away," and more to do with, "the members of [marginalized group] may have very different experiences and perspectives about a topic that centres on them and the things they go through in direct relation to people that are a member of ["majority" group], and as such are more qualified to speak about those matters."Take, for example, discussion about transphobia in media. This is one that I, as somebody who isn't cis, am comfortable with and can exchange dialogue referencing my own personal experiences. There's no question that when it comes to trans issues, trans people have a lot more stake in the topic than someone who is cis. We've got important cis allies and they can occasionally provide good insight that aids in our discussion. This is fine and good and encouraged and not what I'm disputing at all.But at the end of the day, the trans community still goes through a lot of pain and suffering at the hands of cis people who are bigoted and dangerous. There are certain specific things about transphobia that cis people will never be able to understand because they have the privilege of being cis and being accepted because of that.¬†If a cis person takes an interest in trans issues and wants to educate others, then great! It's a wonderful thing!However, if a cis person talking about trans issues becomes widely-received and gets a lot of attention, what might at first be a good thing reveals a startling trend that most people aren't willing to listen to or participate in matters that concern a marginalized group until a member of the majority group dips their toes into the pool and gives their two cents on the subject. The exact same points made by somebody who is POC or trans get pushed aside in favour of what somebody white or cis has to say, which should not be what happens. My original reply was about using their voices to amplify what's already been addressed by members of an under-represented community rather than adding your voice to the mix and potentially drowning out somebody else who rightfully has more say.Maybe our opinions differ on this, and if there's something I'm missing, feel free to say so, but to sum things up: White people's thoughts on POC discussions have their place but should not be considered more important or meaningful coming from somebody who's white than from somebody with whom the issue actually concerns. If you are invited to share, then yes, by all means, but I personally feel that as somebody who may not experience oppression in the same way, it would not be my place to think that I can accurately speak for somebody else on matters of \textbf{race} in particular. If I was unclear in either of my expectations, then I want to correct that, but I hope that I got my point across adequately.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/567 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.353 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Your point is very much taken. Look, here's the thing. I think, sure, it's going to be more difficult for a person outside of the group to be correct because they have to infer things without experiencing them directly. But why assume anything? If a person expresses an opinion that makes sense, should we then reject once we find out that the person who said it isn't the right skin color?Sure, a person not in the group has to do guesswork, but that doesn't mean they can't be right. In any event it can go both ways. If, for example, we automatically assume the person in the group is right, then they have too much power.¬†What if, heaven forbid, someone in this group wanted to take advantage of this trust, and just make something up because they know they will be believed. I'm sure not many people want to, but I just don't think it's logical to put one's whole belief based on what the people of a group feel like telling you. It's not that they're lying, it's just that it's difficult to confirm what they say.I think what's more realistic though, is not so much that people in a group could outright lie, but more that they could stretch the truth. Maybe even unintentionally. Maybe the stress of the group being oppressed gives them a bias to exaggerate what they go through. Or maybe a few really bad experiences stick in their head and this makes them think they go through it more often than they do, or that there are more "bad" people out there than there are.So, at the end of the day, as I said earlier, I think it makes sense to judge the opinion itself, rather than the person. One could make some sort of guess, oh this person is \textbf{black}, so most likely they're right, well, ok, but to know for sure you might as well look at the content of their opinion too, not just make some guess based on the color of their skin.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!27}1/347 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.288 \\  \hline

The only reason I mentioned the fact that I'm not cis is to draw a comparison much like the issue of \textbf{race} to a topic I'm more familiar with. That's all. When you say that people need data for their claims, I can give you statistics till the cows come home but what you asked originally is a very subjective question that does not rely on hard evidence, but rather, subjective opinion. "Can [majority group] talk about [minority group] issues?" It is not the sort of thing you can sample from studies unless they are ones specifically geared toward gathering opinions.Also if you think that particular song from Avenue Q applies to this situation even a little bit, I'm sorry to say that I think you're very, very wrong. There are people (rare, but they do exist), who have or are in the process of unlearning a lot of toxic behaviour toward people of differing \textbf{race} and, shockingly enough, don't actually think it's cool or fun to demean and mock other people based on where they or their family were once from. People without a racial bias or who are actively correcting their racial bias are real, they exist, and to sweep \textbf{racism} under the rug as "just another thing we wacky humans do!" is not cute, it is not funny, and I am not impressed.I am officially taking my hat out of the ring and will respond to no more notifications regarding this, but I thought I should at least humour you with a reply seeing as you are the OP of a post I'd originally answered.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Yo, \@steamcastle , if an issue is actually affecting a group in particular, that group should talk about it, and \textbf{nobody} should speak over them. Usually with \textbf{sexism}, we are talking about the \textbf{patriarchy}, and how it oppresses women, and that the ways that it oppresses men, are still, yet another way, to oppress women. Though, if we're talking about men being domestically abused? Talking about men being sexually abused? All of these things that are hushed up because of the \textbf{patriarchy}, which, in this case, is actually hurting men quite a bit- yeah, men need to have their voices dominate the topic when their safety is in question.Just like how things are different from location to location; The Christian/Atheist dynamic is very different in the American south than it is in the American north, where in the south, Christians overpopulate the states and put their finger prints on all public government properties, and atheists, or any other person of any other religion for that matter, are more \textbf{common} to be given death threats by Christians, telling them they're going to hell, or beating them up. While in the north, it is the opposite, where atheists hold a superiority over Christians, claiming themselves to be the far intelligent group of people, and demonizing all Christians based on their religious extreamists, and making fun of their "imaginary friend" and the way they behave and etc, etc.So, definitely, certain things need to be accounted for but, generally speaking, if you're not the oppressed group, you probably should listen to those who are speak and amplify their voices. As a Southern Atheist, I can tell you in detail the treatment that I, and my other non-Christian friends, got for not worshipping their god in their particular way, or breaking one of their religions rules that shouldn't apply to people not-in-that-religion. However, I acknowledge that it's different in the north. While I can scream until my face is blue just ever detail about the religious issues in the south, if a Christian from the north started talking to me about their experiences living in the North, surrounded by people who are not Christian- I would never, ever speak over them. I would keep my mouth shut and I would listen. I would take their experiences as legitimately as I take my own. Their experiences with religious bigotry will of course be very different from my own. I also expect them to not invalidate my own experiences with it in the south.This was just a random example, since it's far less clean cut than "can cis people talk about trans issues", which is a far, far, far different area. \textbf{Sexism}? Yeah it effects all genders, and differently- but sorry, men shouldn't be talking over women on the issues of catcalling, and birth control pills (unless they're afab), and being murdered for rejecting a guy at a bar. Just like how women shouldn't speak over men about just how devastating rape culture is for a 11 year \textbf{old} boy who got raped, and how he was told he had to celebrate being raped, because man she was hot, or be silenced completely because "men can't get raped".See, what I'm doing here, when I'm addressing the issues of \textbf{sexism} is I am amplifying the voices of women, and I'm amplifying the voices of men, both in subjects where they're oppressed terribly. I'm repeating the concerns expressed by seperate men and women from these areas. I am not, however, giving my own opinion about a topic of which I am not directly affected in, and, if a male abuse victim came and corrected me, I would not argue. The same with if a \textbf{woman} came and corrected innaccurate representation of their issues. I would not speak over them.So yeah. That's why the answer is "yes but no" by \@Alexander Campbell ... It's complicated, but in short, if you are not the oppressed group, you do not get to speak about their experiences through your own opinions on the matter.

I don't expect her to believe something just purely based on what I say. I would try to give her reasons as best I could. Sure I might want her to give me some leeway, some benefit of the doubt, but I would understand if she was sceptical too.The way I see it, if that \textbf{woman} helps me see the things I face in a different way, I think that helps me.

Sure, whether or not they experience something personally will factor in to whether I believe them or not, but I don't want to make a hasty conclusion until I really see what they're trying to say. It is, indeed, possible that I will disagree with a person in the group, and agree with a person outside the group (and, of course, I might agree with the person in the group, and disagree with the person outside the group :) ).So I think those are two different things in a way.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Thanks for asking for clarification, I was starting to feel discouraged by this! :>By "talking over" I mean make your own opinions on other people's experiences more important that the other people in question- by the oppressed group in question.I'll make several examples of this at different levels of severity, because I think this is very important to understand.Autistic Person: It really sucks cause organizations like Autism Speaks treats autism as if it's a disease, or an impairment, or something that should be fixed. I'm autistic. If you take my autism away, I'll be a completely different person with a completely different personality. I don't want that!Parent of kid with Autism: But your autism is terrible! You'll have autism for the rest of your life- until we find a cure! I heard that this one kid learned how to act normal! Don't you want to be like that person? You'd be normal! And anyway what's the chances of getting that life threatening desiese? We are working very hard on finding a cure for you! You want this! Why are you autistic people so ungrateful!? Is it because of your autism?? Is that it? We'll fix you don't worry!Autistic Person: But... I don't want to be fixed.Parent: Yes you do! Autism is terrible! I've even seen you get depressed about it!Autistic Person: I get depressed about it because people who aren't autistic keep trying to make me feel inhuman, or like a child, or like I've got a disease and am really not normal.... It's how I'm being treated by you that makes me depressed.Parent: You don't know what you're talking about. You'll understand when you become a parent! Now, let me move on so I can tell other people without autism just how terrible it is to be you! We'll fix you, don't worry.In this example, we have somebody who is more sure about how autism makes autistic people feel, than the person who actually is autistic. The autistic person doesn't "know" what they want, but the person who isn't autistic decides they do instead.Now for a very mundane example. One without an oppressed group, but somebody who's experience on the topic is still getting talked over, to try to illustrate this in a way somebody who doesn't face so much oppression can grip onto, hopefully, more easily.Bus Driver: The drivers on the road make me so nervous. I have a dang stop sign attached to my bus, and yet, drivers still break the law and drive through anyway! I'm scared that one day one of these kids are going to get ran over...Driver: Nah, I'm sure you're overexadurating. Like, how many times has that even happened to you? Like, once maybe?? Don't make such a big deal out of something so small! No kid is going to get ran over, you're just overthinking it.Bus Driver: Okay, yeah, it's only happened to me twice this year, but it happened three times last year, and two times the year before... It might be 'too few' for you, but this is a serious issue. Kids cross the street all the time without looking, especially when they're meant to feel safe by laws enforced TO keep them safe.Driver: Maybe we should change the law then, and get rid of the sign all together? Then the kids will have to look before crossing!Bus Driver: You don't understand..! You're not a bus driver, you don't even work with kids.Driver: Well, I'll tell you! It would be easier on ME if you didn't have that sign and I didn't have to stop! And there's more drivers than there are kids. Don't you ever think about the drivers? Some get tickets you know!It's pretending, or acting like you know more about a situation than somebody who deals with it every day first hand.It's the "Let them eat cake!" idea where people with no understanding of the situation thinks it's so much easier than what it actually is, and it absolutely dumbfounds those who are being told it's easier than what it is.You might not see yourself being this person! You like to think that you're educated and you're intelligent and you can figure when people are over hyping their issues. You don't get why people are mad. It can even piss you off at that group of people saying that you don't get it.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small On the names in that study. Personally, if I am a recruiter for a company, and I see a name that is not "normal" on a resume and I am going through a bunch of different resumes (15+) I will probably stick odd names to the side and only come back to them after I've gone through the rest.Why? Because for me names like "Nikki", "Benji", "Unique", "Vicky", "Braylon", "Nevaeh", "Keshawn" and other similarly shortened or obviously made up names signal a, to be frank, trashy background. Honestly actual \textbf{african} names have a better impact than "Diamond", Hasana is better than Laquisha,¬†Kofi is more impressive than Jamal.If someone decides to name their kid Vicky, then give them the name Victoria and call them Vicky. If the kids name is Benji name them Benjamin and call them Benji. \textbf{Weird} name are just that. \textbf{Weird}.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small So what exactly is the solution here? In the example of the resumes with literally identical qualifications, with the exception of the names, can you really call that racial bias? If the people looking over the resumes are mostly white people, they're going to lean towards the names similar to their own cultures. Where as, if the people looking over the resumes were \textbf{black}, I bet you they would have leaned more towards the more \textbf{ethnic} names. So what exactly can be done here? It's going to take generations of people for things to even out. Otherwise you're going to have instances like with colleges, where they'll chose minority groups just to make their school look good, which isn't really fair either. Usually when I apply for things, I leave the \textbf{gender} and \textbf{ethnicity} spots blank if I can, because it's irrelevant information that has \textbf{nothing} to do with my abilities to do a task.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Ethnic, Ethnicity, Gender, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}5/155 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.226 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small It's important to remember that most white Americans are no longer \textbf{racist}, just as most American men are no longer sexist. The hateful few still may appear to be the loudest, but they are still just a small percentage of any group. The challenge now is to fight systemic \textbf{racism} and \textbf{sexism} -- outdated rules and habits within our systems that can disadvantage a person because of their \textbf{ethnic} roots, their \textbf{gender}, their \textbf{sexual} orientation or for other bogus reasons.This is not about elevating one group at the expense of another, or about one group being made to feel guilty for things that \textbf{nobody} today is responsible for -- it's about rewarding the things about all of us that really deserve to be rewarded and disregarding the things about all of us that don't really make any difference.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnic, Gender, Nobody, Racism, Racist, Sexism, Sexual & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}7/139 & \cellcolor{green!27}5.036 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I think its impossible for you to tackle \textbf{racism} without looking at all races and all angles. \textbf{Racism} isn't a scale to be balanced, you cant solve \textbf{racism} by only looking at one "\textbf{race}" (which most videos do when talking about \textbf{racism} - they talk more about issues faced by \textbf{black} people than other ethnicities). I saw a comment on a popular music video which says "holy shit this song is sung by a white boy??????????? wow ¬†amazing!". Now if we change the word white with \textbf{black} then suddenly you are marked as being derogatory and \textbf{racist}, but its perfectly fine to call a man a "white boy" surely something is wrong there. I've also saw another video where it was a little white girl doing an \textbf{African} remix of frozen and most the comments are asking why she wasn't \textbf{black}. Again, imagine this girl was \textbf{black} and people were complaining she wasn't white. And, because I'm a white man speaking about these problems automatically I'm being \textbf{racist} because of something my supposed ancestors did, is ridiculous.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I think that this take on \textbf{racism} was remarkably eye-opening compared to others. The majority of the statistics that were presented were much more about equality of opportunity instead of opportunity of outcome, and I think that in order to truly solve the problem of racial inequality we need to focus on equality of opportunity. The numbers about crime and jobs fit this description well, as did the healthcare ones to some extent, but I have a few discrepancies with the education statistics. First off, it's important to note that schools that are majority latino and \textbf{black} are typically in poorer areas just from the trouble we have had in creating that equality of opportunity among races in the past. Because of this, the schools in those areas would have less funding, which is arguably a flaw in the system, and then would be able to offer fewer of the courses that were described. Regarding health, I think that there could be a connection between poverty among minorities and factors like life expectancy. Overall though I thought that this was a fairly unbiased description of how \textbf{racism} actually is in the US, and I appreciated the treatment of the statistics, especially the acknowledgement of the presence of correlation, but not necessarily causation.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Racism & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/212 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.415 \\  \hline

Now hip-hop doesn't translate into being a criminal, but that's how it's viewed.I have seen many races including whites who get treated differently because of what they like. Hip-hop is sadly represented by negativity, violence, drugs, treating women poorly, etc.So when you see someone who looks like they embrace that, it can create this act of judging. The thing is almost everyone is guilty of this. If you see someone who is \textbf{skinny},wearing glasses, carrying comics, you might label them as a nerd. Or if you see someone in all \textbf{black}, chains on their pants, \textbf{colored} hair, you would label them gothic.There is also a small percentage that think what they hear in these rap songs are cool or should be emulated.

Example kids in white neighborhoods are using drugs in there garages and low crime rural areas as blacks are more likely to use in the streets or on corners of bad neighborhoods that are heavily patrolled by Police already hence the higher likely hood of arrest.. Also white kids are more likely to be respectful during arrest than urban kids that favor minorities.. So a basic MJ arrest turns into a mj possession and resistance without or with violence there for the longer sentence...Not saying there is not a problem of inequality because is quite obvious that there is we all know this.. But I thinks its more the responsibility of parents to educate there kids and teach respect and responsibility to the kids...

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I just want to say that while I agree with much of this video, I think the idea of class and wealth disparity trumping \textbf{race} cannot be stressed enough. In every work environment I've ever seen save one (which was explicitly and unabashedly \textbf{racist}) a \textbf{black} person in a suit would get a job over a white person in "poor looking" clothes with the same skill set. Similarly, judges, prosecutors and police are, in my experience, far more likely to give a pass to a \textbf{black} person who looks and sounds well-educated than a white person who looks and sounds like a high school dropout from the inner city.The problem (as you allude to) is almost entirely the association between \textbf{race} and socioeconomic status, both in reality and in perception (which I think you'll find is why there was so much disparity in the handling of those resumes... not that Jammal sounds "\textbf{black}" but that it sounds "poor" or "inner city"). If we can shift \textbf{black} communities out of poverty (not merely make poverty more comfortable) I think we can actually make the end of most \textbf{racism} in America a reality.So, to that end here are some ideas:1. Stop emphasizing teaching inner city kids what they need to get through high school standardized testing. Teach them what they need for life. Teach them to measure risk/reward; to understand finance and the time-value-of-money; etc.2. Give more technology tools to youth in these communities.

Since when?) but then ignore that the majority of Asians also live in major metropolitan areas, such as San Francisco, New York City, Seattle, Los Angeles, which are also by numbers some of the most expensive cities in the country. Not to mention the Japanese concentration camp (Jewish Death Camp... let's call it what it is), and then the killing of Vincent Chin because he was Chinese, mistaken for Japanese...People often mistake \textbf{racism} for only \textbf{black} and white, and talk about \textbf{black} civil rights leaders, but then ignore civil rights leaders from other groups.

The core issue of \textbf{racism} is the social isolation of people who are weak and different, who then come together over projecting blame onto others for this.Institutional \textbf{racism} is different, as most who do it are not even racists, but they get racially charged data, and then they make a rational choice based on the data they have. If the statistical data says \textbf{black} people are X, Y and Z, and that is the only data they get, well then that is factored in, when they decide who to hire.This is not about data and truth, but about discourses and perceptions. Certain group have certain social stereotypes and those affect everyone in that group. And it is not just up to everyone else to accept that. It is also the job of that group to fight their negative stereotype.As I see it from outside the US (it is pretty much the same everywhere), the wast majority of both the majority and the minorities are not will to put in the proper effort to look inside themselves for what they can change, and people just blame society instead of thinking about that they are a part of that society.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Racism, Xenophobia & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}4/271 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.476 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Part of the problem is that, for the most part, we're speaking two different languages when it comes to \textbf{racism}. For people who believe in the system, citing statistics on \textbf{black} conviction rates and criminal sentencing can reinforce rather than tear down preconceptions.We can't eliminate bias, we're certainly not going to in the next two decades. The best avenue for reducing police violence against the \textbf{black} community is to remove legal burdens on all of society, rather than trying to pass laws to make current laws more fairly adjudicated. When police enforce ordinances against non-violent crime, it brings violence to an otherwise peaceful situation (as the primary tool of all law is the use of force and coercion.) Ending the drug war, reducing regulations, and lifting unnecessary laws (such as the one that prompted the confrontation between Eric Garner and police) will level the field more than positive legislation ever could.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Racism & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/152 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.974 \\  \hline

In education boys lag behind, which is gleefully celebrated by feminists who allegedly just want \textbf{gender} equality.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small "There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics."While it is somewhat refreshing to see that you've attempted to make an argument that is backed up with facts instead of emotion, I must say that your conclusion that \textbf{racism} is the underlying reason is a hasty one. While I agree that a small few of these studies could be used to support your point I disagree with the vast majority of it. Some of your arguments I took issue with because they were immediately noticeable to me as being illogical, while others require careful deliberation not worthy of a YouTube comment.The more illogical of them are as follows..."\textbf{African} Americans are far more likely to be stopped and searched"Because the average \textbf{black} person is more likely to be criminal. In almost every Police Department across America, police are required to meet some sort of quota. They simply choose the most likely person who is going to get their quota filled. Are the police profiling based off of \textbf{race}? Of course they are. But to assume it's out of some hatred of \textbf{black} people is illogical. If the facts had shown that Asians committed a significant portion of the crime in the United States, Asians would be pulled over. It is not at all unique to \textbf{black} people. Don't like it? Participate in your community and voice your desire to change how the current system works. So long as quota's exist, profiling will exist in noticeable numbers."although the contraband hit rate is higher among white people"Because Whites are only stopped when there is a more concrete reason to suspect there is something wrong."Those wrongfully convicted and later exonerated by DNA are disproportionately \textbf{African} American"So what? Take a look at the source you posted. Look at all 383 cases. The vast majority of the convictions were made in the 80's and early 90's, which was decades ago. How is this supposed to support your argument that there is a \textbf{racism} problem in 2015?"\textbf{Black} kids are far more likely to be tried as adults and more likely to receive life sentences"So what? Nowhere in the article does it state that whites who have committed the same crimes that warranted this punishment received a less severe punishment blacks."Emily and Brendan are more hirable than Lakisha and Jamal" [LINK] You seem to love the socioeconomic approach so let's apply it to this situation. Lakisha and Jamal are names associated with low income and ghetto culture, while Emily and Brendan are not. I highly doubt that if the names had instead been Xavier and Jasmine (top 20 blackest names, see source above), the results would be the same. I'd also wager that if the white names were Dustin and Brandy, you'd see similar trends."High schools with mostly \textbf{African} American and Latino students are less likely to offer courses in Algebra II or Chemistry than high schools with mostly white students"So what? These courses are not offered because the students are not taking them. If you had bothered to read your article, you'd see that when the classes were offered, \textbf{black} students took them at significantly lower rates then Whites and Asians. If there is \textbf{nobody} to take the course, then it won't be offered. This can't be blamed on \textbf{racism}. It's the fault of the students alone."And this story discusses the fact that \textbf{African} American students are more than twice as likely to be suspended as white students--even in preschool."Once again, this is just a simple fact. If you want to interpret it as evil \textbf{whitey} keeping the brothas down, well you can go ahead, but it doesn't have much merit. White supremacists could use this statistic to say that \textbf{black} children are inherently more disobedient then white children. The statistic by itself doesn't anything, I'm not sure why you bothered to post it at all."More info on increasing disparities in life expectancy between \textbf{black} and white people in the US:  [LINK] Once again, another plain fact that you somehow seemed to have construed into \textbf{racism}. \textbf{Black} people have higher rates of obesity, heart disease, etc. Of course they are going to die quicker then white people. \textbf{Black} people alone are to blame for that, unless you are insinuating that the evil white man is forcing them to eat fast food and drink soda.I should say again, I disagree almost entirely with this video.

The thing that strikes me the most is the fact that Cosmopolitan, a magazine about fashion and "celebrities" and sometimes health (who am I kidding, it's just about dieting) , anyway something that women of al races are intrested in, has a "regular" version and a latino one (I don't know if there are more, but if there are it just make it worse). Even on their online page they have articles directed only for latinas, and it gets me thinking... are latinas not allowed to read whatever they want without someone telling them "this is the content disigned for you so read this". And every latina article deals with a stereotype, many are just lists of stereotypes, and then you get the ones where they complain about the stereotypes...they are the ones enforcing them!!!

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Indeed \textbf{racism} is nuanced and I believe a more nuanced discussion is needed.¬†0:25 You use the word systemic; that is debatable. If you mean to say that \textbf{racism} happens within the system, I agree with you; it does because there are \textbf{racist} people in the world and some make it into positions of power and decision making. But what I think you mean to say is that \textbf{racism} is a product/outcome of the system itself. That I disagree with. You used systemic broadly in this case to mean economic, political, and justice systems; and in these cases the inequality that exists might be better explained with the history of \textbf{race} (not necessarily \textbf{racism} now) and the way that wealth relates to power. You're going to see me say this a lot: we need to control for wealth of the individual, family, and/or community before we can confidently suggest \textbf{racism} is the cause of an inequity.¬†0:37 Control for wealth.¬†0:52 Control for wealth.¬†0:59 Again, control for wealth. Either way though, stop and frisk laws promote discrimination as the subject of the stop is subject to any of the law enforcement officials biases with no oversight.¬†1:14 You could make a few arguments here. You could say the reason that blacks are exonerated more is due to the fact that blacks are charged/convicted/sentenced to death in higher proportions, and whether or not that has to do with \textbf{racism}. You could say that there is more concern about false convictions due to \textbf{race}, so blacks get exonerated more because their¬†cases get looked at more. In any case I'd like to see more data.¬†1:19 Control for wealth.¬†1:24 and 1:43 Fair enough. It is in our best interest in all cases to account for possible influencing factors in cases like this, and it seems in this case \textbf{race} was the chief and possible sole factor in this huge discrepancy. Now we must ask ourselves what sort \textbf{racism} was at play here; an intentional malevolent \textbf{racism}, an unintentional \textbf{racism}, or perhaps some other \textbf{racism} that doesn't quite fit in the other categories. The sort or \textbf{racism} at fault will dictate what our response should be. If it is intentional then some systematic change or punishment must take place. If it is unconscious then exposure normalization of \textbf{race} and working towards a post racial society should be our goal.¬†2:15 Again, control for wealth. Most schools are funded by property tax.¬†2:31 Control for wealth.¬†The reason that I am so focused on wealth inequality is because I am concerned about equality as a whole. I fear that we are focusing so much on \textbf{race} that we are failing to address where the majority of inequality steams from: wealth. It's not that \textbf{racism} isn't something to be concerned about, but we assume it in cases of suspected inequality to the exclusion of other factors.

Unlike America or Europe blacks get openly discriminated and not even the state cares about that. Businesses will deny you services or jobs simply because of the color of your skin.The difference is that this kind of discrimination was \textbf{nation} and not \textbf{race} based. Europe had a strong sense of \textbf{nationalism} and folk hence why you see people referring themselves as Irish-Americans or German-Americans while blacks get the summarized Afro-Americans due to blacks living rather tribal and never developing nations. Also blacks have been persecuted/oppressed by nearly everyone due to their low technological level which made them a punching bag. Starting with the egyptians who regulary used to fight against the numidians, to blacks that were carried to europe as servants to arabs who enslaved them. And don't forget that Africa, when it was left alone, wasn't that happy dandy land either. It was in a state of constant tribal battles.From all the right wind ideologies, why do you use the one who is the most left?The Asians faced merciless \textbf{racism} during the 20th century in America but where are they now?

The political and economic changes that came with the end of apartheid are more complicated than "white people were better rulers". They basically restarted the government, which is no easy task.

However, the fact of the matter is that the only ways to fix the system are by giving blacks preferential treatment in jobs, healthcare, and the justice system. This is obviously not real equality. As far as education, at least where I live, \textbf{black} schools are very unsafe and spend more of their money on security and basketball arenas than they actually do on education. The buildings are falling apart except for the metal detectors. This is probably really due to lower socioeconomic opportunity causing a higher crime rate and the gang affiliations that go with it. We should really be focusing on the plight of the smart, well-mannered kids that do everything they can to learn in one of these unsafe and essentially unaccredited schools. The solution to the problems of the racial inequality in the US is to educate the children on the subject and wait for the \textbf{racist} older generations to pass.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I don't think systemic \textbf{racism} doesn't exist. But I think it's highly reciprocal. In the vast majority of cases, the average white american can't do very much to stop it. It's very specific people, with very specific roles in society that have all the power. From the experience of a white person - if a \textbf{black} person is more likely to commit crimes, steal from the workplace, whether out of poverty of culture, people will generalize. The bias isn't just in peoples heads, it's because of the whole socioeconomic status of \textbf{african} americans. And \textbf{african} americans are often quite \textbf{racist} to white people back. While not systemic or organizational in nature, this absolutely does not help. Because if white people were to see how victimized \textbf{black} people were, they might want to be more willing to give them more changes. But due to cultural differences, they see drug use and poverty as a reason not to help them, not as a reason to. And while white people do inherit more land and wealth across generations, there is no ethical reason to offer that wealth to someone else because of \textbf{race}. That is also \textbf{racism}. Also, did you know that an overwhelming number of slave owners were \textbf{african} american, including the very first one in the united states?¬†Also, did you know there were white slaves, as well as \textbf{black}?Slave ownership was a thing in Africa, amongst \textbf{black} Africans, long before it was ever perpetuated in the United States. If we're talking about whose to blame for historical reasons, the argument that white people are indebted to \textbf{black} people is a very weak one. Additionally, the wealth experienced by \textbf{black} people, while proportionally lesser than the wealth experienced by white people, is still far higher than what it would been if slavery had not been there to build the economy during the earlier years of the United States. Modern \textbf{African} Americans, while benefitting less than white people, are still benefitting hugely from what the slaves actually did for the US economy.inb4 white people, brainwashed into feeling guilty, discredit my argument as being \textbf{racist}.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African, Black, Race, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}15/354 & \cellcolor{green!5}4.237 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I keep seeing this argument that \textbf{racism} against white people doesn't exist. ¬†You cannot be serious when you say that. ¬†Look at Ashkenazi (European) Jews. ¬†Look at how mean people still are to the Polish. ¬†My great-grandmother said that her grandparents came to America from Poland (part of the German Empire at the time) and when they would walk down the street people would say, ¬®Look at those \textbf{dumb} pollacks.¬® ¬†I am sick and tired of the term reverse \textbf{racism}. ¬†Reverse \textbf{Racism} implies that \textbf{racism} has a single \textbf{race} as a victim and a single \textbf{race} as a perpetrator of it. ¬†That belief is \textbf{racist} in and of itself. It sickens me to think of how divided we are by racial lines in America. ¬†Racial lines are imaginary lines that are made real by people such as Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson. ¬†Racial division is a problem that we have brought upon ourselves by creating false narratives. ¬†The ¬®Hands Up, Don't Shoot¬® protests were based on a concocted story that the witness retracted and has since been disproved. ¬†\textbf{Racism} in all of it's forms is one of the most evil sins one can commit. ¬†As someone who has been marginalized at some times due to Autism, I cannot say that there is no discrimination in America. ¬†There is discrimination against \textbf{Race}, Disability, and a number of other things that people think of as ¬®different.¬® ¬†I understand what people go through when discriminated against. ¬†I have been discriminated against for my Autism by many teachers in my past. ¬†Many teachers would send me out in the hall for problems that I couldn't control at the time and I would get bullied in the hall by kids who had \textbf{nothing} but a \textbf{black} heart. ¬†I also had plenty of friends to that helped me along the way. ¬†I do not think we should focus on the bad in society, but we should focus on the good in society. ¬†When the evil in society loses influence it will ultimately fade away. ¬†Whenever I have a situation where I am discriminated against I can advocate for myself because I have taken classes about self advocacy. ¬†I have had to take classes just to understand how a proper conversation works. ¬†So that is why I hate it when people whine about discrimination. ¬†Do like I did, quit whining and advocate for yourself. ¬†Even better yet, move yourself out of that toxic situation. ¬†I ended up having to switch schools but it was the best decision I have ever made. ¬†People need to stick up for themselves and realize that not all white people are \textbf{racist}, not all cops are bad, not all \textbf{black} people are criminals, not all \textbf{disabled} people look injured or intellectually impaired, and not all people are bad. ¬†there are many more good people in this world than bad people. ¬†Whenever I feel marginalized or discriminated against, either because of my disability or my christian faith, ¬†I read the Beattitudes.Mathew 5:3-12He said:3 'Blessed are the poor in spirit,¬† ¬† for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.4 Blessed are those who mourn,¬† ¬† for they will be comforted.5 Blessed are the meek,¬† ¬† for they will inherit the earth.6 Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,¬† ¬† for they will be filled.7 Blessed are the merciful,¬† ¬† for they will be shown mercy.8 Blessed are the pure in heart,¬† ¬† for they will see God.9 Blessed are the peacemakers,¬† ¬† for they will be called children of God.10 Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness,¬† ¬† for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.11 'Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me. 12 Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Disabled, Dumb, Nothing, Race, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}15/653 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.297 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Well as you said, it was only four minutes. I think that the issue of \textbf{racism} is so inherent within American History that it will be almost impossible to have a clear, honest discussion about its effects among open-minded people. However, this (at least to me) makes that goal all the more worthwhile.¬†Much of the denial among the white population can be attributed to the fact that so many white people live in parts of the country that have very low percentages of other \textbf{ethnic} groups. Take for example, the Midwest and Central Unites States, the majority of their residents are white, therefore how could they come to understand the issue of \textbf{racism} as deeply as white populations in Southern, Northeastern, and Northern parts of the country. It is as if they look at this issue from a not-so-distant, but just far enough away place that they are shielded from any of its direct effects. Yes, they do encounter other \textbf{ethnic} groups and co-exist, but these encounters are so few and far between that it creates an environment like that of The Truman Show. They are protected from the issues and any problems that they encounter are easily overlooked because it would be too troublesome to bother to find out what is at the root of the issue.¬†Another key factor is that white people simply don't have this \textbf{race} conversation among one another nearly as much as their \textbf{ethnic} counterparts do. You rarely ever hear people complaining "I didn't get the job because I am white". They are not hindered by the color of their skin. Instead they are enabled to pursue their goals with substantially more freedom (as shown by the study you provided). This is what is known as "white privilege". It is something that is often overlooked and sadly, even denied outright. Among blacks, Hispanics, Asians, etc. \textbf{race} is something that is undeniably a factor in your life. To an extent, your \textbf{ethnicity} comes along with certain preconceptions that you must struggle to overcome. It is an essential part of your identity. This is why there are a certain amount of expectations even within these communities and their people. If these expectations are not met then you are no longer considered to be "\textbf{black} enough" or "Spanish enough" ¬†or whatever ¬†the case may be. Comparatively, whites come with more of a clean slate. It's like the lack of color on their skin represents a lack of preconceived notions about their origins and their past. They are not as easily as classified and filed away as people of color are. It is not that whites have something we people of color do not, it is what they don't have that allow them to advance easier without having to constantly be pigeonholed . While there are stereotypes of white people, these typecast aren't nearly as overbearing and taxing as ours are (at least as far as I have seen).¬†Furthermore, the complicated history of \textbf{race} relations within the United States has made so many of these stereotypes so intrinsic within its people that they no longer even know that they have bias. The job study you provided is also a good representative of this. Who is to say that the people who were hiring were \textbf{racist}? I would bet that the majority of these people are tolerant, open-minded people that have never been discriminatory toward someone due to their \textbf{race}. It is just that these prejudices have been hammered into the American psyche through centuries of struggle within its people. This is perhaps the most depressing of all the roots behind \textbf{racism}. People truly and honestly claim to be fair-minded people, but when looking at their actions they are met with a saddening revelation that deep inside they do have some bias. Rather than confront this issue head-on, many simply brush it under the rug, denying it as something of pure coincidence. I think this is why many people believe (naively) that \textbf{racism} is no longer an issue. When Americans think of \textbf{racism} they envision Southern \textbf{Jim C\textbf{row}} Laws banning \textbf{black} and white children from sharing the same schools. They see it as overt and undeniable. However, the \textbf{racism} that is being dealt with now is the \textbf{racism} that was being dealt with by people of color who lived in the false havens of the North and Southwest United States. It is the type of prejudice that allows a white \textbf{woman} to share a seat with a \textbf{black} man on a bus, but at the same time almost instinctively tells that \textbf{woman} to hold her purse just a tad bit tighter than she would have had it been a white person.This is also not just a problem between whites and other \textbf{ethnic} peoples, \textbf{race} is something that has cut clearly across all groups of different colors. To imply that it is an issue just among two groups would be a vast oversimplification of a layered and deep problem among the American people. It is simply that whites have and continue to be the biggest group in denial of the issue. The trouble is that this is the group with the most influence within America. Congress is run by a vast majority of white people and Fortune 500 Companies follow the same exact trend. Historically, throughout not just America's History but the history of the world during the past several centuries, this has been true. Whatever the reason for this imbalance of power has been, we have come to a point where we have all (mostly) agreed that we are all equal and share rights that are universal to humanity. While the most blunt and violent opposition to this agreement has been quelled the aftereffects remain. The lingering fear and unintentional prejudice remains. Are we going to continue to pretend that it isn't there are and falsely claim that the ideal has been reached even though in reality it may never be obtained because by definition it exist only in our minds? Or is it the time to honestly look at ourselves and our culture and recognize that just because we cannot see the wounds that have been left by our ancestors, the scars remain and although they may wane they will never entirely fade. ¬† ¬†¬†Sorry for the long comment, this is a topic that I am very passionate about (may have been hard to tell) :).\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Crow, Ethnic, Ethnicity, Jim Crow, Race, Racism, Racist, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}25/1070 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.336 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Lets start by saying that yes, there is \textbf{racism} out there, but the extent that \textbf{race} plays a role in all of these issues is blown WAY out of proportion, and, in most cases, \textbf{race} is just a pointless correlation that doesn't hit the real problem: Wealth disparity.¬†The growing issue of wealth disparity explains pretty much all of these issues, and the rest are pointless correlations. White people are more likely to be rich so their health care is better, their schools are better, and they are more likely to have a competent lawyer get them a reduced sentence for the same crime as a poor person.Racial profiling is indeed an issue for poor minorities living in areas like LA and NYC. Still, it's a socioeconomic problem and not a \textbf{race} one. Cops in these cities spend more time in the poor areas, because that's where the violent crimes happen, and there are many minorities in these areas. I guarantee white boys hanging out in the ghettos are getting profiled by those same cops.¬†The issue with \textbf{ethnic} names is addressed pretty well in the book Freakonomics, I suggest reading it or watching the Netflix movie. Basically, if you want your child to succeed in life, don't give them a name like Lakisha or Unyque, because it is a \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} flag for employers for reasons other than \textbf{race}. Anyway, with things the way they are now, it is MUCH worse to have a middle eastern sounding name. Damn ISIS ruining things for Muslims everywhere.The study about \textbf{black} and white ex-convicts trying to get employment was done by a grand total of 4 students, 2 white and 2 \textbf{black} (seriously, read the study), proving \textbf{nothing} other than the possibility that the 2 \textbf{black} students were slightly worse at job interviews? What a pointless study.The article about \textbf{black} college grads having a harder time than whites at getting work is pointless because it doesn't provide what their majors were in college, what college they went to, what fields they are trying to get employed in, where they are looking for work, etc. just another pointless correlation involving skin color. For all we know, there is a disproportionate number of minorities getting liberal arts degrees (\textbf{African} American studies, anyone?), and then wondering why white grads with engineering degrees get all the jobs. Or maybe they just didn't do as well in school, or went to a less reputable school? We'll never know, the article doesn't address any of these things, it just tries to make a blanket statement implying inherent \textbf{racism} in employers.¬†The study he linked comparing \textbf{black} and white mortality rates is a 15 year \textbf{old} study‚Ä¶ based on information from the years 1940-1999, to do an estimate about what the year 2010 might look like. So beside the fact that the data is \textbf{old} and pointless, this is a just a correlation that doesn't take into account differences in lifestyles and socioeconomic statuses (lets think about this logically: who lives longer, poor people or rich people?). This is the same as the health care issue‚Ä¶ without socialized medicine, poor people will suffer, and in ‚ÄòMurica, unfortunately, minorities are the poorest.¬†TL;DR: being poor sucks.I would argue that it is better to be a minority from the middle or upper class than a white person in the lower class living in the ghetto, getting harassed by cops and going to those shitty schools, and whats worse, with affirmative action working against your chances to succeed.but hey, that's just my opinion. but its right.

If blacks really are targeted more and hated more by people then how come the majority of blacks think the recent cases in which \textbf{black} men died are stupid because of other blacks calming its a \textbf{race} thing?2. What is "white" in these studies? Is it anyone NOT with \textbf{black} skin? Most people say there are latinos, asians, whites and blacks. But "whites" is a term that never made sense to me. If I am german I am not white for example. What I mean is there are many "white" skinned people in america but these studies need to break down whites into \textbf{ethnic} groups. Maybe some groups are more prone to being \textbf{racist} then others. I know alot of people in america come from england for example. Are they more \textbf{racist} then lets say german-americans?¬†Because if you clump all white skinned ethnicities together then obviously the stats will seem slanted.

The \textbf{race} card thing and the "white privilege" thing is BS. If whites really had privilege then how come blacks pretty much have whites by the balls? Blacks open \textbf{black} only schools, pageants....etc. If a white person does that the NAACP is all over it and makes sure it doesn't happen. If you even look at a \textbf{black} person wrong they yell out \textbf{racism} and can get you removed from a job or in trouble.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I think a reason that \textbf{race} has continued to be an issue in the United states is partially because of how the issue is approached.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small John, couldn't agree more with this well stated¬†video. However, there is one point I would like to add. The key to eradicating this \textbf{racism} that is very real in our country is providing a quality public education to ALL Americans. It is no coincidence that many of the worst schools (lowest¬†standardized test scores, high teacher turn over rates, high drop our rates) are in the poorest and most \textbf{African} American areas. A group of people that has been systematically oppressed for hundreds of years cannot be given the bare minimum and expected to compete with those who have been given everything for hundreds of years. Though there is a real problem with our criminal justice system that needs to be addressed.

I'm not raciest against blacks and I think this info is all fine and dandy but after America saw what happened in ferguson, I think we did our research. I have recently watched a video as a school presentation about 10 misconceptions of Israel and Palestine and I can't explain how this topic is over 10x more important than blacks being arrested more in America.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I find it sad and disheartening that people are turning the issue of police abuse into a \textbf{race} issue. ¬†It is depressing to hear people go on about how police have justified killing people who "look like me", meaning \textbf{black} people. ¬†It shows a profound lack of understanding of the issue and the problems that society is truly facing right now. ¬†Allowing this sort of ignorance to divide people into groups, and miscast this very serious accountability problem as a \textbf{race} problem will only have one outcome: ¬†further pain and suffering.Further pain and suffering is the only possible outcome of turning this into a \textbf{race} issue.This is not a \textbf{race} issue. ¬†That doesn't mean there isn't a racial component, but \textbf{race} is not the problem here. ¬†The problem is how society has bent itself around in such a manner as to hold people in a position of power unaccountable. ¬†Rather than forcing police to comply with the highest standards of professionalism, we, as a society, have allowed police to fall to a standard of "I thought I was doing the right thing." ¬†I thought is not a professional standard. ¬†Opinion is not a professional standard. ¬†When you allow people to fall to these low standards, you will always have abuse. ¬†And the first people abused are the people with the least ability to fight back. ¬†That is where the racial component comes into play. ¬†People who are lower class, of a minority, mentally ill, or any other of a long list of potential risk factors are more likely to be abused by the system. ¬†But the fact that those people are more likely to be abused isn't the issue. ¬†The fact that the system allows abuse in the first place is the problem. ¬†If you were to "fix" the racial component overnight with the wave of your magic wand, all you would end up doing is shifting who the victims are. ¬†There would still be victims. ¬†Probably the exact same number of victims, but they would be a slightly different demographic. ¬†We need to address the actual issues here. ¬†The underlying problem is what you need to fix or \textbf{nothing} will ever get better. ¬†And just so I state this plainly: ¬†\textbf{race} is not a factor in police being held unaccountable in deaths of people. ¬†Police kill people of every \textbf{race} every single day. ¬†2,3,4 people per day are kill by police. Police are almost never held accountable. ¬†I remember a case of a cop shooting a young boy who opened a door holding a wii remote. ¬†I remember a case of police beating a mentally ill man to death while he screamed for his daddy to help him. ¬†Police kill people every single day. ¬†\textbf{Race} is irrelevant to this fact. ¬†\textbf{Race} may, and I stress may, play a roll in who is targeted. ¬†But it absolutely does not play a roll in the fact that police get away with killing people on a daily basis. ¬†The problem is this lack of accountability, not which demographic is more likely to be the victim. ¬†We should be aiming at \textbf{zero} victims, not an even racial makeup of victims.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Nothing, Race, Zero & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}12/529 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.268 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small So. I am \textbf{black}. XD (How could ya tell?) And I am glad this video was made. Like John said,¬† I really think the most important thing is to listen to peoples stories. Yeah, there are statistics, but like he said, there are other factors involved. (More below.)My experiences with \textbf{race} range from funny to ridiculous/funny/sad simultaneously. It is subtle, but I see it when I walk with my white guy friend and get dirty looks from the local white suburb folk (I thought I was being . . .overly sensitive, but my friend even pointed it out). And then, on the flip side, a \textbf{black} guy asks me out, I say no, and he gives me a dirty look and says, out loud in a store, I probably only date white guys. XD When I come in for an interview after being on the phone, and they're looking around for the not \textbf{black} girl., because my voice does not match my skin color. In high school, a girl said to me that she did not believe in a \textbf{black} president, because she was not raised that way.I have a ten year \textbf{old} (very smart) little brother, and I kind of worry that people will..be suspicious of him as he gets older. Actually, once last year, we were in an area that was mostly white, at the store, and a (white) mother pulled her child away from my brother (they were playing a game at a Best Buy), and gave us a dirty look. At the same time, I wonder if he will be considered...negatively by his \textbf{black} peers, because nerdy/smart/polite is not¬† "how \textbf{black} person should act" (internalized \textbf{racism} is a completely different, and uglier, animal). I got that a lot growing up, as early as ten years \textbf{old}.These situations¬† are more instances of prejudice than \textbf{racism}, but the latter stems from the former.So yeah. . .prejudice and \textbf{racism}?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Thank you John for talking about this issue without alienating any other groups in this process (such as people perceived to have privilege).

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small So I claim to not be \textbf{racist}. Generally because I have \textbf{black} friends. However I may be without even thinking about it. I don't have any \textbf{black} friends who fit into the category of what most (white people) think of typical \textbf{African} American culture. They don't speak in Ebonics (they just have southern accents due to them being from the south), they don't wear clothes that are too big and "sag" They are just "normal" people. This in of itself shows that \textbf{racism} may indeed be ingrained in people. But the truth of the matter is that when the majority of \textbf{black} people I personally meet act and talk in a certain manner it's extremely difficult not to label the rest like them. Though in reality for me it may not have anything so much to do with the color of their skin and more to do with the culture built up around the color of their skin. I don't have a problem with \textbf{black} people in general. However, the moment I hear someone "talking ghetto" or the like I get uncomfortable and I could never be friends with someone who talks or acts that way white or \textbf{black} or any other \textbf{race}. I don't do it out of maliciousness or that I think I'm better or just to be mean it's more like I am trying to protect myself from falling in with the "wrong" crowd or with people who my personal safety might be put in jeopardy. Now remember this is all my feelings and opinions. Not backed up with any data or anything. Just experiences I have had meeting \textbf{black} people. In my view there are normal people and people I don't associate with. It may not have anything to do with \textbf{race} at all. I don't know for sure though. I asked one of my \textbf{black} friends his opinion and he said "people are people and some of them are shitheads".

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The only thing I don't like about this video is that he kept on saying "\textbf{African} Americans".

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small One subject that I think many studies fail to address when comparing the prison sentences given for similar crimes is the concept of wealth. ¬†Due to the higher volume of blacks in lower class areas, many cannot afford the more high end lawyers that many white clients are able to obtain. ¬†This is not \textbf{racist}, but merely me stating a fact based on the difference in social stature between the two races. ¬†Overall, with this being said the argument that blacks receive longer sentences may still be valid, but is much more questionable.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/93 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.075 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Thanks for posting this, John, and for discussing the issues of systemic \textbf{racism}/racial bias in a way that encourages Nerdfighteria and others to become more aware of the issue and discuss it as well. Unfortunately, as other people in the comments have said, there is no easy fix here but awareness and conversation about how \textbf{racism} in America still exists is a start. I think it's interesting and very relevant that you brought up the increasing gap in economic equality between racial groups.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small While I do believe you make a wonderful point and I agree with you that there is most definitely \textbf{racism} in the United States, but I don't believe that all of the \textbf{racism} is white people attacking \textbf{black} people. What I'm saying is that it doesn't need to just be an effort from one party. It must be an effort from both. We need to let go of bad history and make our own, as human beings white, \textbf{black}, Hispanic, or any other \textbf{ethnicity}.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small From my vantage point, I opine that the predominant reason why \textbf{racism} is still alive is that we as a species haven't fully evolved yet. We can assert all day as to¬†how we are all the same under the membrane called skin that holds our body in one piece; however, the truth is that most of humanity gravitate towards other bipeds who look similar to them. I said "most" because, we all encounter the few people who belong to that rarefied strata of our species who have already evolved past that stage and are truly devoid of any racial biases. I am not trying to impose a harsh indictment on humanity and neither am I¬†painting a hopeless picture of the state of affairs. Instead, I am optimistic that a large swath of humanity (if not most) will have evolved past our prejudices in the future. As to when that will happen, who knows?! Maybe in a few decades, maybe it will take 100 or 200 years or more! Point is, I am just trying to rationally explain to myself as to why, in spite of all the data that suggests that \textbf{racism} is still alive (and kicking harder than ever), we continue to¬†perpetrate it. Most of us think that we are not party to this (and we truly believe it in the deepest recesses of our hearts), but we are all covertly subscribing to a world view (most of the time unintentionally) by various actions of ours (or the lack thereof) which encourages \textbf{racism} or at the very least blatantly disregards it, because we are just not able to overcome it owing to the stage of the evolutionary process we are in as a species. We must continue the open dialogue which will help us accelerate our evolution¬†even while fully understanding and accepting that we are eons away from claiming to be a truly evolved subset of the primate order. Until then, unfortunately, this issue will persist :(\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Racism & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/332 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.904 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I know that vlogbrothers are all about complexity so allow me to add some complexity to the issue of \textbf{race} and the criminal justice system by linking to an excellent review of a huge breadth of the evidence.¬† [LINK] The TL;DR version is that the evidence of sentencing being biased against blacks based on \textbf{racism} (here in defined as the explicit or implicit belief on the part of individuals that there are inherent differences between races, I'll show why this definition is important later) seems rather solid. The evidence that \textbf{racism} in the previously defined manner impacts police work and arrest rates is much, much weaker. This does not mean \textbf{race} isn't important, but it does mean that for police work STRUCTURAL \textbf{racism} not ¬†the previously defined \textbf{racism} is the problem and that has major consequences for good policy making. Structural \textbf{racism} is \textbf{racism} that exists because color \textbf{blind} rules actually impact one \textbf{race} more than another. So for instance, the law may ban whites from using crack as much as it bans blacks, but if \textbf{black} usage rates are higher then there is structural \textbf{racism} in the system even if every police officer and every judge is completely non-\textbf{racist}. Arrest rate issues actually seem to come down to structural not non-structural \textbf{racism} because \textbf{black} live in poorer more crime-ridden neighborhoods because of the history of non-structural \textbf{racism} they faced.I think it's vital to keep the concepts of \textbf{racism} and structural \textbf{racism} separate because they have different solutions that are required. For non-structural \textbf{racism} the answer includes things like anti-discrimination laws, diversity training, and more exposing people to other races. For structural \textbf{racism} these methods are completely ineffective because no individual has to be \textbf{racist} for a \textbf{racist} outcome to occur. With structural \textbf{racism} you need things like changing laws that disproportionately disadvantage oppressed groups and wealth transfers to make up for previous oppression. When people hear "police are \textbf{racist}" they too often think the answer is hire more \textbf{black} police officers or increase diversity training. Or the police and their supporters get offended by being told how they feel about blacks when that does not match their internal experience. It's basically like telling a \textbf{black} person she doesn't really feel oppressed, and that she's faking it. Not to mention the evidence doesn't actually strongly indicate the traditional \textbf{racist} charge is right. Talk about structural \textbf{racism}, and no individual police officer need implicitly or explicitly hold \textbf{racist} views for the system to work poorly for blacks. The problem then becomes "how do we need to change our laws and welfare rules to counter-act historical oppression?" That's a very different question than "how do we get police officers to stop hating \textbf{black} people?"\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Blind, Race, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}29/453 & \cellcolor{green!5}6.402 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small PREFACE: I am not \textbf{racist}. Yes, I am white. Yes, I am privileged. Yes, I am American. Yes, I have hardly any \textbf{black} people at my school. No, I do not know many other \textbf{black} people. One time, I was in Over the Rhine in Cincinnati, Ohio because I was at the library. I was at a crosswalk with a lovely and happy looking \textbf{black} family with two little kids, and I felt a little uncomfortable. I didn't say anything rude or whatever, but it just felt \textbf{weird}. I felt out of place. And I was out of place. I was in a predominantly \textbf{black} area. Maybe I thought I might get mugged. I don't know. I'm not intentionally biased or stereotypical. Okay, enjoy my response. ****When I say 'we' I'm usually referring to the majority white corporate employers, the United States as a \textbf{nation}, or just the near 100 white community I live in.Lol,I agree that not hiring someone just because of their name is a bad reason for not hiring them. But really? Lakeesha? Google doesn't even recognize that as a word. It recognizes Jamal. It's just that they have ridiculous names. It just sounds \textbf{dumb} in our culture.But what about Asian names. I'm going to come up with a Japanese sounding name: Ikamoto. Doesn't that sound Japanese? Out of two people with the exact same resume, would you hire Ikamoto or Lakeesha? I would probably hire Ikamoto. It still sounds ridiculous to me, but I don't think it's a funny name. I wouldn't laugh if I heard this name in real life.I think (I am in no way making any statements, only speculation.) the reason for this bias is because Japan has more of aa presence in America. We are familiar with Japanese (and other Asian) sounding names, not because we are like Japanese people more than \textbf{black} people, but because we have less of a relationship and connection with \textbf{African} culture. I could not tell you an \textbf{African} sounding name. I honestly have no idea whether Lakeesha or Jamal are ¬†\textbf{African} sounding names. And despite lots of \textbf{black} people having bizarre sounding names, we still sorta shun them, because they are unfamiliar.Or maybe I'm wrong. Maybe all these employers are \textbf{racist}, and when they see a resume with a \textbf{black} sounding name, they just throw it out. If I were an employer, I would definitely be swayed if I saw a resume with a \textbf{black} sounding name, but I don't know if it is because of \textbf{race}. If I interviewed a white \textbf{woman} with the name Lakeesha, I would be swayed in the direction of a person with an identical resume with a normal sounding name.If I have offended anyone, I am not sorry.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The situation with feeling uncomfortable in a predominately \textbf{black} area is quite \textbf{common} and I would say isn't \textbf{racist}. Most everyone feels out of place when they are the only one or seemingly only one in a group of ppl that are "other" (Not eloquently put but can't think of another way to state it).¬† Its just that while the feeling never goes away us minorities become more accustomed to it because white ppl are the majority and most of us have contact with white ppl quite often whether it be at school, work, relationships etc.....As for all your opinions on names I'll just condense it down to this:"Or maybe I'm wrong. Maybe all these employers are \textbf{racist}, and when they see a resume with a \textbf{black} sounding name, they just throw it out.">>>I think this is where some ppl find it kind of hard to believe. Not every manager who looked at the resumes said "Well that person is \textbf{black} and I don't like \textbf{black} people therefore I'm not going to hire them" sometimes preconceived notions and bias are an unconscious thing that still negatively affects how minorities are viewed and treated.Also one other thing I liked to point out you stated:"Out of two people with the exact same resume, would you hire Ikamoto or Lakeesha?

You both find them funny sounding but you choose one over the other, why? Could it be that you hold preconceived notions about the people who hold these names? Only you can answer that.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Hey dustichux one more thing I would like to discuss is the difference between Africans and \textbf{African} Americans. When dealing with \textbf{race} relations in America while recent \textbf{immigrant} of Africa certainly can experience discrimination most of the examples and links are dealing with \textbf{African} Americans. An \textbf{African} American is just another name for an American who is \textbf{black}. I am an \textbf{African} American born and raised in America and so were my parents, grandparents etc.. up to a certain point. So while the US may have less interaction with \textbf{African} culture the same can not be said for Afr Amer culture, heck we are a part of the culture. So being "less familiar" wouldn't work when dealing with Afr Amer since we are Americans. Its sad to say but in some cases it really does just come down to what \textbf{race} you are take a look at these 2 links: [LINK]  [LINK] In the vid at 00:13- 00:25 John stated that a majority of white Americans don't believe in¬† \textbf{racism} to be as problematic or systemic as it really is and his vid as well as links provided are set to illustrate that it does exist. But this shouldn't get any of us down as the 1st step to solving a problem is acknowledging it and hopefully this has opened some ppl eyes.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small On the topic of names, I'd like to raise a question. What were the races of the employers? Because culturally, names that are familiar and easy to pronounce are more likely to get hired. \textbf{Black} culture in the United States is unique, and it's understandable (Although certainly not acceptable!) that this might occur. Perhaps there is a definite bias due to the disconnect of those who are in the position to decide such matters (Criminal justice and business) purely out of culture. I'm certain that there is injustice, but it's sticky and prevailing enough that it's perhaps not just \textbf{race}.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/100 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.0 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Will probably get flamed for this but here goes (long post alert!):There are major cultural differences that correlate fairly well with 'traditional indicia of \textbf{race}', and which are likely to be relevant to a sentencing judge or a prospective employer.¬† In the former case, for example, a judge is entirely rational in deciding to give a longer sentence to someone exhibiting more signs of thug/gang culture, and sadly that culture has captured many more blacks than it has whites.¬† Thus, simply aggregating the statistics will create a false picture of bias; it's not quite the fallacy of the third cause but it's similar.As for the resum√©s, a hiring manager generally has to go through so many of them that they are forced to use more-or-less arbitrary criteria to 'thin the herd' before reading them properly.¬† Maybe they think names are a proxy, not for \textbf{race}, but for the attitudes and values of the candidate's parents, which will have been major determining factors in the candidate's development.¬† Or maybe any other criterion would produce similar levels of bias against some group, and some settled on names as the least obnoxious.¬† (It could be a statistical artefact of the names chosen; I have heard claims that some employers will sort CVs alphabetically and stop when they've got enough good ones, in which case Brendan and Emily would be looked at before Jamal and Lakeisha!)¬† Oh, and let's not forget that employment law creates strong incentives not to hire minorities, because if they turn out to be unfit for the job they're much harder to fire than a straight white male.¬† The employer who, on those grounds, avoids hiring blacks, is not being \textbf{racist} - he's just being sensible.¬† The racists are the people who wrote the law and didn't think about the incentives they were setting up.Moreover, it is well-substantiated that the mean IQ of \textbf{black} Americans is about 85, i.e. one standard deviation lower than average, and the situation is similar with measures of self-control and time-preference.¬† (Let me forestall the inevitable howls of "IQ is meaningless/the tests are biased": no, IQ reliably measures Spearman's g, and the error does not appear to correlate with \textbf{race}.)¬† While this does not, of course, mean that any individual \textbf{black} person is unintelligent (and interpreting it as such would be \textbf{racism}), it does mean that "\textbf{black} people are worse off" is not (necessarily) evidence of systemic \textbf{racism}; the same results could, generally, be produced by systemic 'bias' in favour of intelligence.¬† (A good analogy is: if you pick your sports teams based entirely on performance - \textbf{race}-blind - you will find your sprint team is mostly \textbf{black} and your wrestlers are mostly white.¬† If that's evidence of "\textbf{racism}" then the word "\textbf{racism}" no longer has any meaning and we have no word with which to label and condemn real racists.)¬† So for example, maybe the US health system is such a convoluted mess of overlapping systems, poorly-conceived Federal programs and perverse incentives that ability to get good treatment depends not on your insurance status but on whether you're clever enough to play the system.¬† And maybe a defendant who exhibits high time-preference in court is likely to get a harsher sentence than one who behaves well and only speaks when it's his turn (this is entirely rational: time-preference is a predictor of criminal behaviour).¬† And maybe a drug user who lacks self-control is more of a danger to those around him and thus more likely to be arrested.¬† Judging individuals based on relevant individual characteristics (which is never \textbf{racist}; prejudice is the use of irrelevant characteristics) will in fact have a "disparate impact" whenever those characteristics exhibit statistical differences according to \textbf{race}, and that doesn't make it even slightly wrong to do so.To summarise: the truth about discrimination resists simplicity robustly enough that simply measuring outcomes and correlating with \textbf{race} does not yield evidence about whether systemic bias is present, especially given the existence of systemic differences between the populations being compared.¬† The view from outside, at least from this UKian, is that outside of a tiny fringe of neo-Nazis (you get them everywhere), it is only the hothouse atmosphere of academia that has even kept the topic of \textbf{racism} a live issue in the US ‚Äî well, that and the investment the political Left has in keeping the racial-grievance machine turning over and manufacturing outrages it can use for electoral advantage.¬† (I mean, come on: if there were real \textbf{racism} in the US, they wouldn't need to keep manufacturing these fake ones.¬† It almost seems like no month goes by these days without the US media canonising some \textbf{black} "victim" who then turns out to have largely architected his own demise.)A final note: the real solution to the subconscious-\textbf{racism}-in-job-interviews problem (if it exists) is to allow employers (and universities etc.) to administer psychometric tests (including IQ) to applicants; people are much less likely to (subconsciously) reason "\textbf{black} people are less intelligent on average so I shouldn't hire this guy" if they have the candidate's IQ score in front of them.¬† (From a Bayesian perspective, direct information about IQ 'screens off' the indirect information provided by \textbf{race}.)¬† Unfortunately that's currently frowned-upon on disparate-impact grounds; as so often, high-minded attempts at preventing \textbf{racism} end up promoting it (see also: Affirmative Action).\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Race, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}18/891 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.02 \\  \hline

Just as being a girl and being bisexual are parts of me as well. On your point about "what MLK wanted", every \textbf{Black} American is not Martin Luther King Jr. We don't all have to share his exact philosophy on every little thing. \textbf{Black} people are not a collective hive mind that has to share opinions on everything.

Your logic is flawed because it depends on the idea that everyone respects your thoughts on yourself and takes them into account just because they respect you that much. But maybe that's just what you've come to expect from other people being a white, straight, cisgender, man. Maybe you don't know what it's like not to be what most of the United States considers to be the default. I can't be totally sure.ÔªøIn the general response you left here for everyone you said a lot of things about starting the "white" versions of things because there are a lot of \textbf{black} versions of things (dating sites, TV channels, or whatever). And you need to understand that the world we function in is largely built in favor if white people. Our justice system, the films we see, the comic books we read, the police departments in many parts of the country, many dating sites (\textbf{black} women are often ignored or disrespected through them because our skin color isn't "attractive"), the TV you watch, everything. If \textbf{black} people, or any \textbf{race} that isn't white in fact, wants to carve out a little space for ourselves in a country that is run by and for white people, then that shouldn't be a problem.  There's a \textbf{black} history month because the rest of the year, public school teachers are teaching the history of anyone else possible.

If we integrate "This is how the Germans wrote about WWII, and here's how the Brits, Russians, and Americans wrote. Now let's compare and contrast. How are their perspecives different?

Those are the things that make us! Our family, friends, where we live, how or what we're taught, that's who we are. Yes, genetics play a role, but you can't know someones favorite quote because of their skin color. Our skin color doesn't define who we are as a human being. Our culture does some, our genetics do as well, even then we are ever changing people, and our culture can change without changing who we are.Where do I disagree? Many of your points seem to undermine the ever so evident color bias of our culture. And even worse, some of your points blame those who are being mistreated.

Also, \textbf{black} people need to be referred to as \textbf{black} people in terms of medicine because \textbf{black}/asian people do have some biological difference e.g. \textbf{black}/asian people who live in western countries are more likely to have a vitamin D deficiency. Also, when a witness is giving a report of a crime they may need to describe the person, when it comes to the description that person has to be comfortable enough to give an accurate description even if that includes mentioning the skin colour, referring to them as a 'white person' or a '\textbf{black} person' it is the same as saying someone has blue eyes or green eyes.

And It's not the Jews decision or choice for being Jewish (as a \textbf{race} not religion obviously) or the \textbf{Black} persons choice or decision for having \textbf{black} skin. Where we disagree is that I think NOT putting you differences in peoples faces WILL (somewhat) shield you from \textbf{racism}. I would say put what you have in \textbf{common} with all people forward as your identity. Yeah there are definitely unavoidable, obvious differences, but we don't have to throw our differences at others when we could try to put our commonality forward in it's place.It's the bully's fault for bullying, but if a nerd walks up to him with his lunch money in hand on the first day of school. He is most definitely going to get pummeled. It would be smarter for that nerd to plainly put his lunch money away even though it's not his fault. Then once the bully has seen that this nerd isn't so bad he can flaunt his lunch money all day, safely.In short (though I have said it many times, in many ways), put forth first commonality, and later you can celebrate differences. Don't flaunt your differences, yet don't be ashamed. Don't go around labeling yourself as different, but once you are friends people are more receptive to differences. This is how the world works.And it also comes down to: some people want to be treated different and some want to be treated the same.I am thankful that you put forth the logical counter argument.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The healthiest way for a white person in America to approach this subject is first to recognize whether one feels that they treat others differently based on skin color or \textbf{race}, regardless of reason. Most would say no, so then the next step is to recognize that just because you feel you don't didn't mean you absolutely don't, even if you have the best intentions. And even if you do treat everyone equally, you should finally recognize that not everyone is as unbiased as you. \textbf{Xenophobia} is a part of human nature, we relied on it for survival as recently as thousands of years ago, brains don't change that quickly. And unfortunately visual cues are perhaps the most important to our species, so skin color is going to be a discriminatory factor within the core of most people's beings. Even if we don't intend to alternate or discriminate, it is a primal urge to favor those we recognize as our "kin" when no other difference is observed. Recognizing \textbf{racism} shouldn't be a matter of guilt or hate or shaming, but enlightenment.

I'd be willing to bet many of the people who ignore the evidence about \textbf{racism} also ignore the evidence when it comes to things like climate change, evolution, and the big bang.I think there's another motivation as to why white Americans don't see \textbf{racism} as a problem. People at the top of the socio-economic ladder like to think they earned their spot and are entitled to what they have. That leads to the idea that those on the bottom also earned their spot by being lazy. If they admitted how much of a problem \textbf{racism} is their preconceived notion that those on the bottom may be there due to factors beyond their control. Thus their own position in society may not be due to their actions but due to luck. Seriously, how many of the 1 would admit in public, "Yeah, I got here because I was really [censored] lucky.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I think it's also worth looking at what's going into the future. I plan on approaching this strictly from an education point of view, because when John said that racial bias is not an arguable thing that definitely applies to the justice system in the US.With that said, we're seeing a major swing in who's being accepted into colleges, to the point where a lot of colleges are even accepting disproportionate amounts of minority applicants compared to what the American population is comprised of (although this is not a nationwide trend. Based off of what I've seen universities located in more left leaning areas as well as the south exemplify this, logically so for the south). It's definitely worth noting that this will (eventually) change things when it comes to economic status assuming this trend continues. \textbf{Nothing} is going to change overnight, and statistics we're seeing, although the current state is not necessarily meeting the criteria of what is seen as equal (which is a very subjective, so the criteria may have already been met by some, or will never be met by others), are indicative of change at least when you compare it to similar statistics of previous years.The only part I'm fearful of is that the balancing act between equality is a difficult one. "Everyone is equal but some are more equal than others" often comes to mind. Assuming trends continue, although they probably won't continue indefinitely, we could be seeing society turned on its head, creating a new cycle of inequality but reversed. This is simply a fear though, and there's no evidence to say that it's reasonable for it to be happening soon. But with some of the more militant activists, it's apparent that at least some people want that. But I don't judge the sentiment off of extremists, the same way the Civil Rights Movement is often judged based off MLK and not the \textbf{Black} Panthers or Malcolm X.¬†Tl;Dr Shit might not be "equal" but it's getting there. ¬†I just hope it never goes too far.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!27}2/344 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.581 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I would like to respectfully disagree.¬†I think that many of the things we take as \textbf{racism} are, in reality, socio-economic \textbf{classism}. The poorer classes in America have less access to education, less access to quality health-care, and are then discriminated against on the basis that they are unhealthy and uneducated. Now, it is true that African-Americans (let's broaden it to minorities in general) make up the poorer classes. We're talking about the same problems for more or less the same people but using different words to describe it. What's the difference? Who cares what label we put on it?It matters because the words that we use to describe something have power in their own right. As an author I think you will understand this more than anyone. When you say \textbf{racism} its accusatory. Someone is deeply to blame in \textbf{racism} for holding backwards views. But it doesn't scratch the surface of the problem at hand. In fact, I would say that it misses the issue entirely.¬†It's easy to look at the statistics and think \textbf{racism}. It is, after all, occurring to minorities in general. But I think that that is sort of a lazy explanation. It's lazy because \textbf{racism} is easy to fix. Just get people to stop being \textbf{racist}. \textbf{Racism} is a human problem, not a economic problem. But what we've been describing; what we've been talking about here IS and economic problem. It's something we can fix, but it won't be easy. It will be a lot harder. Solving poverty is a hell of a bigger challenge than solving stupid. Fixing capitalism, is a massive endeavor.¬†Finally, I take issue with your opinion that the voices of those affected are more important than the statistics. I'm not trying to detract from the importance of the affected, but rather to impress the dire importance of statistics. You know that \textbf{old} phrase :"There are lies, there are damned lies, and then there is statistics." That's complete bs. Statistics are the most important tool we have for determining the cold reality of the world we live in and the issues that afflict it. Data is vital to decision making. But they can be mishandled, they can be misread (as I, respectfully, think that you are misreading them), and they can be outright forged. I would amend the \textbf{old} saying, perhaps, to this: "There are lies, damned lies, and damned liars who lie with statistics".Happy New Year John.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Classism, Old, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - General, Social Class - General & \cellcolor{green!5}10/410 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.439 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I would say that you're partially correct and partially incorrect.\textbf{Racism} is clearly an actual problem. The statistics regarding the treatment of \textbf{black} people for near identical crimes are ridiculously significant. But there have been controlled studies done on all kinds of measures proving that \textbf{racism} is alive and well in the modern world. The evidence is staggering.However, that said, you're quite right that the economic issues should be put front and center. The economic issues feed and accentuate \textbf{race} issues in the way you describe. The reason \textbf{race} is still relevant is that it is historical \textbf{racism} that has led to \textbf{black} people being poorer than white people -- it's the root cause, historically, not the other way around. So when you know the full history of the current socioeconomic structure of the US, it is really hard to not talk about \textbf{racism}. One could argue that it would be intellectually dishonest to ignore \textbf{race} in that context.(I think of it kind of like carbon dioxide and temperature in climate change theory. Increased temperature causes increased CO2. Increased CO2 causes increased temperature. They're both very much nested together. You can figure out which is the driving force (or forcing) and which is the weaker feedback in a particular time period, but it's hard to mention one without the other. If you did, it would be a huge simplification.)All that said, as a democratic socialist, I can't help but feel a lot of the world's problems would be improved if we could deal with economic hardships. So I'm behind you on that.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Race, Racism & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}9/265 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.396 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I think that it's more harmful to the debate to focus solely on \textbf{race} than it would be to ignore it (though I'm not advocating that either). What I'm saying is, when we make it about \textbf{race} we make it an accusation. White people become \textbf{racist} simply for being white. It's a discussion that has a lot of vitriol and not a lot of place to go. It's also an exclusionary discussion. If you look at other comment threads on this video you'll certainly see people questioning where a white man gets off discussing \textbf{race}.¬†As I've stated before, I think that jumping to the \textbf{race} conclusion is pre-mature. I believe that all or most of the above can be caused from socio-economic standing rather than outright hate. Focusing on \textbf{race} ignores the problem. I mean, it's great for stirring up conversation and emotion. But that emotion is so often hatred. And hatred isn't going to move this thing along.¬†I could talk for hours about socialism and why I'm not necessarily a socialist anymore, but I won't bore you with that. Suffice it too say that I'm still very close to socialism but find that the cultural benefits of competition outweigh the detriment of disparity.Regardless, I will agree with you that the current alignment of \textbf{race} along class lines is a result of historical \textbf{racism}. You can't look at America's past and not come to that conclusion.¬†For my part, I believe that education will even things out. We need to work to make sure we have the best education system in the world and really make sure that no kid gets left behind. We need to educate our children at all costs and from a young \textbf{age} regardless of \textbf{race}, religion, or socio-economic standing.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Race, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}10/297 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.367 \\  \hline

INFORMATION THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOWHere are 11 ways federal government giveaways gave an economic head start to white people while excluding people of color.1. Free landWhite Revolutionary War veterans were given nine million acres of \textbf{Indian} land.2. Legalized squattingIn 1841, the U.S. government legalized squatting, allowing white settlers to take over Native American land.3. Military-enforced squattingThe U.S. Government helped enforce squatting by employing the U.S. Army out west to beat back Native Americans from land coveted by white settlers.4. More free landIn addition to conquering half of Mexico, the U.S. Government reclaimed Latino landowners' land for minor infractions such as missing paperwork or back taxes, and then sold it to Anglo settlers at a minor cost.5. Even more free landThe Homestead Act of 1862 provided free or very inexpensive land was provided by the government to 1.5 million white families.6. Revoked promises to slavesFollowing the Civil War, freed slaves were promised ‚Äò40 acres and a mule.' Following Lincoln's death, this promise was revoked and land was returned to its previous White owners.7. Preferential treatment of white workersThrough the New Deal, the U.S. Government provided minimum wages, union rights, and social security to industrial workers, almost all of whom were white. These same benefits, however, were denied to agricultural and domestic workers, most of whom were people of color.8. Government-sponsored aidGovernment-sponsored aid was provided to struggling white farmers while denying it to most \textbf{black} farmers from the 1930's right through the 1980s.9.

However, you go on to suggest that \textbf{racism} against \textbf{black} people that comes from assuming they're poor is not actually \textbf{racism}. That's utter bullshit. That's the primary form that \textbf{racism} took in the north after the civil war and is one of the primary excuses used by racists after the 1967 civil rights act in order to exclude people who it had just become illegal to discriminate against. That assumption is \textbf{old} and plays into \textbf{old} stereotypes of lazy \textbf{black} people. It is most definitely \textbf{racism}.¬†"\textbf{Racism} is a human problem, not a economic problem."Any problem can be called a human problem, including economic problems, is a human problem. For example, why don't Americans give large amounts of money to \textbf{African} families to enable them to fix their countries and why can't those stupid people build important things? Economies are run by humans, thus all economic problems ARE human problems. By taking this view you have taken solutions off the table that could help large numbers of \textbf{black} people for no good reason, and denied that there most definitely are systemic problems why \textbf{black} people have the problems they do.(from another comment, same author) "What I'm saying is, when we make it about \textbf{race} we make it an accusation. White people become \textbf{racist} simply for being white."And this is why it's so important to talk about \textbf{race} as a system. In the US, white has always been seen as a default, and efforts to include \textbf{black} people in media, going back even to the 2000's, always comes off as just meeting a quota. To be frank, we have a society that continually reinforces \textbf{racist} stereotypes in subtle ways. Another example, \textbf{black} people are more likely to be convicted of crimes, thus we understandably tend to think \textbf{black} people are more likely to be criminals and are logically then more worried around them.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Joseph Beck There is undeniably a very significant intersection between poor socioeconomic standing and the \textbf{African} American \textbf{race} in the US, and \textbf{classism} is a significant problem of its own. Nonetheless, there are issues that extend beyond the mere coinciding of low class with a \textbf{race}. Reasonably speaking, considering how prominent overt \textbf{racism} was not many generations ago, it's entirely unlikely that said \textbf{racism} has disappeared. Cultures change quite slowly, and 50 years is a very short time for a culture to entirely change its stance on anything. Moreover, issues such as longer sentences are unlikely to do with \textbf{classism}, as the most likely perpetrators of those crimes are people of low class (thus eliminating that factor in large part). Or take mainstream US media and how, for example, violence is portrayed there; the same acts, often by people of the same class, are interpreted very different. When the white man commits crime, the reasons are situational; the condition he was in, maybe \textbf{mental} illness, etc. When the \textbf{black} man commits the same crime, the reasons are dispositional; this "is just how \textbf{black} people are" (is pretty much what is said when you read between the lines).\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}African, Black, Classism, Mental, Race, Racism & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments, Social Class - General & \cellcolor{green!27}10/197 & \cellcolor{green!27}5.076 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small John you are absolutely free to say whatever you want, about whatever you want. Can I ask you a favor though? Could at least try and understand why the majority of Americans don't believe in systemic \textbf{racism} against minorities? On crash course, and this show as well, you and Hank always encourage us to view the world from all perspectives, not just what is commonly talked about in media.This opinion is parroted constantly by all kinds of media; Books, TV, music, movies, games, the list goes on and on. Yet the vast majority of people think it's an illusion at best or a fabrication at worst.You might think that numbers aren't helpful - that they don't tell the whole story. It might help if you didn't stop short too. Only including the opinions of white people seems both intentional and manipulative. As if inequality is already factual, and white people are all guilty until proven innocent.You actually touch on some of the issues at play here starting at 2:18 but you also completely ignore others - seemingly to construct a narrative. For example neglecting to mention that while \textbf{black} people make up about 13 of the population 45 of crimes are committed by \textbf{black} (yes this is inflated by repeat offenders, and yes white people also commit about 45 of crimes while clocking in at 70 of the population). This is far more crimes per capita than any other \textbf{ethnicity}, and I'm willing to be it's because of that point you made at 2:18. Which is odd considering inner city public schools receive more funding than other categories of public schools (before anybody jumps down my throat, inner city public schools are financed with less local tax revenues but also receive much higher state and federal funding, grants, scholarships, donations, and other subsidies resulting in more money over all (As a side note, this money has a higher tendency to be misappropriated and/or embezzled by school officials but more money is sent)).The study you mentioned is also under fire since it lacked many things that make it a valid and scientific study. First I feel I should clear something up, a panel of industry professionals was hand picked by the University to evaluate a series of applications - these applications where not being sent to actual companies. I'll remind you, these professionals were hand picked and often were not hiring managers. There also was no proper control to set base line behavior. Not all panelist were given the same applications so no consistency in decision making could be made. The applications used were determined to be 'equivalent' by the University, but were not identical save for the name (meaning similar schools, similar extra curricular activities, etcetera) (Similar does not mean same, there is an industry bias against hiring MIT graduates because they tend to be arrogant and bad at compromising and working in groups - this is an example of something a professor that has only been in academia their entire lives likely wouldn't be aware of. Then there is also room for bias against rival schools or Fraternities/Sororities that wasn't accounted for). There is also evidence of missing or incomplete data. Essentially, it is being accused being poorly cunducted or worse yet fabricating results entirely.When it comes right down to it, the uncomfortable truth is that these are correlations as you said. The problems that disproportionately effect the \textbf{black} community more than any other \textbf{ethnicity} hasn't been proven to have anything to do with their skin color. It is certainly easier to say that \textbf{black} people tend to live poorer, shorter, and less productive lives than their White, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, Native American, Jewish, or Arabian/Persian counterparts simply because of the color of their skin, but that sounds disturbingly similar to a line of reasoning I've heard somewhere else before.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The "problem" isn't with the sentiment of trying to end \textbf{racism}, but the lack of understanding how \textbf{racism} works and how we, as individuals and as societies, can surpass it and create more systematic equality for all. Every little thing we are, or do, affects how people judge us, from our skin color to our hair style, to our smile, to our words, to our gestures, to our opinions, etc.--and every one of these judgments lies within US. We cannot always stop ourselves from making pre-conceived misconceptions, for sure, and not even time will be able to cure us of that bias--our bias exists particularly because it's helped us survive as a \textbf{race}. HOWEVER, we can become more aware of our own biases and make our own decisions to stop such biases from how we end up treating others as much as we can. The issues run far too deep to completely stomp out in each one of us, but the more we know about ourselves and others, the more likely we'll be able to avoid conflict, create peace, and more than anything else, provide equality to our peers of every shape, size, color, \textbf{gender}, street, and kind.

Lucky something  that bad never happened to me. The worst I had was a hairdresser saying they wouldn't straighten my hair that it would be to much work and that they were a "European hairdresser". Which was odd since I asked the if I could make an appointment and they didn't do that but the guy said that I just needed to come. Also my hair looks more like what my Dutch father has instead the kinky hair my \textbf{African}/\textbf{Indian}/South-European mom has.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I don't understand how anyone can argue the presence of systemic rascism in this country.

While there have been improvements since the 1800s, we're still far from perfect and I think it's good that attention has been drawn to the issue lately, although I'd rather it happen under different circumstances. It's an unfortunate truth that rascism is still present in this country, but it's a truth that needs to be dealt with.

If it's something you believe in, you should speak your mind about it! For instance if you see some guy being a "\textbf{racist}" you shouldn't just cower, and think "should I say something? Or should I let it pass? What would be the consequences?" I mean granted there will be some cases where it might be best not to for some people... I'm not certain what these cases might be... But I do believe you should say something! And remember, while we are trying to get rid of "\textbf{racism}" you must ALWAYS! Remember this quote from, Christopher Dawson.  "As soon as men decide that all means are permitted to fight an evil, then there good becomes indistinguishable from the evil they set out to destroy. " Basically what I'm trying to say is... Fight evil when you see it... But there is a fine line of what you can do when you see it without becoming the evil you wish to destroy. I know I'm probably sounding like a hypocrite but... I'm not the best with my words... But I tried to make my point.

And yes, I know I'm ignorant on the matter, that's why I want to ask it: if a white person went to somewhere such as Dubai, where the amount of \textbf{black}/Asian/\textbf{ethnic} (I'm sorry, I don't really know the correct term) outweights the amount of white people, then do you reckon this sort of awful societal flaw/phenomenon is likely to reversed? I mean, whenever a video like this is released about \textbf{racism}, it is always about white on \textbf{black} \textbf{racism} in the western world, but surely other types of \textbf{racism} must exist... as horrid as it is.... right? Shouldn't we be made more aware of those issues, too, as I'm pretty confident I can't be the only person in the world who's education lacked anything about the eastern side of the globe and their state of affairs. I don't know, maybe I'm being over-sensitive, but whenever I watch a video like this it always makes me feel awful for being part of an \textbf{ethnic} majority.

But whenever i hear \textbf{black} \textbf{racism} groups, or just individual \textbf{black} people, talk about \textbf{racism} they don't use valid points like this at all, they'll use some \textbf{dumb} example to show that \textbf{racism} is a thing and it just hurts them. Those groups themselves are also \textbf{racist} many times too, they'll often deny \textbf{racism} against white people, they'll ignore facts if they might go against their points, and they often make is "Us vs them"(e.g. \textbf{black} vs white) and that hurts them a lot.So yeah if a group came out and said exactly what John just said they'd have my support, but the typical \textbf{black} rights group i will not support because they themselves are generally \textbf{racist}, ignore facts, and make it worse by making it about "us vs them" instead of us all just being the same.The \textbf{black} rights groups are generally like modern feminism groups, where it's more like extreme feminism and makes it women vs men instead of making us all equals.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Dumb, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}13/185 & \cellcolor{green!27}7.027 \\  \hline

True. but there is \textbf{racism} towards white people. it's not reverse. but the main one: "\textbf{racism} is being oppressed, physically injured..." or whatever. by that logic, insulting a \textbf{black} person because of their \textbf{race} IS NOT \textbf{RACISM}. Obviously, it is. So, therefore, insulting a white person based on \textbf{race} IS ALSO \textbf{RACISM}. Pick a definition, and let it stand FOR BOTH SIDES.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I'd like to jump in here and point out that there are two kinds of \textbf{racism}: institutional \textbf{racism} and individual \textbf{racism}. It seems like everyone arguing that "white people cannot be victims of \textbf{racism}" is talking about institutional rather than individual \textbf{racism}. Institutional \textbf{racism} is where the an entire system is set against you (take John's point about prison sentences being 20 longer for \textbf{black} people, for example) whilst individual \textbf{racism} is one person verbally, physically, emotionally, etc. attacking another person because of their skin colour, culture or religion.So you're partially right: white people do not suffer from institutional \textbf{racism}. However, anyone can be a victim of individual \textbf{racism}. My aunt (white \textbf{woman} in her late thirties at the time) was attacked six(ish) years ago by two young \textbf{black} men because they wanted "justice" (I'd call it "revenge") against white people. Being attacked on the street because of the colour of your skin? Individual \textbf{racism}. Doesn't matter what colour your skin is.The problem I have with your original comment, John Adams, is that this video is not about \textbf{racism} in general. John is specifically talking about \textbf{racism} against \textbf{black} people.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@projenna i'm not calling you \textbf{racist} and i will say there is truth in your statement,  but once again, your missing the point about the topic at hand!Every single \textbf{black} movie star, athlete, talk show host or person within the government make up less than 2 of the entire \textbf{black} population of 38,000,0000!You really want to know why whites have more money than blacks and this a fact coming from a white guy. 50,60,70,80 years ago when blacks wanted to be productive in society. Be \textbf{doctors}, lawyers, dentist, pro athletes,  movie stars etc, the whites of the early to mid 1900`s said hell no! Whites from around the time frame of around 1920 - 1960 didn't want blacks in their neighborhoods, in there schools, in their churches , working in their businesses etc. Whites could establish viable businesses that would grow and flourish,  while most blacks who had jobs could barely make ends meet.You say why? Well because a lot of whites didn't want blacks working for them,  and if they did, blacks pay was often at or below minimum wage because minimum wage wasn't enforced back then as it is today! Whites could get bank loans to start up a business,  buy land etc, whilst blacks of 50, 60,70,80 years ago couldn't even get a bank loan for such things. I won't even go into blacks being lynched almost daily around the US, or whites not wanting blacks in their schools, or blacks riding in the back of the bus only, not being able to vote, and so much more!Here's my main point and i hope you get this? It takes decades to build sustainable wealth . Sustainable wealth that you can pass on to your children, and children's children. Whites of 50,60,70,80 years ago were able to do just that, build wealth, build very successful businesses that flourished and are still around to this day! They left a legacy of wealth, to pass on to their children, and children's children that is very much alive and thriving today.Blacks of 50,60,70,80 years ago didn't fair so well, do to the fact that it was next to impossible for blacks to startup any kind of businesses that was profitable because they couldn't get bank loans, buy any kind real acreage,  at least not in the hundreds or thousands as their white counterparts could! I could go on, but what for?Conclusion! Because of the \textbf{racism} of 50,60,70,80 years ago, whites built a legacy of wealth that they could pass on to their children and children's children. Blacks of 50,60,70,80 year ago, because of prejudice and \textbf{racism} couldn't build a legacy of wealth to pass on to their children and children's children! Blacks instead had a legacy of poverty, structured ghettos and inequality to pass on to their children. So all the rich \textbf{black} movie stars,  athletes,  rappers and R\&B singers etc of today?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Jamie Cox you know that \textbf{old} saying that goes something like this. There's \textbf{nothing} new under the sun! I feel like i'm in a time machine and were fighting over the same thing we were fighting over back in the early to mid1900`s.There are 38,000,000 blacks, and no one will ever convince me that the 2 of blacks that are violent,  are worth treating the 98 that aren't violent like crap. I'm speaking more about a corrupt system that is corrupt from the top to the bottom.It targets minorities in ways that most whites can't even comprehend! It also treats the elite, rich, middle class and poor differently, and that in itself is a form of social and or economic discrimination. I will say this, that as a white person i see \textbf{racism} on both sides \textbf{black} and white.  But there is a tremendous difference for reasons for \textbf{racism}. White \textbf{racist} see blacks for the color of their skin and the negative attributes portrayed by the media and their personal experiences pertaining to blacks. Some whites see blacks as non responsible and not taking ownership of their wrongs in the \textbf{black} communities, whether it's murder, violence,  drugs, education, parenting etc. There is some truth to that, but the media blows that perception way out of proportion. A lot of whites eat it up and assume most or all blacks feel this way. Not true!Blacks that are \textbf{racist} typically draw their feelings from personal experiences and are not typically media based. And here's something that a lot of whites will find hard to believe,  but most blacks who have issues with whites, typically have issues with whites in positions of power and very rarely with whites in the general population .Blacks typically don't trust whites in absolute positions of authority, because it is whites in those very positions of power and authority that have abused blacks for centuries! Sad truth about it, is that there are statistics and data that shows that the same system that targeted blacks back then, is still doing it to this day!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Nothing, Old, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}8/350 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.286 \\  \hline

If those blacks get frisked and arrested then the police is doing its job because it caught a criminal.There seems to be a massive misunderstanding between us. Racial profiling obviously exist and I have been explaining you the whole time why it does. For example, if there was a theft and theres two suspects, one is white the other one is \textbf{black}. Simply based on statistics the police would be retarded not to check the \textbf{black} guy first since the chance that he did it is much higher. However if he's innocent then there is no problem.And again you don't seem to grasp the math behind rates and the relative amount of the population.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@good goy this argument is and was no longer about the 20 disparity as i already said that you were partially correct on that one. So I've moved beyond that one.I do understand variables and how they work and why they are important. But i also understand that variables are only consistent and accurate when those who are keeping track and are putting those numbers together in an fair and unbiased way!Dude I've been best friends with my cop friend for 35 plus years now, and he's been a cop for 24 years. I've seen this man in tears because of all the secrecy within the policing system. If cops make x amount of arrest in a week, but x amount of those arrest need to say aggravated assault and not attempted murder? Then they change their police report to fit whatever the numbers need to be.This happens a lot more than people realize, and this is nationwide! Police departments get a certain  of their annual income based on how many crimes such as murders, assaults,  drug bust etc. Of course their are no hard factual statistics to back up what im saying,  but it is happening all over this \textbf{nation} in most police departments. Police departments are investigated for these types of discrepancies, but typically little or \textbf{nothing} is done when discrepancies are found to substantiate anything other than a ? Mark on the police departments file of evidence reports.They are literally allowed to make up reports at times to fit what the departments statistical quotas need to be. This isn't coming from my knowledge, but from a cop of 24 years!I know you don't want to think this is going on nationwide, but it is and that is were we differ! You believe that all statistical facts coming from police are somehow biblical, without bias or a tainted purpose.I know that  wise the \textbf{black} youth are out of control!I know that  wise that \textbf{black} on \textbf{black} violence is on the rise!I know that  wise that if a white criminal and \textbf{black} criminal are approached by a cop, that chances are, the \textbf{black} criminal will more than likely arrested first based on the  that blacks are more violent!  I get it!But it still doesn't excuse the obvious profiling that's been taking place across this \textbf{nation} for years, which is part of the reason blacks have a higher arrest rate in the first place.  Even the prosecutors are practically on the side of police,  and thats why police are rarely found guilty of any crime, even when there's a mountain of evidence to suggest otherwise. The police and FBI agents are some of the few agencies within the system that literally polices itself. That's like my best friend doing something illegal, and i'm suppose to punish him without any bias? He's my best friend! Of course there will be bias!Dude, send your rebuttals, i get what your saying. But i see the other side of the equation, that you aren't looking at, because there's no statistical data to prove or disprove!According to a lot of white, there's still no statistical data to prove racial profiling! Even when cops are now saying, yes it does exist.I'm not trying to excuse the action of criminal activity on behalf of blacks no more than i am with whites.

I've now been called a \textbf{racist} by nkenge and now you, because i don't share all of your idiologies of white privilege and fallacy. You pick articles that tell partial truths as if their biblical and then try shoving them the throats of those, ie "whites" who don't agree with you or your articles .You continually use ad hominem and misandrist arguments against me for calling someone out on their racial rants against me, because i called her what she was calling me, "a \textbf{racist}"! Whites, blacks greens and yellows can be instruments of \textbf{racist} or racial benighted statements! And because some whites on these post are the true clear \textbf{racist}... using derogatory names and racial statements against blacks as a whole, but you would much rather verbally attack me with ad hominem arguments, because i called someone a \textbf{racist} who continually called me a \textbf{racist} plus a whole slew of other derogatory statements? I'm not trying to fight your battles for you, but when i see "white people" using racial hatemongering to spread what i would call ignorant \textbf{racist} rants... then i will speak out against that!Call me what you will, but i am not your enemy!  But nor will i just sit back and allow you to attack my character based on what your perception of "white people or white privilege " may be.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small With your statement, forgive my paraphrasing, "to deny systemic \textbf{racism} exists is to deny a lot of evidence," that's something people are really good at in all regards. Take for example, the anti-vaccine movements, or he'll just the anti-science movement. People believe something blindly and then deny all evidence to the contrary sometimes with an unprecedented fervour. And normally, when you say that, people agree it's not a good thing and leads to problems, like denying massive problems exist and therefore doing \textbf{nothing} about it. Until you say that's what faith is.Honestly, my personal belief (and I would love to be shown I'm wrong because I don't like it) is that people will deny systemic \textbf{racism} in America because they have faith that it isn't happening and that leads to a lack of solutions to the problem.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Nikky Jay I think you're completely right that¬†people, specifically Americans in this case, will deny¬†systematic \textbf{racism}. But¬†it probably isn't¬†due to the fact that we¬†hear a celebrity or a politician say it, but because we hear it said. See, many, many Americans simply do not want to¬†see that¬†our \textbf{nation} is screwed up in different ways. It is not because we¬†are a stubborn people, but because believe it¬†or not, some people pride themselves¬†in being¬†American. I know I do (at least in some historical aspects). But the problem is and always will be that people will not want to lose their pride in the process of saying "there is a serious problem", and as powerful people begin to say it, such as politicians, the public that entrusts their power into them takes their side because they already believe it themselves. I mean, there is a reason why these politicians are elected, because they represent the people voting for him/her. And to add to what \@Joe Betsill¬†said, they begin to quote politicians and say that it is fact. This is because we think so highly of politicians and (being the devil's advocate here) if they're smart enough to lead us, they're smart enough to state "facts".

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Nikky Jay¬†Our educational system teaches a false reality of what the state of the country is, especially \textbf{black} history month that only portrays a small fraction of the history and ends with Martin Luther King Jr, the studies that acts as if everything is over by that point and that acknowledgement of that history only calls for "a time of remembrance" and \textbf{nothing} more, that "everything is even now and that it won't happen again". Coupled with the \textbf{blind} unquestioned patriotism echoed within the system, few people are willing to acknowledge America being "less than" in any manner, take how often "America is the greatest country in the world" is parroted in media and by politicians... We've become utterly narcissistic feeding off an ego politicians and media inflates, hating when someone tells us otherwise because we loose that high given by our beliefs of being "the greatest". Were taught to unconsciously ignore the bad and instead only acknowledge the good when it comes to our opinions of America, this is further enforce by our lack of teaching of other systems from other countries that excel in fields we lack. Were purposely kept ignorant of our flaws in every medium, from schooling to television. If given a platform to speak out about the flaws, it must be within an acceptable context otherwise the media and politicians choice is to distance and attack that source with as much ferocity as can be mustered, take Martin Luther King Jr's final year when he spoke out against Vietnam and stated, a very true fact, that America is the greatest source of war and strife in the world, demonstrated through numerous records and studies of (I think) near a hundred American fueled uprisings and revolutions in the last hundred years, American backed dictators and war mongers, mass torture and killing of both criminals and civilians, invasions waged solely for oil, bombing of civilians, secrete wars, crippling of countries that won't fall inline with America's will (Cuba for 50 years for instance), ect... Most all of which is hidden from the educational system. We are taught to turn a \textbf{blind} eye to our flaws.I know I am greatly focusing on the educational system, there is in fact a lot more to it, but I feel it starts with children. What children are taught when they are young they grow up believing as adults, taught that \textbf{racism} is over and done with, that \textbf{racism} was slavery and segregation and \textbf{nothing} more, and changing this belief that people don't want to let go of is... well hard.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Blind, Nothing, Racism & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}7/431 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.624 \\  \hline

You create what is essentially the mother of all false equivalencies by insinuating that linking racial bias to issues faced by minorities in society is the same as saying that the Barbary pirates vanishing caused climate change. Not only is that a feeble attempt to discredit a huge body of statistical as well as empirical evidence, but it doesn't even make logical sense. The fact of the matter is simply that there are hundreds of examples of racial bias negatively impacting minorities and hundreds of years of undeniable \textbf{racism} in this \textbf{nation} and in others. There is only one point of very weak correlation between the barbary pirates and climate change. ¬†To say that the two are equivalent in terms of the correlation causation debate is intellectually disingenuous.¬†2. You assume that the barbary pirates vanished in a vacuum, uninfluenced by other factors. The truth of the matter is that the conditions which caused the barbary states to fall are directly related to climate change. If the western world hadn't industrialized, increased production, and developed new technologies then the pirates would have been around for much longer. The huge British navy, made possible by the industrial revolution, was essentially what led to the end of the \textbf{age} of piracy. In that knowledge, only a fool would suggest that the industrial revolution hasn't contributed significantly to climate change. So no, the fall of the barbary states probably didn't cause climate change, but the conditions in the world at that era in history definitely led to an increase in global temperatures.¬†3. If you insist on the argument that racial bias doesn't play a factor in the huge RACIAL disparities we see in so many areas then please tell me, what could be causing it? And no, cultural bias is not a viable alternative reason, they are intrinsically linked at the very, very least.

Up until 2-3 years ago you couldn't convince most whites that cops were racially profiling blacks. But after the new york stop and frisk laws stats came out. It was all too clear who was being targeted. Blacks and or minorities were stopped and frisked at a jaw dropping 87 minority to a 13 white ratio!

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Talk purely about the social aspects of \textbf{racism}, not the economic aspects. It is racial bias to suggest that changes should be made to raise \textbf{black} people to the upper class just because the majority are in the lower class. I understand that you did not do this in your video directly, but discussion about the economic results of \textbf{racism} are meaningless and only encourage more \textbf{racist} behavior via affirmative action programs that favor particular races. One could argue that it is to counter social \textbf{racism}, but in reality, there will always be social disputes among people, and trying to fix that one social issue by economic means is just hiding the problem and probably making it worse. Any such efforts should be made for all people in those situations, rather than due to \textbf{race} (such as to help the lower class, rather than to blacks). Of course \textbf{racism} exists on a social level, but don't talk about economic equality, just social equality. Even though the US was left in a heterogeneous state with more blacks in the lower class, that doesn't mean that \textbf{black} people are more entitled to resources to leave poverty, since \textbf{race} should be irrelevant. Anybody that isn't \textbf{racist} shouldn't feel that there is an issue with that, because whether you are born into one family or another doesn't make a difference, and it can only be unfortunate that somebody was born into poverty economically, not that they were born into a minority family. One thing that is an issue though is what happens in our social lives, which is where \textbf{racism} takes effect and has been causing issues, including the economic issues. So don't detract from the issue by discussing economic statistics, talk about how social disparity and stereotypes effect us, which is the real problem.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Ricochet Babalon¬†I'm Australian so I wouldn't know about the American education system but, from what I understand, what you've told me might also tie in with biases, prejudices, beliefs and faith, as does all education really. Those who believe there is no systemic \textbf{racism} in America might, as you've said, learn it through the education system and then confirmation and cognitive (and other) biases take over from there, and they (deniers of systemic \textbf{racism}) subconsciously look for facts or statements or evidence that confirm the beliefs the person already holds. That's fine, we all do that constantly, like all the time, some of us are just a bit more aware of it than others for various reasons.¬†You went on to mention that people get quite upset when they're shown or told that what they believe isn't true. From that one can infer that those who get upset about being shown this will often deny the evidence and that, I'm sorry, is what faith is. It is the "denial of observation so that belief can be preserved." The education system probably plays a big role (I'm definitely assuming here because I need to research it to have an opinion). But what I've gathered from the research I've already done is that all of these factors come into to play in the form of biases, prejudices and the denial of evidence that says those very established biases and prejudices are wrong (faith).\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Racism & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/242 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.826 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Hey John. I am actually an economist that studies discrimination. While I tend to specialize in \textbf{gender} discrimination, I will tell you about a \textbf{common} criticism of that Chicago paper you cited (and a little background to make it easier to digest). Ethnically "\textbf{black}" names are not only signals of \textbf{race} but also a signal of cultural background and class. It is unclear whether the discrimination observed in the Chicago study (or really most studies on the subject) is due to the sort of \textbf{racism} people traditionally think of. When most people talk about discrimination, they are thinking about "taste based" discrimination. These are discriminatory policies based on dislike of the group discriminated against.However, there is also the concept of statistical discrimination which I think is more complicated. If there is an overall pattern of \textbf{African} American applicants being less able than otherwise observably identical applicants, savvy employers with hire white employees even in cases where \textbf{African} American applicants are as qualified or slightly more qualified by obvious metrics. It is essentially an information problem: employers cannot directly observe the quality of an applicant so they use all possible information at hand to determine whether one applicant is better than another.This is not to imply that \textbf{African} Americans are in any way intrinsically "worse" than whites. Rather, it could have everything to do with these people's background. In this video, you mentioned that predominantly \textbf{African} American schools are less likely to carry certain classes. Even just from that, there would be a tendency for \textbf{African} American applicants to have a less well rounded educational background than their white counterparts even if both sorts of applicants performed equally well on their more rarefied collegiate courses. The influences of social groups and peer groups exacerbate this effect. White applicants are probably more likely to have better educated and better connected friends that both expose those individuals to new ideas but also act as an outside resource to call on in situations that fall outside the applicant's specializations.Even amongst \textbf{African} American applicants, "Shaniqua" is probably going¬† to have a harder time finding a job than "Alice" since the name "Shaniqua" is associated with a certain social group and background that may also be associated with lower levels of productivity.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African, Black, Common, Gender, Race, Racism & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}11/379 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.902 \\  \hline

Same as Florida to Maine. Arizona to Pennsylvania. Just how people talk varies from city to city.\textbf{Racism} won't ever not exist amongst people.

If a company has the bad luck of hiring people that have \textbf{nothing} in \textbf{common}, that have no shared interests to talk about, that can't relate to others in stuff like hobbies, weekend activities, music, sports, political views, science, what happens, is endless days where people spend most of the working day in silence, they go to work in the morning with no energy, because they perceive others to have crappy boring tastes.Before anyone gives this a bad interpretation, it's not that a white person and a \textbf{black} person can't share \textbf{common} interests, it's just that based on empirical trends and patterns, the probability of similar personality profiles, drops with different races, people from different races DON'T like the same things as often, it's just a fact. The employer cares about smooth relationships, he cares that if he needs to criticize someones mistakes, he will not be acused of being \textbf{racist}. Why bother to hire a problem? Why bother to hire someone that talks about \textbf{race} issues everyday?I thank¬†\@edentulate1¬†and¬†\@Drache222222¬†for their inputs too, they touch on a crucial point. "Just putting out statistics is NOT science". Science needs a structure of reasoning,¬†just saying that white people are \textbf{racist} because they treat others differently, is garbage. People don't hire because they feel genuinely unconfortable with the agressive LOUD CULTURE.There are thousands of videos with \textbf{crazy} fights where 30 - 40 \textbf{black} people go insane and these people live in houses that actually look nice. \textbf{Black} Culture is a PIECE OF GARGABE,¬†and that's what needs to change. The day when \textbf{black} violent crime is not 50 of total, but only 15 and when school performance is on par with others, NOT on a individual level but on a wide basis... there is the day when people can talk about "systematic" \textbf{racism}. If blacks continue to turn their schools into a circus, listen to rap and be violent, the good \textbf{black} people will continue to pay, that's how nature works. Human beings evolved to find patterns to make more efficient decisions. The efficient decision is to avoid hiring blacks BECAUSE making a person by person analysis is too costly. This is an pure investment concept. Cost/Risk vs Return.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small +vegaskidd¬†First, I agree with you for the most part. Educating everyone is not a bad thing. What is a bad thing is educating people who do not want or need to be educated. Most jobs require training on the job regardless of initial qualification level. There are jobs that need to be accomplished that do not require technical skill and for those positions, positions vital to the functioning of society as a whole, there is a need for people that are able to perform these individual tasks. They need no more ability than to perform this single task and therefor are not in need of a formal complete education. Assuming wages are based on how hard one works, the overall contribution to company profit margin, and the qualification of an individual, if their work load is equal to someone who does have a higher education it would stand to reason that wages should be equal. Quality of life, ideally, should be equal for all individuals that work hard enough to deserve it, regardless of any external factors. True equality is not about making people socially equal, it is about celebrating our differences while at the same time not allowing them to separate us, and allowing equal opportunity by granting everyone the best resources to increase their standard of living above others if, and only if, they have earned it. Its just as wrong to steal from the rich as it is to steal from the poor. Stealing is stealing. Don't grant people anything they haven't earned on any basis, no mater what that basis is, unless you personally feel like giving away your personal value, that they have, in no way, earned.The issue arises from the fact that the world is not ideal. We have issues that arise from the fact that there are more people on earth than there is value on earth to go around. So, we can either all have so little that we starve to death and the entire world is illiterate and poor, or allow the existence of classes based on the value that a person has created for themselves. Humans are not yet at the point where we can give everyone free life on a silver spoon. We are not yet out of the woods, and so long as we are reliant upon nature to sustain us, natural selection will place wherever there is competition. Life takes work and each individual is responsible for their own part of the puzzle that is a successful society. It's not the wealthy, the poor, or even the middle class that need consideration, its the value of what each individual has produced with their lives. That value is what earns a person the right to continue living. \textbf{Nothing} is free, especially life. If you want proof of this, imagine trying to live in modern times with no technology or society. That would take a ton of work. Without contributing to the world around you, you have effectively put yourself into this situation and have no right to expect anything in return. However, if we all do our part, no one will be left behind because there will be plenty to go around once we no longer depend on natural resources to sustain progress. People who generate little value and contribute \textbf{nothing} to society are often the first ones to complain that their free ride is being cut off. Reality check: there is no free ride. This is simply the process of natural selection weeding out bad eggs from an evolving sociopolitical infrastructure based on the value that an individual can produce. Even education can be accomplished without an institution. Don't believe me? Check out home schooling. Public education is simply a resource that streamlines¬†the process (well... sometimes), a benefit of contributing value to society. If your school is full of terrible educators and¬†you want education to be a part of your own personal contribution to the value of society, it is your own responsibility to get an education. It is one means of taking care of yourself, but not the only one. My point to leave you with is this: life is neither free, nor cheaply bought, but rather a struggle to survive the \textbf{transition} from slaves of human nature to masters of it.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nothing, Transition & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Sexual Identity - Transexuality & \cellcolor{green!5}3/720 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.417 \\  \hline

White people are usually listened to more which means we need to use that listening power to make others listen to those with less privilege\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Racism & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/56 & \cellcolor{green!5}5.357 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small isn't it \textbf{racist} to talk about only \textbf{black} and white people on \textbf{racism} video (I am not talking about only this video) and not including others like Asian and Europeans?\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/30 & \cellcolor{green!27}10.0 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small It's \textbf{racist} of you to think white people cant be named Lakisha or Jamal.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small When I lived and worked in Asia, \textbf{racism} got even more interesting. Over in that country (which I won't name), many people didn't think highly of their neighboring countries, and saw white people as \textbf{sexual} deviants who want to steal their women and smuggle in drugs. I'm an Asian Canadian (but not of that particular country), so I was looked at with even more suspicion even though I didn't break any laws or do anything shady. It got to the point where a co-worker tried to "prove" that my academic credentials were forged ‚Äì this could lead to criminal charges, possible jail time, and deportation. Obviously it didn't work, but to be targeted like that was disturbing and really shows that unfortunately, \textbf{racism} exists everywhere ‚Äì just in different forms. (And since then, I've become a paraplegic, which has introduced me to another type of discrimination known as "\textbf{ableism}."

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small this was an awesome video and was very articulate, which I expected \textbf{nothing} less from you. But anyway, thank you so much, John.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small On the first part of this video, RE the criminal justice stuff, I'll agree minorities have it worse, but the whole system is borked. Our incarceration rate as a \textbf{nation} is huge, and we literally have corporations controlling prisons and entering into contracts with states that mandate those prisons must be kept full to a particular level.This might be a bit cynical, but I think it might be easier and as effective to sell a general reform of the criminal justice system that just happens to deal the racial inequalities, than it would be to sell a direct effort to remove \textbf{racism} from the system while leaving it otherwise untouched.We have to accept that people, even people who are not \textbf{racist}, tend to look out for their own interests first. Where at all possible, efforts to make life better for the underprivileged should be branded and presented as efforts to make life better for everyone.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nation, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/157 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.911 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small John, you are awesome, but fighting \textbf{racism} is pointless.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Jahmar Fearon¬†We're not trying to change Bill O'Reilly's mind.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Fighting \textbf{Racism} is pointless? What a self defeating response that just rot the paragraph. Stay willful because when we're removing the spell of \textbf{racism} off of people you damn sure can't be discouraged. And negative language to speak about a negative mindset is not the medicine. WILLFUL, speak power and life into the change we want and need to see. Get tired of \textbf{black} people representing inferiority or even begging to get the attention of white people to fix it. No, WE be the answer. Civilized white people who are beautifully on this thread have to campaign to be the answer. TOGETHER. But absolutely no defeatist ideas which produce defeated living, which shapes defeat altogether.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Jahmar Fearon¬†I think you are correct in your second statement: it is probably true that some amount of prejudice is ingrained into human nature. However, you yourself point out that "there are ways of combating prejudice without ending it." Unless you think that \textbf{racism} is not a form of prejudice, then that statement seems like it directly contradicts your first claim that "fighting \textbf{racism} is pointless."It might be the case that some amount of \textbf{racism} is genetically programmed into our genes*. After all, we do live in organized societies, and before there were countries, humans lived in small tribes and mostly produced offspring only from within that gene pool. It makes sense that we would have an automatic function that differentiates a "them" from an "us". If skin color or other physical traits give those markers, then you get \textbf{racism}. To give an analogy: who would you be more likely to hire for a job? Your best friend, or a tree? Obviously, your automatic response will be to pick the organism that you know best and whose characteristics you are most comfortable with. Now, how about this: would you rather hire a tree for a job, or a human? Again, you will probably pick the human at first glance. It doesn't matter anymore whether the human is an individual known to you. In fact, it could be that you made the wrong call. What if the job was environmental cleanup, and the human candidate was a three-year-old kid? You would probably be better off with the tree. I do not mean in any way to literally compare humans of any sort to trees, but simply to illustrate how people are often more comfortable with and more trusting of groups of people who are more similar to them.Just because \textbf{racism} may be a natural instinct to some extent, that does not mean it cannot be overcome and it certainly does not mean that it should not. By educating ourselves and accepting that \textbf{racism} is very much present in this country, we can be on the lookout for biases in our own thinking. If we can recognize some of those automatic responses and think them over, we can use the rational parts of our mind to help make an unbiased judgement or choice. It is very easy to say that "ignorance is a choice" and prejudice "can't be helped", but it is a problem that can improve with effort and education. Maybe we will never have a country where \textbf{nobody} is ever \textbf{racist}, but even changing one person's prejudiced views is a step in the right direction. Maybe vlogbrothers won't reach the same number of viewers as Bill O'Reilly, but every person who watches this video has already taken a step to broaden their knowledge about \textbf{racism}. We have the power to continue reducing our own prejudice by catching those times when we are accidentally biased and using our rational minds to think things through. There is no reason why Brendan should be a better employee than Jamal if they have the exact same resum√©. Our automatic, intuitive thinking may not see this, but we can detect the error very easily if we take the trouble to put in a little \textbf{mental} effort.Fighting \textbf{racism} is not pointless. Prejudice may be human nature, but there are ways of combating prejudice without ending it. We shall overcome someday.*(I have no actual evidence for this statement at the current time, but I will try to use logic based on things I DO know for certain to make my point.)\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Mental, Nobody, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}11/599 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.836 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Great video John! I was thinking about this topic just this morning. Now bare with me, all that I am going to say isn't trying to deny that there's \textbf{racism} in the USA, but I am Italian so I'm going to talk from my perspective. I've never been to America, but from what I can see through media and film and whatever, \textbf{African} American people are fully integrated in society. And that's right, since you've been cohabiting the same land for centuries.Here in Italy, \textbf{racism} is everywhere and we never address it seriously. Of course we youger generation are taught about it, but when it comes to actual life it's a whole other story. I've known people proudly calling themselves \textbf{racist}, believe it or not.For example, I've never seen a \textbf{black} waiter, a \textbf{black} bartender, a \textbf{black} driver, let alone non-white teachers or \textbf{doctors}. You only see non-white people working in their neighbourhood shops (like muslim butchers, for example), or in buildings or little shops in big cities wher they sell fake merch. I've never even seen a non-white cashier now that I think about it.It's really a COLOUR thing, though, because a white \textbf{immigrant}, like an Ukranian or a Romanian, has double the chances to get a job than a Moroccan or Bengali (or Chinese!) \textbf{immigrant}.Do you see where I'm going? Some (Italian) people say that the government shouldn't think about "foreigners" until they're able to take good care of their citizens, and that's kinda true, but not all "foreigners" are clandestine, and in fact most of them have the citizenship. That's why I feel like saying that, despite the racial inequality still existing, you are really, "progressed", in lack of a better term. This post was really rushed but I hope I got my point across!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African, Black, Immigrant, Racism, Racist, doctors & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}10/302 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.311 \\  \hline

How long would you wait? \textbf{Racism} is "grey-er" than it used to be, but it is a bit irrelevant to wonder about if the US has the pole position in an international \textbf{racism} \textbf{race} or not.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small im sorry people, this is just a video and every other \textbf{racism} video these days doesnt really hit anything, for one thing \textbf{racism} IS NOT A PROBLEM, its a genetic application our ansestors have been doing for millions of years, and we dont do it just with \textbf{race}, we do it with objects too, biases make your life easier, and more efficient, when you sit in your chair you dont try to take it at face value, you dont check if its falling apart or anything, you JUST SIT IN IT because your assuming through a bias that it will support your weight.So if people being \textbf{racist} isnt the problem, is our cultural biases derived from genetic associations the problem? No, the real problem is the constant promotion and identification of \textbf{race}, for example when people say "blacks go through this and whites go through this" every single time you promote a color or a \textbf{race} you are identifying it, that is the problem. SO if you dont like \textbf{racism}, the best thing to do is shut up about it. Your turning me into a \textbf{racist} because I got to ignore it my whole life, I dealt with blacks, whites, yellows, every fucking color of person my whole life, and I treated them like a human, and like a brother, but now people want to identify them as different, or as special, and simple fact is, thats whats causing the problem\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Race, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}8/242 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.306 \\  \hline

First off, our countries government is not capable of hiding something that massive from the masses it's never happened before to any civilization is the history of the world without the public being fully aware but the difference is they were being controlled. Accusing the government of doing that is in my eyes illogical without physical evidence (send me the picture because i'm looking for it) also even though what you have claimed (the CIA did this) Many times before rogue agents would break the law to make money abusing their power that is no secret but i still need physical proof the government does this at a systematic level were drugs are annually pumped through these low income neighborhoods. let's say they are it's still the users fault in my opinion, make drugs legal so all the \textbf{dumb} people kill themselves by overdosing that is how i see it. I'm a different breed of animal though, i'm a realest and when i see a problem i always search for the permanent fix the funny thing is so are the drug users. I know multiple people who grew up in low income neighborhood's in st Louis Missouri and i asked them how they got out of the hood and they said because they worked, both parents were in the house hold, and the parents were very involved in the child activities, preventing him from becoming a hoodlum.

I have been treated as white till I speak Spanish then people of color will change how they speak to me. So its a little strange some times to look like me. The interesting part is I am a brown statistic when it comes to education, health care, and criminal justice.When it comes to health care, education, and criminal justice, there is a definite separation of available doors that are provided by the "system". The key difference I see between white people and other races is the fact that people of color have to work harder because we don't have the established connections or roots in this country we must start from scratch. The great thing about America is that we have the option and right to work as hard as we desire to reach the goals we desire. Most Americans have not been to countries like mexico, Nicaragua, El Salvador, or really asked the people of those countries the situation that made them decide to leave. Life in these countries is very tough so to come to a new country and start from \textbf{zero} is a feat on its own, now add the issues of avoiding immigration when your at work, driving to get work fearing being profiled, or just walking to the store and being asked for your documents, this is real stuff but white people or \textbf{African} American people will not understand it because they are seen as Americans. I truly believe that this \textbf{race} craze has come to light because of things like ferguson and school shootings whom have been by white males, I think its a positive matter that these statistics came light and will shed concrete data for people who don't understand that racial tension is real on either end of the spectrum, I just think is very interesting that Asians don't tend to come up much in these conversations, it's always white, \textbf{black}, and brown but that's a different conversation.Thank you for the well balanced video.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Benjamin Abruzzo‚Äã how do progressives cause \textbf{black} poverty? I don't know if you've studied American economics but one of the root causes of poverty is neo-libralism (known more as libritarianism in the US). Not providing the correct social welfare and safety nets for the poor is a significant problem in \textbf{black} American poverty. As for the "breakdown of the family" this wouldn't have the same kind of negative affects on single mothers and their children if there was a comprehensive system in place to help them with important costs to make sure the children could go to school and that the mother (or father) is able to be there to support them instead of working multiple full time jobs. People say "the breakdown of the family" like it's this scary horrible thing. But in reality if two parents have a miserable (and possibly abusive) marriage,  that's not really much better. I don't really think you should always stick by your partner no matter what, especially if the situation had become abusive. The problem with blaming \textbf{black} culture or people wanting to keep their "blackness", as the commenter I was responding to so elegantly put it, is that it pretends that all of the poverty \textbf{black} Americans face is because  of divorce rates,  or single mother rates or "cultural laziness" when in reality \textbf{black} poverty is prevalent because for the majority of American history \textbf{African} Americans were either enslaved or had little to no political or economic freedom.

Statistic show there are about 250 officers per ever 1000 people, which sound like a lot on duty, until you remove clerks and detectives, then divide by three for each shift, then remove those who are in court at any given time (about 25) and you have about 20 or so on patrol protecting ever 1000 people.

Still, I think the persistence is being less due to actual \textbf{racism} and is due to the same phenomenon as "Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me."Other traditions and beliefs persist in a culture that once had meaning, but no longer do. Why did the 1970s housewife cut the end off the rump roast before cooking it. She was taught to do that by seeing her grandmother do it. But her grandmother was from the 1930s and she cut the ends off because the pan was too small.That was generally the entire point of this thread, from my post on. It isn't \textbf{racism} because people don't connect the actions to \textbf{race} any more, they connect it to what they see and their brain, a miracle in many ways, does what it did when we were still proto-humans, animals in many ways, it fills in the blanks from what we see, hear, and smell, with what we know happened before. What was the great thing about humans that helped us survive and evolve is now what holds us back in many ways.Maybe some would call what I'm saying "institutionalized \textbf{racism}", but I think \textbf{racism} has to be an active choice and it has to be proved before somebody gets the label. Using the label for every action a person doesn't like demeans the real acts \textbf{racism}, making more people \textbf{deaf} to them. Basically, rather than shouting louder and not being able to hear others over the din, we should all quiet down and listen with open minds.But, as you can attest, even when listening, hoping for the truth to become clear, you will get attacked bu people who want to yell because they believe so much, they can't communicate their position without making people close off.Look back at this thread and tell me I'm wrong about that. Who is the person who admits when he is wrong, talks with those who are civil and willing to share, and only name calls and yells when being attacked for the sake of the attack and the passion of the opposing belief?Not trying for pity here. I'm just saying.I am about to begin making videos on politics and society and I know I'll be making mistakes along the way. I'll be looking at TV shows and their messages and will probably be looking to The Wire for some of the reviews. I hear it highlights the issues very well. I have found that out of all the current shows that use politics as a plot, few try to explore and most exploit the topics. One show I found is good for what can be done in Hollywood on network TV is Blue Bloods, as it tries to explore the many opinions, including the generational \textbf{racism}, the conservative side and the liberal side and even the \textbf{black} side vs the white side. It's not perfect, as few shows can grasp a complicated issue in 45 minutes, but it is more of a conversation than I've ever seen in real life.I doubt we will see the solutions in our lifetime (or at least mine), but we can only get there on calm waters, as the chop and the storm will only capsize us.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Deaf, Race, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}11/569 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.933 \\  \hline

I find it ridiculous that people discriminate others because of the amount of melanin being produced by our melanocytes. That's all it is really. Just wanted to address something that I saw if a few comments- \textbf{racism} towards white people does exist. In the US as well. Just because we don't talk about it doesn't mean it's not there. I believe \textbf{racism} comes from experience and socialization. It could come from your parents or your day to day life. A memory that I cherish- is my preschool and kindergarten days. Both years, I was the only white girl in the class. (With only \textbf{black} classmates and teachers) At a young \textbf{age}, no \textbf{racism} even existed or was even THOUGHT of. The first day, I was hugely welcomed and played with everyone. Wouldn't be able to recall any bad memories from the teachers. My brother, then in first grade, wasn't so lucky. He was victimized by the teacher and classmates for being white. My parents as well, have experienced it first hand. Not getting help for being white, or racial/sexist slurs towards my mother. During high school, I heard hundreds of things that were \textbf{racist} towards white people, that are so \textbf{common} that they don't even realize what they're saying. I'm not trying to downplay \textbf{racism} that's happening in the US today, just a reminder that fighting \textbf{racism} by \textbf{racism} isn't the way to go. \textbf{Race} is just a word, we're all human after all. :)\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Black, Common, Race, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}11/260 & \cellcolor{green!27}4.231 \\  \hline

Cultural stereotypes have real effects on people, but they're harder to measure than things like wealth or prison sentences. Where can I find data on these effects?None of this is to detract from this video, which addresses some very fascinating and enraging issues about \textbf{racism} against \textbf{black} Americans.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Of course there is racial bias. Of course there is \textbf{racism}. Why? Why do people treat \textbf{black} people differently? Why aren't Asians treated the same way? Why aren't Asians ever discussed when it comes to "\textbf{racism}"? It's because they, magically, are immune to racial bias, I guess. It seems that the melanin content in \textbf{African} skin sets off some sort of irrational rage gene in people. Isn't that just awful? Of course, we could consider that, perhaps, people are responsible for teaching others how to treat them. And/Or we could just look up the FBI's statistics on crime and compare the \textbf{race} population percentages to the percentages of races that commit crime. ...Let's see... As it turns out, there are about 5x more white people in the US than \textbf{black} people.That would mean in order for the general public to have an equal perception of \textbf{black} people to white people, when it comes to violence and crime, \textbf{black} people would need to commit 5x less crime than white people. If this is not the case, \textbf{black} people disproportionately are responsible for violence and crimes when compared to white people. Given that they are an easily identifiable minority, it should be no wonder why there are negative stereotypes, and why they are treated differently by the general, poorly educated public. SO, what is the solution? Well, if it's the melanin theory, which I'm sure is more pc, they are up the creek. If however, modern "\textbf{racism}" is a result of actions taken by people within the \textbf{black} community, it seems that the only feasible solution for ridding the country of "\textbf{racism}" (a reaction) would be to fix the problems within the \textbf{black} community first.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African, Black, Race, Racism & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}13/283 & \cellcolor{green!5}4.594 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Firstly, like I said, the callback for an interview thing isn't systematic. One or two people who decide who gets hired decided on the "white names" over the "\textbf{black} names", not even all the time, only sometimes, possibly randomly. There is no law against what they did, and they therefore can't be prosecuted. As someone who previously worked in hiring, my boss told me if two people come in with similar resumes, then I HAD to give it to the person of color, no exceptions. That hardly seems fair.Secondly, \textbf{black} people are getting longer sentences just 20 of the time, for similar crimes, not identical. There are details that are always going to be overlooked in those studies, usually in the favor of whoever is writing it. Not saying it doesn't happen, but you can't judge a national problem by a headline from CNN, you have to go deeper into the problem itself and judge every issue case by case.Lastly, saying \textbf{black} people are getting systematically killed is just wrong. For every study you can come up with, I could find two others that go against it.

Similar crimes are all that can be considered, there won't be two crimes that are identical. A trend is a trend. You're seriously going to stand there and tell me that all of these cases can be explained away by details. Doesn't it seem odd to you that in all the cases involving white people there just happen to be these minute details that override things, where as in \textbf{black} cases there arn't.3. No one said white names get chosen over \textbf{black} all the time. But a study involving litterally thousands of resumes showed that there was a trend. People with names commonly found among \textbf{black} communities are getting less call backs.

If you can find a completely factual, unbiased, proven true study or statistic proving your point, I'd love to see it.2. Details mean everything. The national justice system cannot go into detail for every crime in every state every time something happens. That's why it's the state's responsibility. And yes, I know no two crimes are really identical, I just think it's unfair so many people are comparing apples to oranges in so many cases. Also, a link to the FBI site explaining that a) \textbf{black} people commit more homicides than whites overall and b) that \textbf{black} people kill \textbf{black} people 10 times more than white people do: [LINK] 3. That fact that it happens that "\textbf{black}" names get called back less than "white" names (even if only by a small amount) is not evidence of \textbf{racism}, because there is no relation between \textbf{racism} and the trend. You can't say "Well \textbf{black} names are chosen a bit less than white names, so the people who hired them are \textbf{racist}!" You have to explain the relation between your source and your thesis. There is no proof to say they are \textbf{racist}, and no proof to say they aren't.

Again, by relying on details what you are essentially saying is that in 20 extra of \textbf{black} cases there are details that mean that \textbf{black} people should be more harshly punished. Do you not see how that streaches the bounds of credibilty? Also, the fact that \textbf{black} people commit more homicides isn't relevant. It is \textbf{racism} to judge an individual's potential actions by the actions of those with the same \textbf{race} as him/her.3. The reason it's not a coincidence is the number of samples involved. The source involved literally thousands of resumes. If it was just one or two, then yes, there could be coincidnece. But the study avoided that possibility by invoking thousands of resumes to thousands of different employers. The proof that they are \textbf{racist} is in their actions.

I grew up with more "Hunter"s and "Tanner"s than I can count (in southern Ohio), and for me that never really seemed like a name with meaning or effort behind it. Names are paramount in first impressions and in that case I would much rather hire someone named jamaal than someone named hunter. Titles are part of an identity, and parents shouldn't taint a child's life by making it laughable. For example some Dutch names sound like cuss words in English.

Yes, judging people on one aspect isn't the ideal but it's what happens anyway, perhaps without even being aware that they're doing it. You can't expect everyone to accommodate /creative parents by being more educated about names; trolls will be mean and tease inevitably.Do you think some names are objectively, universally better than others, either by just the way it sounds or its context/meaning? IMO Robert sounds better than Bob, Jacqueline better than Jane, etc. In fact most artists and other entrepreneurs craft their names or brands to be more artistic, memorable and representative of their particular passion. Their names are specifically meant to stick in people's minds, like an insidious pop song or commercial jingle. Anyway, I'm just saying that judging a name and judging a \textbf{race} aren't always an overlapping prejudice, and there's probably a lot more to it that we haven't discovered yet.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/178 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.562 \\  \hline

We have people dying because 'omg, fetus is still alive, sorry' while the pregnant person is literally being killed by the fetus. In case you're wondering, if you people manage to strip that right, it's a very slippery and quick \textbf{slope} down to forced organ transplants, blood donation, owning bodies, etc. 3)People tell those with pro-life views who do not have uteri to stay out of it because these people DO NOT LISTEN to the people who can get pregnant and do not care about the people they are putting in jeopardy. Also, fun fact. The pro-life movement started as a response to increased availability of the pill and abortion only became a cultural issue because upper-class white women started having fewer children.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I looked up the literal definition of the word '\textbf{Racism}' and not once did I see the word hatred there. I'm not trying to act like \textbf{racism} doesn't exist because it does, and it does on all sides, but if people looked at what it actually means instead of thinking that "all white people hate all \textbf{black} people" then there would be significantly less racial tension on a day to day basis in society. But what do I know? I'm a straight, white, Catholic, 17 year \textbf{old} girl that comes from a good family and goes to a good school. What do I know about discrimination? I do know this; In class, a white teacher  told a \textbf{black} student to take out their head phones and stop talking back. The student accused the teacher of being a \textbf{racist} and told her 'I'm not your slave' but, did not get in trouble. Is it the fear of being accused as being \textbf{racist} that prevented the teacher from pursuing the student further? If it were the other way around, I would have been in the principal's office being accused of being a \textbf{racist} white student. As a white person, I've had to over compensate in order to 'right the wrongs' of other white people. If we are picking groups in school, I can't deny people a role in our group, even if they're a bad student because some how my denial will turn into something racial. Things like "is it because I'm \textbf{black}/Mexican/Asian?" are thrown around like they're hello's. That shouldn't be the case. Some people need to stop using \textbf{race} as the explanation for their failures or successes. Sometimes, things just happen, whether in your favor or not, but it can't always be about \textbf{race} or hatred. \textbf{Racism} isn't a hatred thing, because not all white people nor do all \textbf{black} people hate all other \textbf{black} or white people. It needs to stop being portrayed as such a simple, two sided argument. It's so much more than that. Look at what you're trying to do, where you live, and who you're surrounded by.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Sebastian Crawford So \textbf{race} is a human creation, in that it is a social concept. We know this because there is no scientific basis for \textbf{race}. Like, is \textbf{race} dependent on skin color? No, because blackness, for example, ranges many skin-colors. Location? No, because Asians literally come from an entire continent. Like, it's a continent. North American isn't a \textbf{race}. Why? Because the people who live on that continent are too varied to be grouped together in that way. Japanese people and Indians are likewise very varied, but they are both considered Asian. Why? Because it's not based in anything but cultural perception.Culture is made by us. I hope you don't dispute this. If you don't agree with this, this conversation is mute.So \textbf{race} was created by humans. We argue about why, but I don't feel like it. IT was then utilize to create a hierarchical system that allowed them to justify the dehumanization of an entire group of people in order to exploit them for slave labor. This process, the one that allowed "Christians" to kill Native Americans and enslave Africans, this method of dehumanization, is \textbf{racism}.So yes, statistics REFLECT \textbf{racism}. But \textbf{racism} is a creation, a violent and disgusting and INTENTIONAL one. It's important to remember this so we can understand that it can be deconstructed and abolished.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small For people commenting/attempting to negate the presence of \textbf{racism} in our education systems:1. Realize that your story is incredibly important, but not always representative of the whole. I am a \textbf{black} kid who was part of the IB program and took Algebra in Middle School too, but that means absolutely \textbf{nothing} in context of how overall the educational system is \textbf{racist}. Nerdfighteria is sure to have an abnormal amount of AP and IB students. We are nowhere near equipped to be an accurate sample size of what minority student's have access to in terms of educational resources.2. Most areas are incredibly racially segregated due to white flight. When integration happened, white people literally ran away. Suburbs? In part, created to escape the integration of cities. Leading to those cities being stripped of resources, including good schools. Leading to many people of color who live in majority people of color neighborhoods and attending public school not having access to NEARLY the amount of resources as their white counterparts. Which is all a result of \textbf{racism}. Furthermore, the attempt to integrate by moving \textbf{black} kids to white schools rather than getting white kids to attend \textbf{black} schools and giving those schools the resources the white schools were already getting, was a horrible decision that resulted in schools that were already doing good for \textbf{black} people and other people of color to continue to not be funded properly. So when we say that majority brown (specifically \textbf{black} and hispanic) schools are underfunded and denied resources, be aware of the history and be aware that just because you did not encounter it, does not mean that it is not happening.Just saying.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Nothing, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}9/280 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.214 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small You're right, at least regarding the older generations in today's society. In London, this can be clearly seen in the various neighbourhoods formed of clumps of minorities (Wembley/Harrow is very \textbf{Indian}, Golders Green has lots of Jews etc.). I think this is because when people migrate, they have a strong feeling that sticking to their own is safer. I've recently become engaged to a person of a different \textbf{race} and have come across negative/surprised gut reactions from both sides of the fence.I'd like to think that more people of my own generation are not like that, but speaking as a non-white person in the UK, I think it can be harder for minorities to shake off this type of inherent prejudice than majorities.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Jake Karpman¬†First, you may want to investigate the difference between bias and \textbf{racism}. What you are referring to is bias and, yes, we all do have biases. With regards to the resume study, however, prejudice and \textbf{racism} sneaks into these scenarios since workplaces are supposed to be equal opportunity landscapes. If bias excludes someone from opportunity, especially when it is a "sight unseen" situation and based on judgments about a name-- that hints at more than bias and leans towards the possibility of prejudice. When that prejudice (or even bias) outright and solely excludes someone from the process of competing for a job, that is \textbf{racism}. Consider also that with whites being the majority in this country...and if whites in a supervisory position only want to be around (as you put it) their own kind, how is a \textbf{black} person supposed to earn a living? Get a job? A promotion, raise a family, pay for college, etc.? Exclusion based on \textbf{race} is \textbf{racism} whether it's rooted in the simple bias you speak of or whether it begins with prejudice-- the result is the same. \textbf{Racism} is using one's power to deny someone else an opportunity simply because of the color of their skin. This is why so many argue that blacks, as a whole, cannot be \textbf{racist} against whites. Bias, yes. Prejudice, yes. But in order to practice \textbf{racism} against whites, we have to control the power structure and have the ability to shut them out of opportunities. We simply don't have the power or ability to systematically do that.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Race, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}9/261 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.448 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I see I've sparked something of a debate, but I'm afraid I just can't get on board with Tumblr and SJW's particular brand of "justice". Any community that hosts TERFs (trans-exclusionary radical feminists) and gives them a voice has a serious problem in my opinion. Not to mention the abject \textbf{racism} towards white people shown by a large amount of the SJW community, and their seeming misunderstanding of the difference between institutional \textbf{racism} (which largely only affects non-white people) and \textbf{racism}, which can affect anyone.Furthermore, Tumblr is a community infamous for never being able to cite sources or quote actual facts, and is instead a melting pot for false statistics, rumours and folklore, which SJWs capitalise on to create a bastardised, paranoid view of the world in which white/cis/het people are out to destroy minorities. That's the reason I praised John for citing actual sources in this video.But finally I would say that the biggest problem for Tumblrites/SJWs is their utter inability to take criticism. If your goal is equality then that's admirable, but the amount of people I've seen deny any form of criticism towards how they're going about it by simply replying with a barrage of abuse is staggering. If you're a \textbf{woman} and you don't like the way that the feminist movement operates, they don't listen to your opinion and take it onboard, they tell you that you have 'internalised misogyny'. The invalidation of anyone who isn't a minority (and lately a lot of people that are, i.e. white \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} men) is a problem.We all have things to contribute to the ongoing discourse about social justice, and we need to throw away the pettiness and the prejudice, and give minorities voices without silencing people in majorities, because they have useful things to contribute too, even if they are criticisms.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gay, Racism, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General, Gender - General, Sexual Identity - General, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality & \cellcolor{green!27}6/305 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.967 \\  \hline

Are your numbers based on probability or just sheer number of incidents, because the population of each \textbf{race} inhabiting America is vastly different?Why are blacks and whites the only ones included here?

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Is the \textbf{racism} merited: No, otherwise it wouldn't be \textbf{racism}. If you're not calling people back when the only difference is their name, there is no other reason than \textbf{racism}.Is it really \textbf{racism}, or is it cultural clash? Police are more likely to stop and search \textbf{black} people, even though they're more likely to actually find something if they stop and search a white person. How is that 'cultural clash?'. Even if it is cultural clash, does that make a difference, especially if your main way of telling what culture someone belongs to is the colour of their skin.Are the numbers based on probablilty etc? John was talking about percentages and rates, so the absolute sizes of the two populations is irrelevant (as long as your sample size is sufficiently large).Why are blacks and whites the only ones included here? Good question, probably because it's a 4 minute video and white people are the majority and \textbf{black} people the largest minority in the US.As to your last question; yes, that's what John was saying when he talked about the influence of class, socio-economic status, etc. Thing is a lot of that is tied up with \textbf{race} as well.

I know there are countless other sources like it. If any human being is dressed like a thug, blaring the profane type of rap music they will be profiled more closely as a criminal. I certainly don't have any numbers for this, so it isn't a credible statement, but don't most worse off \textbf{black} kids dress this way? The reason why I ask is how are these numbers affected when it's a very knowledgable, wealthy, well dressed \textbf{black} man? I would be very interested in finding a credible source that presents that information.

The culture perpetuates ignorance, and criminal profiling, and I didn't want to be a part of that.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@John-Alan Pascoe¬†I somewhat disagree on the callback part and here's why (short version). People on average like familiar looking people which most of the time are the same \textbf{race} as you (parents at least if you are not adopted, community you live in etc.) This is an average. Some white people react better to asians, some blacks better to whites etc.So if I' running a law firm for a court room defense lawyer in a predominantly white neighbourhood area, why shouldn't I choose the white guy or girl with the identical resume when I know it most likely will affect their job performance?A lot of job are about perception and whether you like it or not, a white person in something that is visible and in a white area (btw US is 67 white so it's pretty damn likely)¬†Let's use my example of a defense lawyer. As John already mentioned in the video, \textbf{black} people are more likely to have longer prison sentences, so we know the courts, without a shadow of a doubt, are biased am I right? So, this most likely would mean, a white defense lawyer with the same abilities as a \textbf{black} one, is still going to outperform him which is why I think in those cases it's ok because your \textbf{race}, whether you like it or not, is a factor unlike when it comes to cognitive abilities etc.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}4/237 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.688 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I do agree, familiarity can be wrongly perceived as \textbf{racism} and discrimination. It's all about relative association and inclination. A \textbf{black} person may be more used to being around \textbf{black} people, whites with whites, Asians with Asian, because we tend to believe the \textbf{race} will carry the typical values and habits of the culture, which is 100 not a bad thing it's simply diversity, and would be easier to assume that the people of similar cultural background can relate. They view the social and technical aspects of the type of people they might typically be familiar with to be more secure in compliance, acceptance, and accountability. It's human nature, and there is no changing that. Familiarity is security and peace of mind. But again I have no citations or credible data supporting my statement, this is just from my experience which may be vastly different from others.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Race, Racism & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}4/147 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.721 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@lolpauveThe problem is this creates a vicious cycle: \textbf{black} people aren't hired as lawyers because lawyers aren't \textbf{black}, and lawyers aren't \textbf{black} because \textbf{black} people aren't hired as lawyers.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!5}4/30 & \cellcolor{green!5}13.333 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small This world need to grow up and leave \textbf{racism} in the past (unfortunately, if it were to stop in a couple days, the "past" would then be 2014). Equal rights means equal rights, simple as that. A fair trial and trial by jury mean FAIR for everyone and fate is decided by a third, unbiased party. Also, the r√©sum√© thing, I think often times white people are more likely to be hired than nonwhite (not just \textbf{black} but all nonwhites) is because of this ridiculous imperialistic view that is shared among people that is formed not by personal beliefs but stereotypes (I am, unfortunately, slightly in this area. I tend to be ever so slightly biased even though I have slightly darker skin because of my Latino heratige. Just saying that skin color doesn't determine god biases). These stereotypes make it so if someone sees say a Mexican working for a car repair shop and a white man at the next car repair shop, they'd be most likely chose the ladder simply because of a national image that whites are more effective workers (obviously there's no correlation). I think that's why some people turn down \textbf{colored} skin people. Not because they want to but because the "have" to for better business.

My school offer higher level classes (IB classes in my case). I take almost all IB classes and I can say that those classes are about 75 white regardless of the Hispanic population. I have taken non-higher level classes and the ratio was usually 50-50 or more Hispanics than whites. Even within the IB classes, the white kids tend to preform better. I'm not at all saying that Hispanics are not as intelligent, but their families may not value education as much due to cultural differences, which could be part of the explanation for the statistic about minority schools not offering upper level classes.

I also think \textbf{race} has little to do with it, families do of course but we shouldn't be looking at it as a \textbf{race} problem because my anecdotal evidence shows me that it happens to all races and if we shove it into a \textbf{race} issue then we might miss the solution.

People can be consciously or subconsciously \textbf{racist} within this system, but basically it means that the actions and polices that govern our daily lives are typically influenced heavily by \textbf{racist} beliefs.So the person in charge of interviewing people for a job may not realize that they are favouring people named Brendan and Emily over people named Lakisha and Jamal, but they are doing so because they have internalized the belief that Brendan and Emily are more suitable, responsible, respectable, etc... all because their names suggest whiteness.¬†It's systemic because it's routinized and it comes naturally to us.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}5/117 & \cellcolor{green!5}4.274 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The System is a lot of systems combined into one force that majorly affects every aspect of life in America (and like, the world, but I'm in America so I'm just gonna try to stay in that lane). So like the healthcare system, the justice system, the educational system, the media system, are all parts of The System and all interconnect. This system is \textbf{racist}. A lot can be said about how it is inherently \textbf{racist} and built on \textbf{racism} and cannot thrive without \textbf{racism}, but that's like a lot and I don't want to overwhelm you. What's important is that the way the system is currently carried out is filled with \textbf{racism}, which is why all the statistics John provides happen. The system not only guides our lives, but shapes our thoughts and behaviors. Because of this, not only is the system \textbf{racist}, but the people within the system often carry out \textbf{racism} subconsciously.¬† This allows them to continue contributing and building a \textbf{racist} system whether or not they hate \textbf{black} people. In our \textbf{age}, \textbf{racism} doesn't always have to do with hating \textbf{black} people, but rather with denying them their humanity and basic human rights. It's hard to explain what the system is because it is literally EVERYTHING. It's a very complex entity that has been working against \textbf{black} people for a millenia, which is why it is so hard to destroy.So, for example, you asked do all races have the same rights and the answer is we have always all had the same rights. If we consider rights to be things like the right to free speech, we have always had that RIGHT. But it's been consistently denied. So even contextualizing the conversation as "don't we all have equal rights?" Is flawed because that was never the problem. The problem is that those rights have been denied. But it is a \textbf{racist} system that stops you from thinking about it in that way.Understanding that even the way we THINK about these problems is affected by \textbf{racism} allows you to understand how powerful and how silent it is. Thats the system. It is everywhere and nowhere and scary.And \textbf{racist}.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Black, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}16/364 & \cellcolor{green!27}4.396 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small its a kind of confusing thing, but basically the idea is that the system overwhelmingly favors white people than it does any other \textbf{race}. While technically everyone has the same rights, in application they don't because of the enforcement of those rights being unequal. So like he was saying \textbf{black} americans are much more likely to be charged for crimes by the justice system than white americans are. Systemic \textbf{racism} usually refers to the overall system being \textbf{racist} as opposed to lots of individuals being \textbf{racist} (although they still are.) I dont know if I'm making any sense? Its about how the system is structured in a way that it favors white people, and that is simply so ingrained into the system that its incredibly hard to change it.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Race, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}5/129 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.876 \\  \hline

I'm not denying the statistics, but could it be that more \textbf{black} people live in the ghettos and poorer towns/cities than white people, and the reason for most arrests/whatnot is largely influenced by wealth? As in perhaps the poorer you are, the more likely you are to commit crimes?I of course agree there is \textbf{racism} and there are \textbf{racist} cops, people, businessmen, and whatnot.

Again, a lot of reasons, most of them having to do with the \textbf{racism} embedded in the system.When we talk \textbf{race} we must talk class, because \textbf{racism} cannot be separated from class in our country. Which is something John mentioned toward the end of his video.So even saying "this has to do with lack of wealth" implies \textbf{racism}. Because \textbf{black} people aren't just inherently less capable of accumulating wealth. There is a reason.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small "institutionalized \textbf{racism}" is a garbage terms because we have no institutions for \textbf{racism}. Systemic \textbf{racism} is a concept that takes correlation and attributes it to causation (society is functionally \textbf{racist} as the cause of all racial differences). While many argue that addressing systemic \textbf{racism} is a mean to create equality, it is used as a means to create a reversal of oppression by considering all non-minorities as having guilt in subconscious actions. I am not saying there are no racial prejudices among individuals, but systemic \textbf{racism} implies that the majority of whites are subconsciously being \textbf{racist}.

MAYBE you could say it's prejudiced but it's not even that because it's not a statement based on preconceived notions. Saying that white people are often subconsciously \textbf{racist} is a fact, as proven by the numerous statistics that John noted in the video as well as by the plethora of testimonies from people of colour about the \textbf{racism} that they have faced.\textbf{Racism} relies on power structures and, in Western culture, white people have the power over people of colour. So it is not possible for people of colour to be \textbf{racist} because they do not hold the power to oppress white people - they can discriminate, they can be prejudiced, etc. But they cannot be \textbf{racist}.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Sincerely, Elle¬†What the hell is classcist? The reason I said poorer people are more likely to commit crimes is based off of their need for money and food. People who are better off don't need anything urgently, whereas poorer people are more likely to need things urgently but not be able to pay for it. So they resort to theft because they are more desperate.Am I pulling this out of my ass? Could be, I wasn't meaning to say this as fact, but more so the way I see things. I also thought I saw articles about this as well, but I guess I gotta find them first.Why are \textbf{black} people living in poorer places? I don't know. It could have to do with America's \textbf{racist} past and that white people are more likely to inherit wealth because they weren't put down, but \textbf{black} people aren't legally put down now. Could their past be negatively effecting them now? Sure, but what can we do about that?The way I see it is the best thing we can do is just be good people. I'm not going to treat anyone differently for superficial reasons.

This may seem like "circular logic" but it's just to say that culture is cyclical, and that this is both good and bad. To use a good example: Say one of the proponents of a culture is democracy. We teach that democracy is a great thing, that it requires certain freedoms, etc. Soon the way we think about the world is within the context of democracy. It is not longer an "idea" but simply is. "Of course I have freedom of speech. Duh." And thus, everything we make from the Internet to educational spaces allows freedom of speech and encourages it. We encourage it among ourselves. It becomes innate. Does democracy exist independent of us? No. If we stop encouraging it and enforcing it and carrying it out, and someone comes along and encourages, enforces, and carries out authoritarianism, then authoritarianism is gonna happen. But we aren't born believing in democracy (obviously. Babies are tiny dictators after all). We learn democracy from each other and from our culture.¬†The System teaches implicit \textbf{racism}. Then people internalize that, enact that and contribute to the system. After hundreds and hundreds of years, we internalize that \textbf{black} people are inferior. Then there is a break in that logic and we say "no, actually thats not true." What we are in the process of doing right now is breaking the cycle, but the break in that cycle is SO NEW that it hasn't been a clean one.¬† So laws aren't always \textbf{racist}, but the ways they are carried out often is. Same for, like, everything. We learn \textbf{racism} from each other and from our culture. But we could just as easily UNLEARN it in the same way.So when we try to say that only specific people are \textbf{racist}, we distance ourselves from the problem and we minimize it. We make it less of a problem than it really is. It's not that \textbf{racist} are in charge of the system. It's that we live in a culture that is \textbf{racist}, teaches that \textbf{racism} to everyone living in it, and then everyone living in it enacts that, adding to that culture, making it \textbf{racist}, and repeat.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Since Ferguson happened I have been thinking about \textbf{racism} in Germany and I don't know if our \textbf{racism} is the same as the one in the US. In Germany it's more about nationalities and social backgrounds that are discriminated against. Like if you only get ¬†9 years instead of 12/13 years of education has a lot to do with your parents \textbf{nationality} and job. We have problems with treating foreigners equally. There is a lot of prejudice against Turkish and Polish/Eastern European people and not against "\textbf{race}". And people from Eastern Europe do not look so much different than Germans, so its not really a \textbf{race} issue.¬†Which is why I do not understand the problem with "\textbf{African} Americans". Don't these people have an American citizenship? Have these \textbf{African} Americans got a dual citizenship? Why are you discriminating against your own people?Don't get me wrong, I hate it that especially Turkish boys will have a lesser chance to apply to Uni than German boys with worse grades, but it is far more understandable that \textbf{old} people complain about "those Turks" which they don't see as part of our society (which they are!) than about people that are actually the same \textbf{nationality}, but just look different! Our \textbf{racism} is more about national identity than \textbf{race}, as we are a bit sensitive when it comes to the word "\textbf{race}" and don't wish to repeat \textbf{old} mistakes.¬†The US on the other hand seems a bit fixated on races. Like when I fill out a survey or form on an American site, they sometimes ask for your \textbf{race}. That is so \textbf{weird}. Up until 3 years ago, I never even knew the term "Caucasian" and it sounds to me like a word for sea food...\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}African, Nationality, Old, Race, Racism, Weird & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Nationality - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}15/293 & \cellcolor{green!27}5.119 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The US's discriminatory practices are based more on the extremely profitable Slave trade that the US was entrenched in until 1808 (and Slavery itself, which ended in 1865 due to civil war). In that, \textbf{racism} became a useful mindset in justifying why you could own people, being that they were of a certain color.The taking of land from native populations also entrenched this idea I think, because they were societally different from the white settlers who took their land and well, they were almost like a different species that couldn't/wouldn't be understood (due to understanding not aiding efforts to gain a profit/land)\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Racism & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/103 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.971 \\  \hline

So why has the US never done this? They know about the \textbf{Nazi} Regime and all of the horrors that they committed because of \textbf{racism}. They know that slavery was bad. They (should) know that killing the Native Americans was wrong. They learn about segregation, Rosa Parks, MLK, Civil Rights Movement as well as the crimes of the KKK in their history lessons, don't they?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small "\textbf{African} American" is just what people say largely as a substitute for \textbf{black}, because \textbf{black} can have a negative connotation.

I personally dislike the term because it implies that \textbf{black} people are somehow less American when it's likely that (if you're descendant from slaves) your bloodline has been in America longer than most "white" people's has.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Actually, a big part of the problem in Europe is that no matter how many generations a Turkish family lives in Germany they're still considered Turkish. The reason we don't just call Asian decedents living in America "asian" to describe their \textbf{race} is because they're not simply Asian, they're Asian American. The term \textbf{African} American evolved out of the other terms because it acknowledges their \textbf{ethnic} heritage while affirming their american identity. ¬†Germany, and other western nations, should really pick up a practice like this. For example, I have a group of Swedish friends I made abroad. One of them has a mother who was born in India, but adopted into Sweden as an infant. His mother doesn't speak Hindi, he doesn't speak Hindi, and he has never even been to India. Regardless, all of the Swedes think of him as being \textbf{Indian} and not Swedish. Isn't that wrong?¬†\textbf{Racism} is very different in the US. A fair amount of that has to do with us having a huge former slave population whose decedents are still facing discrimination. No other "western" \textbf{nation} really has had a comparable problem since they didn't have slave populations as large as the US. We also conceptualize our national identity very differently. If you move over to the US and live there for long enough, you're american. Even if you keep a huge amount of your national identity from your foreign \textbf{nation} or origin, even if you lived most of your life there, you can still be american.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}African, Ethnic, Indian, Nation, Race, Racism & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Ethnicity - Native-American, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}7/253 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.767 \\  \hline

For comparison to the half \textbf{Indian} Swede I know a half French Swede in the same friend group and no one has ever questioned him being Swedish. It's a racial issue and your data about immigration has \textbf{nothing} to do with that and is weirdly out of place. Also, while the British Empire had a lot of slaves, they were mostly kept in the colonies. Today the \textbf{black} population is about 3 of the British population compared to the 13 in the US. It's also worth noting that a large chunk of the 3 figure have immigrated there post slavery from one of Britain's many former colonies with whom Britain shares complex immigration policies with.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@NotTotallyHopeless‚Äã You're right. \textbf{Racism}, and its notion, in Europe differs from the US's. \textbf{Racism} seems to br more about \textbf{ethnicity} in Europe (I.e 'this person is from Eastern Europe so add some poorly made comments ect). They are more people from one \textbf{ethnicity} against  people from another \textbf{ethnicity} (with same colour of skin) in Europe than in the US where it seems to be more "\textbf{black} vs white". But one doesn't replace/erase the other - I don't deny you have both 'system' of \textbf{racism} in the US and Europe.

Why is this? Because of a long standing system of \textbf{racist} laws and businesses that gave advantage to whites over minorities, because of over two-hundred years of advantage white Americans had to build businesses during which \textbf{black} Americans were in slavery, because of the long-standing prejudice and \textbf{racism} on the part of business owners that led to \textbf{black} Americans being unable to get jobs, own good property, get good loans, etc. Certainly you can see this as a class problem, but when your classes are largely split on a color line, you have to admit it is also a \textbf{race} problem.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Race, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}6/136 & \cellcolor{green!27}4.412 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@dee jay Since you asked so nicely :) If you look at many of the factors  that go into college acceptance rates, many of them do not give equal opportunity to \textbf{African} Americans and other minority students. \textbf{African} Americans are more likely to suffer from poverty,  and are more likely to live in poverty stricken areas. This effects two major factors for getting into college; SATs and the prestige of the applicants high school.  Not only do poor areas have worse schools with lower budgets which damages a students SAT scores,  but unlike wealthier students, they can't afford personal tutors or even SAT classes. Wealthier public and private schools even offer these classes for free or at a discount which poor (mostly minority) schools cannot afford to do. There's also some cultural biases on the SATs,  but that's a whole other issue. As for quality of school, a minority student is more likely to go to a poor school district with lower academic standing than a wealthier majority white school district. So,  even if two students have the same grades and are both equally good students, the one from the poorer district will be less likely to get in. There are also some issues of \textbf{race} in applying to college that wealthy minority students face, such as letters of recommendation.  Older white teachers may (consciously or not) give minority students worse letters of recommendation or refuse to write one for them. Also, affirmative action in universities and colleges is generally created by the school itself. Some of these programs are used to try to help minority students, but many are in place to make the college seem more diverse in order to attract more applicants. I know the diversity index was something I thought about when I looked at colleges. Some states do have programs,  but they're not huge and don't have the wide impact on acceptance rates that people think they do. The state who is considered to have the biggest affirmative action plan is Texas who accepts the top 10 of each individual high school into its college automatically.  Diversity at their state universities has increased dramatically, but the program mentions \textbf{nothing} about \textbf{race}.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@BaresarkSlayneSince we've digressed to two separate topics, I'll address them individually:- \textbf{Racism} is a specific form of bias.¬† Of course, that bias can take many, many forms such as \textbf{sexism}, etc.¬† But given the context of this video, I think it's reasonable to keep our focus on the \textbf{race} aspects of bias.As far as that goes, it can be argued that the institutionalized \textbf{racism} of the US's past has been abolished but the effects of that are going to be strongly in effect for several more generations before they are gone.¬† Look at how long it took from the abolition of slavery to the civil right movement.¬† While official, institutionalized \textbf{racism} may have ended, it is an ingrained enough part of our culture that it is still quite reasonable to treat it ass if it were still an official institutionalized part of US culture.\textbf{Racism} is also definitely not dependent on skin color.¬† I get really incensed when people say that only white people can be \textbf{racist} against blacks and not vice versa.¬† It's an insanely simplistic understanding of \textbf{racism}.¬† (and bias in general)¬† It is quite easy for someone that is \textbf{black} to be \textbf{racist} against other \textbf{black} people.¬† Our media is inundated with imagery and music that trains all of us to think of young \textbf{black} men as thugs.¬† Even if you are \textbf{black} yourself, you don't get to escape that indoctrination.- I think you're missing my point here.¬† I'm trying to emphasize that you don't need a physical attribute as obvious as white/\textbf{black} skin color for bias to occur.¬† Just because you or I might have difficulty picking an Irish person out of a lineup of US citizens circa 1850 doesn't mean that someone back then would have.¬† Irish people do have a particular look that is fairly unique, just like you can generally distinguish someone that is Thai from someone that's Chinese, despite thousands of years of genetic crossover between those two cultures.If you looked even vaguely Irish back then, you would be discriminated against.¬† Do you think the people who did that cared that they occasionally discriminated against someone that wasn't actually Irish?¬† \textbf{Racism} is inherently stupid.As for the Jews in WWII, I used that example to point out that even a group of people that do not have a specific racial background can be effectively identified and discriminated against.¬†As for Haitians/Dominicans, if you read the link I provided, it explains that they forced people to speak the Spanish word for parsley.¬† Haitians have a difficulty properly trilling their 'R's and would be killed on the spot.¬† Over 20,000 people were butchered.¬†You are drawing an artificial distinction between group preference and out-of-group hate.¬† The instant that we start giving preferential treatment of those we are 'kin' to, we sow the seeds for \textbf{racism}, \textbf{sexism} and all the other terrible crap we've been talking about.¬† We live in a universe of limited resources and conflicting beliefs.¬† The instant an 'us vs them' dichotomy is set up, you inevitably set up the future stage for conflict.¬† For now, you may be genteel and cooperative but the instant there's a lack of food or jobs or a divisive argument about shared governance, that kinship means that you will preferentially side with your kin vs the other.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Race, Racism, Racist, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}16/556 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.878 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Dan Heidel¬†Holy god... I had a reply set up on that side bar drop down and it closed on me. ¬†I'll do my best to sum up my thoughts.- \textbf{racism} is a specific form of bias. ¬†But the language and meaning are two different things. ¬†Bias is neutral. ¬†Bias is your preference for things and basically exists as an environmental adaptation and it informs our social structures. ¬†It's natural and ingrained in us and is not \textbf{racism}. ¬†\textbf{Racism} is negative, it's a flash judgement based on \textbf{race} (ie. all latinos are criminals). ¬†This is a negative bias that informs us (most likely incorrectly) about what we should do when we come across this type of person. ¬†\textbf{Racism}, being a social construct, can clearly come from a bias like this. ¬†But having a natural preference is not the same as discriminating against something else that is not like you. ¬†That is a false dichotomy. ¬†Our feelings about anything land in a spectrum and the extremes would \textbf{racism} on one end and... excessive amounts of love for one's own features would be the other.. I guess. ¬†I don't know what the opposite of \textbf{racism} is actually. ¬†I would caution against lumping in things that are not \textbf{race} related with things that are though. ¬†Like, \textbf{sexism} is not the same as \textbf{racism}, and anti-religious sentiment is not either. ¬†Communism is a specific form of socialism, but it's not appropriate to label everyone who believes in a socially progressive form of government (ie. Liberal goverment) a \textbf{Communist}. The language is very important.My point is that it's important to understand that while \textbf{racism} is a type of extreme bias, it's not the same just having a preference for something, which is what a bias is. ¬†My main issue with treating bias as equal to \textbf{racism} is that you end up in a point where you can determine a persons intentions for them. ¬†It's like thought policing. ¬†Your brain is making decisions for you all the time. ¬†It makes so many in such a short time you can't even fathom it. ¬†One of those decisions is who are going to most likely be comfortable around. ¬†That is just reality, and to label that as the same as \textbf{racism} is not in alignment with reality.¬†- \textbf{racism} is a social construct, so you don't need a physical feature. ¬†But physical features are commonly shared among people of a given \textbf{race}. ¬†They don't look all the same, but all \textbf{black} people have dark skin (to varying degrees). ¬†All Haitians share a language (which is also a social construct). ¬†Jews are of a certain religion but many do not share physical features, so the Nazi's wiping out the Jews was not \textbf{racism} so much as anti-religious sentiment (heaped in with a good amount of scapegoating from Germany who was treated, quite frankly, unfairly by the treaty of Versailles). ¬†- I am not making artificial distinctions between group preference and out of group hate. ¬†You can say that when times get tough we are at each others throats, but that also denies all of the cooperation that has existed between varying groups since the beginning of western civilization. ¬†Far more cooperation has occurred. ¬†During the Holocaust, many Jews were evacuated or hidden by friends and neighbors who were not Jewish. ¬†I am curious to see how many Haitians escaped execution by this same means.- I don't know if I made this clear, but I'm not implying implicit egotism to everything John talked about. ¬†The only place I would put that on is the citation of the hiring study. ¬†Cops arresting more \textbf{black} people is not a simple bias. ¬†Cops literally make choices based on \textbf{race}, which is the definition of \textbf{racism}. ¬†I don't think that all police are \textbf{racist}, but I think that police organizations have ingrained \textbf{racist} tendencies that are backed up by their own self created statistics of crime rates. ¬†Incarceration studies are entirely correct when it shows average time difference between incarceration time and number of inmates incarcerated from various racial groups.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Communist, Race, Racism, Racist, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}22/679 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.24 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@BaresarkSlayneI know your pain, I hate the Youtube comment editing system.I think we're going to have to agree to disagree here.¬† It may be that your point isn't coming across completely clearly from having to retype it but I'm having trouble following your points here.I'm not sure why you draw the distinction between \textbf{sexism}, \textbf{racism} and other forms of bias, both personal and institutionalized.¬† They are all the same - the assumption that someone with a particular characteristic - having dark skin, believing in a particular god or economic system, etc etc defines who they are as a person are all fundamentally the same.¬† They all have the same basic causes.¬† \textbf{Sexual}, religious, cultural, and any other form of biased discrimination in existence have been institutionalized at some point.¬† \textbf{Racism} is not any more of a social construct than anything else either.¬† I challenge you to name any single distinguishing feature of \textbf{racism} that differentiates it from \textbf{sexism}, religious intolerance or any other bias-driven discrimination.¬† Yes, they are different because the underlying criterion for the discrimination is different but they are all otherwise identical.The thing I think that you are missing here is that \textbf{racism} and all other bias-driven discrimination are just that - a product of bias.¬† Money drives much of the injustice in the world while being a simple, ethically neutral construct.¬† Bias is the same.¬† Just because it is a simple, innate and morally neutral thing does not mean that its results are the same.\textbf{Racism} does not form in a vacuum, nor do the social constructs that support it.¬† They are all the very logical conclusion to our brains' tendency to categorize things and to then prioritize them.¬† The very act of privileging something means that you are commensurately denigrating its cognate.¬† Whether that means you're eating less meat in favor of vegetables, throwing a life preserver to a family member instead of a stranger or giving a job to a white person rather than a \textbf{black} one, the end result is the same.¬† Sometimes the act is morally reprehensible, sometimes it is neutral and sometimes it is good.¬† It does not change the fact that the underlying cause is the same.The fact that people have been cooperating throughout history does \textbf{nothing} to counter this fact.¬† People are not deterministic machines.¬† More than any other animal, we are capable of self-reflection.¬† We are inherently biased but we often see this in ourselves and make a conscious effort to fight it.¬† Just because many humans overcome the fear of the dark and the unknown in no way disproves the existence of that fear.¬† We expand the horizon of our bias to be larger than just our immediate kin to encompass cities, nations, empires and hopefully all of humanity.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Nothing, Racism, Sexism, Sexual & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}10/466 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.146 \\  \hline

To add to that, the ancient Greeks and ottomans didn't think of themselves as white. To them, the world was divided by language, not by \textbf{race}. Basically if you spoke Greek, you were Greek and if you didn't, you were a barbarian. Also, if you look at the region they're from I seriously doubt they were actually "white" by today's definition anyways. Ottomans and Greeks were probably racially similar. What separated them was \textbf{ethnicity} and culture.Besides, Ottomans (who don't exist anymore, politically) officially ruled the Greeks until about 180 years ago when they (the Greeks) declared their independence.

Bit of a strong word to describe certain inequalities, like saying someone apparently being denied freedom is speech indicates a modern \textbf{nazi} germany.Although this is mainly about the US, people keep talking about the "western world" and speak of it as exclusively the US.The year is just a number mind you, \textbf{nothing} changes unless people do something about it rather than believing that because time moves forward then so does social progress. But really it's only just a pet peeve I have.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nazi, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!5} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}2/149 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.342 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Blaze fair enough I guess I agree with you in a sense, that scientific discovery shouldnt really dictate whether or not we treat people well.But I think the use of 'we are in the year insert year here'....is to try and bring perspective into their argument? Like since the year \textbf{zero} weve been sharing the planet(and before that...) and yet still we are arguing coz people are born differently! Ok subhuman is a strong word to describe inequalities but sometimes when you read certain peoples opinions of other different people...they say things which make it seem as though some lives are of less worth than others...based on social class or skin colour or religion....whivh isnt exactly linked to the video so...sorry.I guess people usually link these things to the US as the vlogbrothers are american and use mainly American examples which people refer back to and then it becomes a hate-the-usa-fest. As well as the us being rich and the 'big country of the west' so its easy to pick on...and hearing racial prejudice in the news doesnt exactly help their case. dftba\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Zero & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!27}1/185 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.541 \\  \hline
