  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Dems insist that our President is \textbf{racist} because he is, as they say, against immigrants. They 'forget' to add the word 'illegal'. I think that even the word '\textbf{immigrant}' should not be used in these cases. Immigration is a legal procedure for crossing the border and becoming a member of the country. A country without borders is like a body without skin. Opening the border would be the end of our way of life. I, like so many more Americans, am an \textbf{immigrant}. The moment I crossed the border at the airport, I felt like everybody else, despite my ridiculous English.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small It's absolutely \textbf{racist} and completely habitually AND TRADITIONALLY American! Stop saying it's UNAMERICAN because it most certainly isn't and there are bodies of dead non-whites citizens and immigrants to prove it. Now, saying that it's NO LONGER an acceptable but still somewhat tolerated American attitude, IS MUCH more honest and correct. Yes, America still tolerates it because if they didn't HE WOULDN'T be the POTUS. If Americans were still so horrified by both his actions and words he would have been impeached already.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I don't know if this tweet was \textbf{racist}. He didn't actually say "go back to your country". He said that the four congresswomen should go back to the crime infested places from which they came. That doesn't necessarily refer to foreign countries; it could mean a city, a district, a state or a US territory. But even if it wasn't \textbf{racist}, it is CERTAINLY hypocritical!!!

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Demokkkrats are the real racists.  Fought for slavery. Started the kkk. This man complained about his country then ran for president to fix it, he didn't leave. He has enough money t do whatever he wants and chose to have the hardest job in the world. You people didn't like trump from the beginning and don't do any research yourself. He was never called a \textbf{racist}, sexist until the media declares him one and all you yuppies bought it. Larry King once asked him who would be his Vice President if he ran for president and he said Oprah. Oprah is \textbf{black} right. Hillary Clinton said all \textbf{black} people look the same.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I think you all should look up the true definition of hate speech plus historically the republicans were always for ending slavery whist the democrats were always for slavery, they turned it all around thru entertainment and took a typical democrat value based character like the \textbf{racist} Archie Bunker and pretended he was a republican. You should look into the historical records and you'll find the democrats were always the racists and ever since \textbf{black} people got the right to vote they just turned it all around pretending to be the non \textbf{racist} party in order to enslave the \textbf{black} population thru welfare and other measures to keep them bound to their \textbf{old} masters. By the way it's all theatre, freemasonry runs both sides and is trying to have the country to collapse from within in order to become socialist \textbf{communist} under a global new UN like structure after the third WW now that they helped to build up a worthy enemy in the allies between China and Russia against NATO. Ever since they ridiculed Bill Clinton in front of the \textbf{nation} for an affair to bring down the office of president, ever since they forced in W.Bush to show the elections were corrupt, ever since they had Hillary come out with Obama not being an American born citizen to bring down the constitution and now purposely created the total divide and non acceptance of a democratic elected president not my president. They're slowly breaking the US down from within on purpose. Globalism can't handle freedom of speech, gun rights etc. this is a long social engineering scam and fake opposition theatre and your all falling for it Just look into freemasonry presidents police military media music industry film industry banks religions NASA FBI CIA Fortune 500 companies or the fact that D.C. Is a private Freemason owned city state with Freemason border posts, the world council of freemasonry and a complete Freemason preplanned freemason symbolism layout whilst googling the Albert Pike Freemason Luciferian quote from his book reasons and dogma.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small As a person of color...My uncle (a citizen now) and I were talking about politics. He was saying how he's a slave here...so I said, "If it's so bad here why don't you go back then?". It's a war torn country, and honestly - I think it's silly that we should be adopting values of a country that has major issues. Why would someone come here to escape the problems of one country, only to bring those values and problems to this country? Even if I, someone born here, was showing favoritism towards the country of my parents, I don't think it's actually \textbf{racist} for someone else to say "Hey, if you like it there so much, why not move back to where you're originally from?" It's a bit of a wake up call - We have SO much freedom here, and WAY more security (Yes even given ALL the shootings and bombings and everything). There are bomb barricades, vehicle inspections.... Why do we need to adopt values that there are Caste Systems, that some people are less because of who they were born to? Those sound like shitty ideals - no thanks. If you think the rate of immigration has NO effect, you are \textbf{blind}. Ask yourself something: Should America accept EVERY application for immigration? What is the  rough number of ppl that should be allowed to immigrate? What is this number based on? Why isn't that number higher? Do you think it is possible for someone in government to show Bias towards countries that their parents come from? How? Conflicts of interest are not some new thing. I don't think these are \textbf{racist} tweets - why would he say "you're welcome to come back if you want." Why didn't he just say "Get the hell out of our country?"

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Tim Wilde first, bear in mind that an impeachment is a trial, the only trial that a sitting elected official can be indicted at. Very little is proven conclusively, but where there is enough evidence of possible wrongdoing, a trial is the only legal way to ascertain the truth. In this case, there is just too much evidence of possible criminality in the Trump Whitehouse to be ignored. First, the Mueller report may have not found evidence of direct collusion between Trump and the Russians, but it did show clear evidence that Trump may have personally obstructed justice in trying to end investigations into the administrations ties to Russia. The Report only stopped short of recommending prosecution because it wouldn't have been possible to do to a sitting president and Mueller felt it was beyond his remit to recommend a prosecution. Even so, over 450 former prosecutors from both sides of the aisle signed an open letter stating that if Trump were a private citizen and the case had been on their desks, they would have indicted him for obstruction based on the evidence in Mueller's report. That alone would be enough to at least impeach the president and have a court with real power over him ascertain the truth in this matter.Then you have the litany of other allegations of corruption. According to Trump's personal lawyer, Stormy Daniels was paid hush money from Trump's personal accounts and paid by that lawyer on orders from Trump himself, *during an election campaign*. This is an unequivocal violation of US campaign finance law if true. Trump has also refused to completely divest himself of his personal business interests, and in particular has continuously used his own hotels such as Mar A Lago and the Trump International Hotel DC for official state business, thus profiting hugely from all the meetings, hotel stays and use of facilities that foreign officials, lobbyists, etc have used while trying to get access to the President. This is most likely a horrendous conflict of interest in itself, and also leads to a huge amount of other possibilities in the realm of paying for access to an elected official. Then there's his horrendous personal behaviour that utterly brings the office of the Presidency into disrepute. He has made hugely \textbf{racist}, bigoted statements as president, of which the comments against the so-called Squad are only the most recent. He leads rallies that I would skirt the boundaries of Godwin's law to describe. He shuns other leaders of Western Democracy to cosy up to dictators and tyrants like Kim Jong Un, Erdogan, Putin and Crown Prince Salman Al Saud. Oh and there are even allegations that he attended some of Epstein's parties back in the 90s, with one girl in particular saying she was chosen to be raped by Trump at 15 because she was wearing a blond wig and "reminded him of his daughter", which is particularly telling considering all of the seriously creepy stuff Trump has said on record about Ivanka.I have more, but YT comments have a character limit.All of these are allegations. \textbf{Nothing} is proven in court, but that's exactly what a fair impeachment trial would do. Unfortunately, such a trial would be impossible while the Senate Republicans led by Mitch McConnell refuse to act in good faith and instead hold to partisanship at all costs, which is why I suggested that instead, we wait until he leaves office and then indict him as a private citizen.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nothing, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/583 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.343 \\  \hline

The illegals brought it upon themselves when they bum-rushed our border. They put themselves into a situation that exists now. Mexico used to do a much better job of stopping them at the southern end of their country until Trump started insulting them and their government, Add his rediculous wall into the equation and the actual wall that Mexico was providing simply faded from view, I don't blame them at all it is their way of letting Trump know to revise his thinking. Unfortunately, he does not have the intellectual acuity to see it. Even so, we cannot simply allow thousands of undocumented individuals to just aimlessly roam our streets. The quickest fix is to send military transports to take them back to their own countries, at least until we can upscale our facilities. We use to have Ellis Island on the east coast I guess we need something similar in Texas. I guess the "Progressive" types would have us put them all up in a Holiday Inn.

Twitter will ban him once he's not President, and you will go back to only knowing about him as that one guy who puts his name on buildings and fired people on TV. You have the power to change it, not with tweets, not with comment sections, but with votes. Stop bitching, and do everything you can to make sure you and those who agree with you vote.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small El Speedo I think you should look up the true definition of hate speech plus historically the republicans were always for ending slavery whist the democrats were always for slavery, they turned it all around thru entertainment and took a typical democrat value based character like the \textbf{racist} Archie Bunker and pretended he was a republican. You should look into the historical records and you'll find the democrats were always the racists and ever since \textbf{black} people got the right to vote they just turned it all around pretending to be the non \textbf{racist} party in order to enslave the \textbf{black} population thru welfare and other measures to keep them bound to their \textbf{old} masters. By the way it's all theatre, freemasonry runs both sides and is trying to have the country to collapse from within in order to become socialist \textbf{communist} under a global new UN like structure after the third WW now that they helped to build up a worthy enemy in the allies between China and Russia against NATO. Ever since they ridiculed Bill Clinton in front of the \textbf{nation} for an affair to bring down the office of president, ever since they forced in W.Bush to show the elections were corrupt, ever since they had Hillary come out with Obama not being an American born citizen to bring down the constitution and now purposely created the total divide and non acceptance of a democratic elected president not my president. They're slowly breaking the US down from within on purpose. Globalism can't handle freedom of speech, gun rights etc. this is a long social engineering scam and fake opposition theatre and your all falling for it Just look into freemasonry presidents police military media music industry film industry banks religions NASA FBI CIA Fortune 500 companies or the fact that D.C.

A signficant number of the "best" people he chose have been terminated, have resigned or are in prison or facing serious charges. The US has been now proven as one of the worst countries in the world in its disregard of the respect of basic human rights, as according to the declaration of Human rights and the ONU.  And now a known \textbf{sex} offender has been proven to have been given a plushy plea deal by the now extinct secretary of Labor.  And now he goes on to attack 4 Americans citizens, who happen to be women, from the Democratic party, based on the tone of their skin.  He is on the attack, meaning on the defensive, using whatever mad scenario he can use to regain control.  Because that is the way it seems.  His \textbf{racism} was always there, however spinned in controlled sentences.  But now , even this early in the game, which seems to me to be a big mistake on his part, he seems desperate enough to try to belittle those 4 women's achievements.  Seems to me trump is behaving like a cornered and pathetic candidate for his reelection.  I may be wrong, but I do not recall any presidential candidate ever having had to stoop so low that early in the game.

A 2 Party System Changes Virtually \textbf{nothing}. A "Third Way" Party could have its Best ever chance in this current, deeply fragmented Political Climate that may, God Forbid, continue for the next 12 years !  So many people "Feel" Dissatisfied Disappointed, Unheard \& Disenfranchised, that the Next President will be Most likely to be Elected by less than 50 of folks Eligible to Vote ! And the Current Crop are to busy 'In-fighting' to See that Voter Registration Reform will have Offices open from 10am - 12pm, then 2pm - 4pm Mon - Fri.You will need 4 - 5 pieces of Identity, 2 which must be Photographic \& Less than 2 years \textbf{Old}.

And kept Family aware of what could suddenly happen, in case Families wanted to be prepared, beforehand, to make Plans to move - into the Republic of Ireland, to Scotland or England, or further afield to Europe, Australia, New Zealand (Where Every Irish person, of whatever Creed, has Relatives!) Or, of course, the US of A !When recently at a Family Occasion, not happy, but typically Irish, I was in a group discussion of Trump and what he's doing to America and a quick Poll went around the Room. A rough 75 were RoI, E.U. Australia \& New Zealand. HOME in N.Ire. Canada: 12-14. Shockingly: Dubai, U.A.E. was 5. With, because of Family, 5-8 the U.S.A.

His Information, which I checked before this, was there were up to 30 times more people trying to Legally Enter,  and the Next Largest Group (having the Least Trouble !) Were Former Soviet Citizens, who were trying to Enter through Canada ! There were also significant numbers coming from the East Russia Region, into Alaska and easily being granted \textbf{Immigrant} Status - as long as They stayed (I think it was) 5-6 years - but this didn't apply to Minors at their Initial Entry. I know, from having spent time interacting with them in a Charity and spending time in Belarus schools assessing Children for our Program, that these kids made Irish kids, North \& South, look like they were being Educated by a Robot on "Rote Mode, Answer No questions Not on the Curriculum !"

Oh wait, maybe the Hitler one, but that's because Hitler was less \textbf{dumb}. Neo-Nazis certainly seem to love Trump so it's not quite far off though. As to why is he still there? A combination of factors, one, you assume Americans don't like those qualities, but that's what the Republicans stand for. So being \textbf{homophobic}, sexist, incompetent, corrupt, adulterer, tax evader, transphobic, anti semitic, \textbf{racist}, etc aren't cons, they're pros. That's what they like. The other factor is heavy gerrymandering and vote suppression (and as we found out straight up vote fraud), allowing a Congress that has received more votes for Democrats but is dominated by Republicans, which since that's what their party stands for, they will enable this. Same reason why he won the presidency but 3 million more Americans voted for the other candidate. Also, the majority of Americans do believe these things, because they know they're true.

His job is to preserve protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, to uphold and to enforce federal law - not to violate it.""If he had ordered his aides to violate federal law to save a human life or preserve human freedom, he would at least have a moral defense to his behavior.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small It's funny: for people like Trump and movements like MAGA, their intrinsic position that America is fundamentally broken and must be fixed, is framed as a form of "love"; yet when their ideological "enemies" do the same because they see the freedoms and values of their society going down the drain, it's framed as "hate". So what's the difference? Isn't that hypocrisy?I guess the difference is that when Trump demands that America be great again, it's an Orwellian double-think. Within that single slogan, America is simultaneously broken and complete; it's wrong but also right; it's weakened but unassailable; it must change yet it's already perfect.You see, when they chant "Make America Great Again", they aren't really talking about America as a country. They're using the term as a synonym for the people and the culture as they define them. Thus, the enemy are the people, ideas and stories which they believe do not belong. To the  MAGA movement, the problem with "America" is that it is no longer just "them". The \textbf{nation} has followed its logical ideological path and become so much more. Yet in the eyes of MAGA, America is being destroyed by that which does not belong. But most importantly, America is being destroyed by those people who are not them. That's how the double-think is be self-rationalised.Yet from the other point of view -- the "enemy" -- there is no desire to remove Trump and his supporters from the country or exile them from society. Regardless of their actions today, they are an integral part of a functioning democracy. The other side wants to reason with them and come to a consensus -- to collectively agree upon a reality which is acceptable for the whole \textbf{nation}, not just by one angry and spiteful minority and it's megalomaniacal leader.That's love, actually. No pun intended. That's love for one's country and culture, and its people and their stories. Hatred, on the other hand, is to purposely lead a people towards cultural oblivion because the fear and the spite are so blinding that the very things the people profess to love are trampled and destroyed.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nation & \cellcolor{green!27}Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/359 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.557 \\  \hline

Is there anyone other than the brainwashed puppets that did not see they puppy dog on a leash that was on display in Finland? NATO, Canada, The UK, Germany et al get a ribbing, but  Putin and KJN get passes based on their mere say-so. One thing i will say - he knows his game and he plays his pawns brilliantly. His comment about shooting someone in Fifth Avenue and still hanging onto his supporters is spot-on, for he could rob an \textbf{old} granny, hack a panda to death and ban ice cream, all in plain sight, and the bleating flock of apologists would STILL find a way to talk around it.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}1/226 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.442 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Why is it that anything that is regarded as criticism is deemed \textbf{racist}?The definition of \textbf{Racism} is "prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different \textbf{race} based on the belief that one's own \textbf{race} is superior."So if you disagree with someone's behavior or beliefs, that does not classify as \textbf{racist}.\textbf{Racism} is not ONLY meant for people of color. If you are a person of color who is prejudice (based on the definition above) to a white person... You are \textbf{racist}.Ilhan Omar is a \textbf{racist} based on her anti-semitic comments.Because Trump is singling out 4 people who are aggressive towards him, which he does to white people as well ( based on comments like sleepy chuck todd, pencil neck schiff etc etc...), that does not make him \textbf{racist} or sexist JUST because it was directed at people who happen to be women and are of color.In reverse, are those 4 congresswomen \textbf{racist} because they speak against a white man? If that is true that everyone that disagrees with each other based on policy, belief or anything else is \textbf{racist}.It's funny how everyone forgets that this started with Obama (deporter in chief) but they forget to call him out on it....Hypocrites\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Race, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}11/209 & \cellcolor{green!27}5.263 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Because of shows like this people are being lied to as to what \textbf{racism} is. To call this \textbf{racism} is an insult to every man, \textbf{woman}, and child who have been the victims of \textbf{racism}. To somehow put this in the same category as a family having to watch their husband/father hung or, beaten, or set on fire due to the color of his skin is one of the most insulting things I have ever heard. It amazes me that in these instances people who have lived with \textbf{racism} their whole lives let lies like this be told. It is a travesty that four somewhat spoiled young ladies will face a situation like this and somehow feel they have endured \textbf{racism}. It is a travesty that someone is convinced this is \textbf{racism}. It is a travesty that someone will read this tweet and now think they know what \textbf{racism} is. All that does is cause a person who is one day told by another that they have been the victim of \textbf{racism} to not really understand the extent of what they have been through. To believe this is the type of thing \textbf{racism} is is to really think \textbf{racism} isn't all that bad and not understand the true pain it brought. In other words, someone shares they have been the victim of \textbf{racism} and the thought comes to mind, 'Oh, like those four women who were insulted by the president?' The tweet was wrong. It was appalling even, but if these women think that this is \textbf{racism}, they have no clue as to what \textbf{racism} really is and should be educated before they speak. This is just my opinion but I doubt any of these young women have experienced true \textbf{racism}. It is and ugly, ugly thing but it is not having someone tweet something about you that hurts your feelings. It is an insult to the many men, women and children in graves due to the color of their skin.

I will never forget the day they came to my door to demand how many TV's I own, to pay the 'TV tax'... I told them to go away and eat my feces, it's none of their business how many TV's I own.  You couldn't even get a model airplane, with accurate markings from WW2, because certain symbols are 'verboten', totally missing the irony that restricting rights of expression is exactly what fascism was.  And then their entire manner was rude... For example, I will never forget how, upon waiting for meat at a deli, they would constantly simply walk in and cut in front of me, as if it was to be expected...  whenever I dated a \textbf{woman}, she would quickly launch into speeches on how evil the US is and how horrible the American food is— I will never forget, the parents of the \textbf{woman} I was dating did exactly that, just as I was sitting down to eat their dinner!

( I just googled the legality of teachers sharing  political views...paraphrased below)  Apparently, many states forbid teachers to espouse their political views, and require teachers to remain politically neutral. In fact, some of these laws have been upheld in places such as San Diego!  On a personal note,  I have taken several online classes over the past two years and have not recently experienced  a single incident where a professor shared their viewpoint.  But as you know it still surely happens, and in your case, I would have called the FAA as well, because that teacher was definitely being reckless.   You may agree or disagree, but I will throw another topic into the mix, because I think its relative.  I am strongly against teachers, expressing their personal viewpoints about religion in class. In my state it is NOT illegal. But I will take the matter to court if I have to, I do not want my children learning anything about religion in school, unless they are taught about all religions matters of faith or the lack thereof such as atheism. In one view is discussed then all views need equal time to be equally discussed, and just the facts, not opinions.  I only want my kids to learn about religion at home or in church.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}1/283 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.353 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@David Vazquerz and Craig Smith First of all I would like to thank you for coming to a left wing channel, It shows real character to come and see what the other side is saying, rather than staying in your own echo chambers. I would also like to thank you for voicing your opinions on this section and giving us something to debate. Finally I wish to apologies for the rude treatment that you've been subjected to by mrcluein, Susan B, and Stealth Attack. They don't seem to understand that yelling insults at people doesn't help anyone, and rather makes them dig in their heals rather then opening a line of communication so that we can debate those we disagree with, and possibly change minds or at least come to an understanding with.Now that that's out of the way, please allow me to retort a few points you made. Particularly you Craig Smith.I agree that were not now under a dictatorship, however many of us on the left do fear that we're heading towards a more dictatorial form of government becoming the norm. It's our belief, and it's something that I feel as if the Republicans seem to have lost since Trump took office, that it's the duty of the voting citizen to check the power of our leaders, by calling out their pros and cons, discussing those pros and cons, and then voting on whether we as a collective society believe that their pros are better then their challengers, or if their cons are just to much for us to put up with. The Republicans used to call out Obama for his flaws, and in many cases you where right. But Trump is constantly testing our democracy. He's shown himself to be either inept, like the time he destroyed everyone on seal team five's careers, and put them,their families, and their missions in danger by posting a picture of them on twitter. Or he's malicious like how he even after they where proven not guilty, he still called for the continued imprisonment of the central park five. From what I've seen I believe it's a bit of both.Next, you did say that the Republican party freed the slaves and gave \textbf{woman} their rights. This is only half true and in a flimsy way at that. Lincoln did free most of the slaves, and both the left and right celebrate him for that to this day. However It was democrats under Woodrow Wilson who had power when women started to receive their rights. Also I think it's clear that the left and right switched places on many of the civil rights arguments since the civil rights act passed and the Republicans enacted the southern strategy. The \textbf{old} Democrats where responsible for doing horrible things, like the \textbf{Indian} removal act put into place by former Democratic party leader and president of the US, Andrew Jackson. That lead to one of the worse acts of genocide that the western hemisphere had ever seen. (that's the person that Trump decided was worthy of putting his picture up in the oval office to be a source of inspiration. So I don't think the argument that the Democrats of today are anything like the democrats of those times, or that the Republicans of today are anything like the Republicans that started the party holds much water.Sorry for the long post (I kinda love history) but if anyone has anything to say to farther this conversation I would be happy to listen.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Indian, Old, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - Native-American, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/590 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.508 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small DeepIn Thought I think you're a little mixed up in your history.  Andrew Jackson was long, long before the Civil War, and indeed had little to do with the Civil War, or with either party during the Civil War.  There were probably Republicans who idolized Andrew Jackson during the Civil War (because Jackson was very much anti-nullification, in fact he HATED John C Calhoun, who was a darling of the South and was the harbinger of the Confederacy, you might say).  In other words, Andrew Jackson, Democrat, was a hero of the Republicans of the Civil War— he and Lincoln had a lot in \textbf{common}.  Anyway, I don't really see how you can defend the statement that Republicans of the Civil War are 'not anything like' Republicans of today.  I do see a lot of the same racialism in today's Democrat party as existed in the Democrats of the 1850s, but that's another topic.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Common & \cellcolor{green!5}Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}1/154 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.649 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The party platforms never switched. They both used different voting strategies but congressional voting is where you find out where the parties stand and they are the same as they were then with a few exceptions. Like \textbf{racism}.

Call the other \textbf{racist} and we will get votes even tho I don't think anyone k owe what \textbf{racism} is lol because it's used for insulting a smarter person. Conservative don't use that approach . they use facts and promises of higher paying jobs and less taxes. Which I will tell you now that has never changed. Taxes are always higher during a dems pres term than a rep. Like I said the parties never changed. As for the slavery vote and so.ans rights. Not one dem voted yay to either bill. It was all reps yay and all dems nay. I will look at the book again later and tell u the date and the votes counted on both bills. But same as today if it betters the American people and is good for the economy the reps vote yes and the dems vote no. Like the border funding aid bill. You still saying they switched lol. Why would the dems vote no on a bill that helps illegal immigrants ? Because it doesn't benefit them in any way. I know what I've read is accurate the author is the Senate magistrate book keepers Union. So the votes are accurate yet u try to refute. I'm wondering why. You don't like your parties past?

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Rioanda LOL 'things have changed in the last decade' and LOL 'I had asthma so I couldn't serve' LOL....  sweetheart, I entered the United States Marine Corps many decades ago, with deformed feet and knee problems to the point that I was told I wouldn't be able to walk by the time I was 25 or 30.  I said to hell with that and I worked and I worked to build myself up, and I cajoled/shamed/yelled at the \textbf{doctors} until they finally relented and let me in, and I not only attended but I graduated from the Naval Academy.  I knew some of my fellow Marines who had asthma or other physical issues that they powered through and got over, and made excellent Marines.  Your mindset is EXACTLY why you never served— your will was not strong enough to overcome your limitations.  If you don't even have the instincts and drive to serve in the military no matter what, then you certainly don't have the killer instincts to be a Marine.  Again, you're a coward who never served, period.  And again, no, the CodeTalkers are not 'yours'.  'My granddaddy did x, therefore they're ‘mine''.... whatever.  My father served in combat in WWII, and eve I don't consider his unit 'my' unit, because I didn't earn the right to say so.  If i didnt, you sure as hell didn't, who didn't even serve.As for Trump not serving, I wasn't even born during Vietnam, but if I'd been of \textbf{age} at the time, I sure as hell wouldn't have allowed myself to be drafted—- only the morons went to that war, the smart ones went to college or otherwise stayed out of it.  Vietnam wasn't my war, and it certainly wasn't yours.  So don't try to use it as an excuse for why you yourself were too cowardly to serve.  'Waaah I had asthma'.  Cry me a river.  I had much worse and I served.  And on top of that, after I was badly injured in Iraq (to the point that I needed massive surgery, and an entire year of physical rehabilitation to recover), on top of that, I was accepted to, joined and served in civilian law enforcement in a large city— I built myself back up until I could run and fight just as I could years before.  So get out of here with your 'asthma' story.  Your inability to serve has \textbf{nothing} to do with anything physical— it's because you're weak mentally.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Nothing, doctors & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Youngsters, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/414 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.725 \\  \hline

"If you are to criticize what Im doing first look at where you originated from.

But because she was the heir apparent for so long, it left a lot of time for the right wing to build her up as a \textbf{boogie} man based on all sorts of fake narratives, conspiracy theories, innuendo, outright lies, and some legit bad things. She definitely wouldn't have been my first choice, but if she was president now, the economy would still be where it is, as much wall would have been built as under Trump, but Iran would still be in compliance with the nuclear deal, all the industries Trump promised to help wouldn't have spent the last two years suffering under tariffs, people at the border would be treated more humanely, our international alliances wouldn't be frayed, the environment wouldn't be getting intentionally decimated at the behest of large corporate sponsors and the constant embarrassing spectacle would be replaced with a dignified presence. So not my first choice at all, but I'm convinced 'anybody but Trump' was always a better position than 'anybody but Clinton.' She'd have been, ehh, okay. Anyway though, that's all the past.

I'm not sure how much the border Patrol needed for the recent rise in detainees at the border for food beds and more building space but  the Republicans voted for it and no surprise the democrats voted against it. You seeing a pattern yet? It's been this way since during slavery which people like to say the parties switched when in fact they didn't cause the same is happening now.

It's like the Trump Crime Crew has been in their huddle listening to every play being called by the Democrats from the get go. Simply put, the Press doesn't dwell on all that legislative s**t because The Trump Crime Crew has a fire hose of lies, bad policy, corruption, crime, and racial xenophobic treasonous chaos going 24/7 that drowns out all the regular \textbf{old} stuff that use to make up everyday Wahington life. The dumbass Democrats had only one play after Barr suppressed and mischaracterized the Mueller Report. Impeachment! A live T.V. trial versus The Trump Crime Crew firehose of chaos. That was they're only choice and they blew it. That was the one thing The Trump Crime Crew feared. Witness after witness on live t.v. either lying or pleading the 5th or telling the truth and snitching off those who  committed perjury. And everyday Republican Senators in Swing States up for election would have to justify supporting the Trump Crime Crew on live T.V. as the entire \textbf{nation} watches riveted to their screens. That's the only thing that could of overwhelmed the Trump Crime Crew's hold on the daily narrative that continues to make the Democrats look weak and ineffectual. It doesn't matter if the Senate Republicans don't convict. All the better actually. They'll look just as corrupt as the Trump Crime Crew after weeks and weeks of testimony on live T.V. proving without a doubt the Trump Crime Crew's guilt. And I got news for you, Americans may not like hooking up with an asshole  like Trump, but you know what they really don't  like hooking up with?  WEAK AND INEFFECTUAL!  Yeah, Americans would rather be assholes and win then be ineffectual weaklings and lose. That's why Trumps BASE will never go for these weak ass Dems. And more and more of the 2018 Bue Wave are feeling the same. Witness the riff in the Dem Party. Centrist weaklings versus the new tough young "take no prisoner" Progressive Liberals like the Squad.

Republicans run a dude that has a lifetime record of scumbaggery and the Dems run a woman--for the first time in our nation's hidtory--who gave her entire life to public service but she wasn't the absolute perfect child so she deserved to be treated even worse than the f**king Bad Seed.Bottom line, you're either too lazy of a parent to take the time to see the obvious difference between your two children or your biased toward the Bad Seed and thusly are working overtime to make them BOTH seem the same.
