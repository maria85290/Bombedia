The audience is way larger now and they are not all hip hop purists, the radio isn't designed for hip hop purists - its designed for people who dont care enough to choose their own music. They dont care enough to analyze and break down wordplay, they want to be entertained with uptempo beats and popular phrases that are easy to access. Let them have it.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small It seems that the actual complaint from Ken, Beezy, Myke \& others in that \textbf{age} range (I'm 31 like Feefo) is that its not easy enough to find quality music through mainstream channels.  Sad to say that hip-hop doesn't live in the mainstream, which it never really did ... when you say that Public Enemy was mainstream, that's not necessarily that accurate.  They were one of the more popular groups of the small emerging culture, but Def Jam was an independent label run out of a dorm room, it just seemed major.  And the EPMD's \& such came out on independent labels like Sleeping Bag Records \& played on college radio.  \textbf{Black} radio even hated rap music.  You couldn't see \textbf{Black} music on MTV at all until Michael Jackson's 2nd (Epic records) solo album if I remember correctly.  It was always a culture of digging.  But those of us who experienced music in the 90s got spoiled with Death Row, Bad Boy, No Limit, etc. breaking through as hip-hop took over MTV \& mainstream culture.  You have to except that hip-hop is counter culture and belongs to the underground and don't put weight in the complex's and other platforms that don't represent the voice of the culture, and not look to them to elevate our artists and to have the same standards that we do.  The big problem is that after a certain \textbf{age}, people stop digging for music due to responsibilities and a sort of \textbf{age} barrier to technology.  Mid 30s \& up aren't on boxden everyday looking for all the leaks, unless you're Kinge \& you have to listen to every release lol or you're more of a DJ type.  So when people say its a youth driven culture, and the commercial (commerce) aspect focuses on that under 30 ... that's why, because older than that aren't making an effort to find music, and are less likely to look to buy new releases every week, unless you're a digger. ... In that respect, as a music maker, I've realized how many people do rely on traditional mainstream outlets to filter music for you, and have more of a desire to make the Regulates that everybody will experience, instead of having to spam people on social media and get ignored.  So I can see both arguments\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Black & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!5}5/387 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.292 \\  \hline

Then I go see a group like flatbush zombies at the same venue and the place is packed from wall to wall to the point where you can't move. Get the fuck outta here with that shit saying these other guys arn't poppin. Yoh is right, the machine gives you the illusion these guys are poppin and thats cus they have cheap viral fame... the artists that are actually selling out their merch, putting up numbers in sales, and selling out there shows are guys like joey, action bronson, mac miller, freddie gibbs, earl, danny brown, tde, flatbush, underachievers, and the list goes on and on. I go to these shows...the seemingly in the spotlight "trash" you guys say represents hip hop doesnt have nearly as much support when its time to show and prove. Not to knock migos or young thug cus I believe that music is great and its real hip hop as well. the fact of the matter is the artists that arn't around for a quick minute are the ones really representing hip hop and if you look at the amount of good content that comes out by the numbers, hip hops in the best place its ever been in.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small COSMIC WARRIOR I think part of the problem was alluded to in his discussion. Radio is currently playing catchy music regardless of it has any substance behind it. You have to go out of your way to find music with substance. You want music with those aforementioned lyrical features? Check out the new \textbf{Common} album, or the Saba album, or the Tribe album.

The thirties is when you make those dreams happen. But the \textbf{transition} time is hard and a big reality check. Dreams have to be modified as they were ungrounded. This switch is definitely observable say between a 28 yr \textbf{old} and a 31 yr \textbf{old}. The latter will be sadder in most cases, you can actually see this easily in ppl. This short but intense \textbf{transition} point usually involves pain, but is the key that explains why ppl in their 30s feel wiser and when they hear ppl in their 20s rambling, they are disconnected. These are, in a few words, the real source of all these debates between young and \textbf{old} generations. You not an adult until 30.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Good topic about the \textbf{ageism}. As a 25 year \textbf{old}, I find a lot of modern rap or trap music not appealing but I think it's because of my \textbf{age} because when I was in 10th grade, I actually really liked Soulja Boy, crime mob, D4L, dem franchize boys etc. Of course I still liked good quality hip hop and the \textbf{old} school and gems from the 90's too but I liked the more "ignorant" current stuff a lot as well when I was in middle school, 9th and 10th grade. \textbf{Age} has a lot to do with what you like I think. If I was like 5 years younger, I would probably be into the shitty trap shit lol. If you're 23 or older, you're from an older generation and chances are you don't like today's mainstream rap that much.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Ageism, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}5/141 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.546 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small This argument needs to stop. If you don't think rap changed in terms of standards odds are you're a misinformed child. I don't remember whack rappers being in the forefront of hip hop while jay z , nas , and eminem sat in the back. I don't understand how anyone with rap knowledge can disagree. The very fact that people are arguing that "bad music" doesn't exist alone shows how terrible rap has gotten. Lil Yatchy , lil uzi vert, 21 savage , designer , future , young thug, etc. are at the forefront of hip hop, where else even back in 2013, you had kdot push a t (good) drake and more. People KNEW young thug and future were garbage but agreed there's a time and place for it. Now these \textbf{dumb} ass kids will argue that future and thug are actually great and pac reincarnated. These new rappers can't rap , admit they can't rap , say they don't take rap serious , disrespect hip hops history and culture , release the worst music to come out of the genre , don't even consider themselves rappers , yet y'all kids still vouch for them ? The fuck ? If someone can't ball , admits they can't ball, says they don't take balling serious , disrespects basketball , and says they don't consider themselves basketball players , are they still on the team ?

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Myke's argument, that when he was young, he still enjoyed music that wasn't necessarily made for him, has a major flaw. It is flawed because even the Hip-Hop back then had its haters. Hip-Hop in the 80's and 90's had it's own \textbf{old} heads hating on the younger generation's music.

And yes, Outkast, Nas, Jay Z got bashed by \textbf{old} people who didn't have taste for that type of music. People who listen to Trap and Mumble rap have every right to do so. More kids know about Future than Nas, or Lil Yatchy than Talib Kweli. You can't deny that fact. Like I said, take a trip into your local high school and ask them who their favorite artists are.

Rappers have been complaining about the state of hip hop since the 90s: Ice Cube - Turn Off The Radio, \textbf{Common} - I Used to love H.E.R, Wu-Tang Clan - Intro of the 2nd disc of Forever. There has always been a dissonance between what is perceived as aesthetically hip hop and what is portrayed in the mainstream media. This has not gotten worse, just we are starting to romanticise the 90s era, which is implicit of an \textbf{age} gap in Hip Hop and exaggerate the lack of talent in present day hip hop. To Pimp A Butterfly, arguably the most political and lyrical album in the past decade was a massive commercial success, proof that artistry is still celebrated in this era and the "industry machine" can get behind a "true emcee". There will be people ignorant of the culture and the history of the music and this is a shame, but not exclusive to hip hop. Artists that fail to acknowledge the past, will ultimately have a short lived career, there are plenty of young artists that do acknowledge and also include the legends on their albums (Schoolboy Q, Danny Brown, ASAP Rocky., Earl Sweatshirt for example) If 90s era rappers want to remain relevant and educate the youth who are more harder to reach due to their need for instant gratification, they need to show love to artists they genuinely like.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Common & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}2/279 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.717 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Sooftah Generally speaking I do believe hip hop is in a good place right now. There are outstanding young artists out there putting out new sounds with substance but also respect the history of the culture. Kendrick, Nick Grant, Schoolboy Q, J Cole, Joey Badass quickly come to mind. This year you also had \textbf{Common}, Tribe and De La Soul release outstanding albums. You can't ask for much more as a hip hop fan. For a few years I thought the substance in the music was fading but 2016 was an especially strong year and gives me hope for the direction of the genre. One thing I do think that's severely lacking is hip hop groups. There's no more Outkast's, Wu's, Tribe's, there's a lot of crews which individual artists put out projects but not a total group effort. Kanye is an interesting artist because he  bridges the \textbf{old} skool with the new skool. I think Drake is just ok, for the last two years a lot of his music sounds the same. With Nas, Prhyme and Freddie Gibbs w/Madlib hopefully dropping albums in the near future I do think hip hop is in a good space.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small No, music is not worse than it used to be. What's changed is that the radio isn't playing diverse music anymore. All of it has the same topics and sound. To get music that sounds different, you have to go searching online to get it, which a lot of people won't do or don't know how to do.  The problem with hip hop radio is that party/braggadocios music does not \textbf{age} well. Listeners get older, they have other priorities and eventually they just can't relate. Love songs, breakup songs, living life to the fullest songs, etc. relates to a wider range of people.Hip hop is not the only genre dealing with this problem when it comes to the radio, but it's probably the only genre that doesn't have as much diversity as other genres on the radio(as small as that diversity is).\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/143 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.699 \\  \hline

I'd respond with "To Pimp A Butterfly", "12 for 12", "Tetsuo and Youth", "King Push", "I Don't Like Shit, I Don't Go Outside" and "Shyne Coldchain 2". Music goes through ebbs and flows. There are too many artist right now in every genre for anything to take a "huge dive". Rap has struggled with credibility since its inception. There's no point in wasting time worrying about that. Who cares if it doesn't receive credit. That doesn't connect to it's uprise or downfall.Using a basketball team as an example is a stretch because the music pool is so large. It's more like "Sports everywhere doesn't suck. Look at these teams and players over here."In response to your comments about not having to search for music on Youtube or the internet in general because they used to be played on the radio - you kind of pointed out the problem right there: The Radio. Radio controls what the mass audience is hearing. The radio works in trends and that's all. The trend right now is mumble rap and people that want to get famous see how easy it is to do it.The plus side is that the radio is basically Blockbuster and companies like Spotify are Netflix. It's slowly dying and being taken over by another medium. My personal opinion is that there is still great music being made in all genres. It sucks that you have to look for it, but it's out there.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!5}1/298 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.336 \\  \hline

You kids are taking away the weight of the classics and quality music by turning into a second grade basketball "everyone's a winner" atmosphere which is single handily ruining rap. And LMFAO again , that's like getting shot in your arm , and the doctor saying "are you in pain" and you responding "even though my left arm is shot, the rest of my body isn't , so I'm fine" no. The fact that you can't see why speakeboxx and most of the albums you named shouldn't even be said in the same sentence makes It clear that you don't know rap or its history.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I got a problem with the way theyre taking this discussion; the topic shouldn't be \textbf{ageism} because \textbf{age} has \textbf{nothing} to do with the issue, the topic should be the shift in culture or "Culturalism". It's the cultural difference between 90s artists like jayo felony or gang start and current artists like Lil Yachty or 21 Savage that set them apart. Society is different compared to how it was in the 80s and 90s, if Tupac came out in 2013,  he wouldnt be popular in the mainstream line of things, but of course if Tupac dropped All Eyez on Me in 2013 it'd sound a whole lot different then it does now.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Ageism, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!27}3/112 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.679 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Waseem Jaas Definitely. Thats another problem. But that goes with everything. I dont think people have the \textbf{mental} ability to process the art of lyricism anymore. The reason this music is hot is because people are straight up getting stupid. I've had the opportunity to explain the art to many of my friends and they either don't care, or they will just tell me that they don't want to think that much when they listen to music. Its unfortunate. But yeah i see your point and theres definitely more than a few factors that go into what makes this music popular in today's time. Its a tough argument to have as we could just see because what hip hop is now is so developed that to just go back to how it was would be longer than pushing forward to something new. We don't need the \textbf{old} ideas to replace the new. We need new ideas to replace the new. That goes with anything in life.

Even though they both make great phones, sometime other companies make phones just as good as \textbf{Apple}'s and Samsung's but don't get the same recognition because they are not a household name.

You gotta understand that most of these rappers get famous from SoundCloud or YouTube only reason why rappers like lil uzi vert and lil yachty are popular it's because of there fan base another reason why people like them is because they have a different sound from everybody else and there original I wish guys like Bones, Xavier Wulf would as popular them even though they have a really big fan base there music is way different from lil uzi vert and lil yachty at least they can rap better then them lil uzi vert can be more lyrical if he goes back to his \textbf{old} style.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}1/257 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.389 \\  \hline

Yes a song may have a great beat (bumps in the whip) Is this song edifying to you in any other way? If it doesn't make you feel good when listening, or have you making faces at how stupid it is...why do that to yourself?
