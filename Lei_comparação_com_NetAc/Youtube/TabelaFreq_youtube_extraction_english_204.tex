  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I find it vile and appalling that some people, the videographer in this instance, don't seem to understand that in Canada, people have a legal right to privacy yet the man being verbally assaulted seems to think it was his right to stick his nose into another person's business which he should have been smart enough to stay out of. He brought the verbal abuse upon himself yet now he is acting like Mr. Innocent when his interference in another man's business simply begged the white guy to tell him off. The videographer was told before this yelling ever started, to mind his own business and stop filming him. The videographer refused. Charges in this instance would be a travesty of justice but guess what the police just did.........Disgusting!!!!!!! This is Canada and we have laws concerning people's rights, behavior and interaction but most people don't know nor understand those laws and they surely don't respect them. I hope our judges do, but recent history has proven that they don't either as they ignore legislated law and change them to suit what they think rather than substantiating what law states. We are one sick \textbf{nation} of little God wannabees, making up our own rules as we go along and flaunting our long legislated laws as antiquated nonsense.  I wonder why \textbf{nothing} has been said about how this altercation started. It seems the owner of a parking lot decided he had the right to charge for parking and had his employee block this man's truck to get his pound of cash when the abuser was simply using his driveway to turn around on a busy street. In other words, if you step foot on my property, you owe me money. That too is a breach of Canadian law unless there is a obviously visible sign at the entrance stating that "entry constitutes a minimum parking fee".  YouTube seems to be becoming Canada's new legislature for all the little God Wannabees and money worshiping idolaters. If this supposed Asian man was born in Canada, his ignorance of our laws should be grounds for removal of his citizenship.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nation, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/355 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.563 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small In our planetary history, what we have both commonly and highly uncommonly come to recognize as all levels of terrorism is in fact coming from one single ancient and highly unfortunately extremely ancient, highly militant, highly fluid and totally inconceivably resilient culture that has both ruthlessly and relentlessly struggled for global conquest for longer than there is recorded human history.For example, in hemispheres like North America, that basically have no recorded history beyond American \textbf{Indian} hieroglyphs, we, like much of the rest of the world, had never known, heard of, or even remotely conceived of terrorism until we experienced "Huge Influxes of Indians and Pakistanis." And exactly the same is true of the rest of the global populace, with the exception of India, which was divided into India and Pakistan by British Colonists and is in act the true source of totally relentless global terrorism.In direct parallel with all of human history, Indians and Pakistanis are behaving this way because in previous human civilizations, that few of us presently remember, places like Africa, specifically, East Africa, and The Entirety of The Middle East were once \textbf{Indian} Colonies and the Indians and Pakistanis, who are in fact one highly sneaky entity, are covertly warring and using white people (who become highly vicious when they are combined with and inevitably totally controlled and use by Indians and Pakistanis whom they in fact totally unknowingly worship in every way) relentlessly to regain possession of those former colonies in their relentless quest for any form of global conquest.It is extremely important to understand that, the core primary reason that people of \textbf{African} Descent have had totally relentless problems with poverty, prejudice and bad press world wide is because other people of \textbf{African} Descent, whom we \textbf{black} people no longer recognize as people of \textbf{African} Descent (i.e. Indians and Pakistanis who now call themselves Brown People) totally hate us for evicting them from The \textbf{African} Continent numerous times over again; Idi Amin's Uganda being the most recent.One thing in the global history of people of \textbf{African} Descent that is an extremely telling and totally unmistakably ominous pattern is the longevity and precision of the problems of people of \textbf{African} Descent... \textbf{Black} people invariably have problems all over the world with prejudice and poverty, no matter where we go, however, extremely ancient cultures of totally relentless predators know that, people only have problems from themselves and can only be highly precisely tracked and targeted by people who are exactly like themselves... In this case, by Brown People, whom we no longer recognize as \textbf{Black} People.In my research of human geographical history, it has become crystal clear to me that, at some point in human history there was a great ideological divide that occurred among Africans Over Tyrannical, Iron Fisted Control Over Humanity or Total Human Freedom that occurred in The Horn of Africa Region of The \textbf{African} Continent at some point in human history, that still rages on today.Indians and Pakistanis have been expelled from The \textbf{African} Continent many times over again throughout both known and unknown human history and not only do these former Africans want access to The \textbf{African} Continent, they want total control of it, even if it takes Religious Indoctrination, Hyper-industrialization, Media Bashing, Military Invasion (including highly covert \textbf{terrorist} infiltration) or Economic and Technological Hypnotism.In my long ago concluded analysis, Nigeria was chosen because it it is a direct competitor to Kenya, which very conveniently has a Huge Influx of Indians and Pakistanis, just like \textbf{Nazi} Germany and its Ancient \textbf{Indian} Caste System based Class System,  Swastika and Aryan Ideology, Middle Eastern Terrorism, North American Terrorism, Chechnya in Eastern European Terrorism or anywhere else that has experienced historically uncharacteristic flareups of Terrorism.Indians have been able to accomplish this by surviving for multiple human civilizations and creating complete global resets by wiping out the vast majority of humanity in repetitively staged and executed global human Armageddonous resets of human civilizations during which Indians and Pakistanis relentlessly collect as much global human technology, store it in \textbf{Indian} Libraries and re-release it during multiple human civilizations and thereby very successfully making themselves look like a global super \textbf{race}, when in fact they are just thieves.

NO, My grandfather believed that this country needs to be a beacon of hope for those oppressed around the world, a safe haven, a second chance at life and all the rights and freedoms that come from being Canadian + hockey. .this guy is anti Canadian he is the exact opposite of what this country represents.

But there are too many strangers in the country and it is the destruction very slowly but surely of what the canada should be. For example, in canada, i find chinese people are too many. When i was in canada in 2001, it was great. The repartition was correct. Now, chinese people are everywhere. They are buying everything they can. And more and more and more are coming. A lot of refugees or nationalities dont talk english or french. Not at all. It brings communication problems and stress.

Its like a state, in a state. If i want to see indians...chinese, arabs, \textbf{black} or other people, i pay a travel and i go in holidays. The worst is that all government accept them and bring them in the country because"main d'oeuvre" is needed and reproduction. But for me, i prefer 30 000000 people in a country than 38 000000.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small This guy is an idiot but all you un-Canadian trash in the comment saying European families are immigrants. Our Forebears were immigrants here. We are generational Canadians. We built a country here. I'm sorry Native Americans for bringing our diseases, that sucked but no one knew the science of diseases and it wasn't ever intentional, the "blanket giving" myth has been debunked a billion times over by credible historians. Europeans didn't steal your country from you, YOUR FOREBEARS signed treaties with ours in order to set up colonies, there never was one Native American group, they were seperated into tribes, most of which were completely isolated from each other. You can't say that the natives of Haida Gwaii (Queen Charlotte Island) have any claim to Moosekudoboogwek (Nova Scotia) they were completely different tribes with different dialects and different cultural customs, albeit they came from the same genetic stock. Just goes to show what happens when people don't fully educate themselves and they get spoon-fed information their whole lives.All I want is a Canada that takes immigration and borders seriously and for my countrymen to be well educated so we may prosper and overcome our own tragedy, so we may adequately help others overcome theirs. Letting in the whole world doesn't solve any problems, it creates them. People are the problem solvers and we need to have a country that isn't so confusing that no one inside it can understand it. We need to feel like we are part of something bigger than us, not something intangible but something within our grasp, something we can hold onto and say; "this is where I draw the line" my family, my home, my community, my neighbourhood, my city, my province, my \textbf{nation}, these are the things I have within my grasp and these are things that I must hold onto so that my family, my brothers and sisters and countrymen are not beset by the tragedy. The last generation was beset by tragedy, not this one. We learn from the mistakes of forebears and we shoulder the responsibility. I have a country here of generational Canadians, we have Polish and Ukrainian, Native American, French, Scottish, English, Irish, German and Dutch and many other European, Asian and East Asian denominations, if you took the time to go through the properly established methods of obtaining citizenship than you ARE my countrymen, we are a European \textbf{Nation} in our philosophy, we strive to overcome the suffering of life.
