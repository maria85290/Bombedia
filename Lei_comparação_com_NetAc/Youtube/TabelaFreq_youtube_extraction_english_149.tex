  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Hi Danny, very interesting video - I myself am a 48 years \textbf{old} out Irish \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} male, originally from a little village about 20 miles from Dublin (and I also lived in Dublin for 3 years), currently living in Manchester here in the UK since 2002 but I too have been discriminated against from other \textbf{g\textbf{ay}}  men, including on the Dublin \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} scene, even at \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} pride events, where I have found that other \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} men have been my worst bullies to date - I simply gave up trying to interact with any male (\textbf{g\textbf{ay}} or straight) more than 5 years younger than myself, because of the judgemental attitudes that I encountered from other \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} men, even here in Manchester and yet, on my frequent visits home to Ireland, I do not have the same kind of non-acceptance from my family and friends back home that I do from other \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} men, despite the fact that I am also a devout Mass-going Catholic, where my being \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} is fully accepted in my Catholic parish and faith community, both back home in Ireland and here in the UK - in fact, when I go home to Ireland, I visit a group of enclosed Poor Clare Sisters in their Convent in Dublin and in speaking to the Sisters through the grille, they are fully accepting of my being \textbf{g\textbf{ay}}, where they were my late father's former employers, as my extended family and friends have a lot of personal connections to Catholic religious orders and congregations of Priests, Brothers, Monks, Friars and Nuns - when I was growing up, I was always taught about Catholic 'faith and morals' including in relation to my being \textbf{g\textbf{ay}}, but this thing about discrimination and prejudice within the \textbf{L\textbf{G\textbf{BT}}} community is in itself an issue of morality in terms of how we treat other people - how can we possibly champion the rights and equality of and for \textbf{L\textbf{G\textbf{BT}}} people globally when we treat each other so badly, making ourselves look like hypocrites\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gay, LGBT, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Sexual Identity - General, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality, Sexual Identity - Transexuality & \cellcolor{green!5}29/336 & \cellcolor{green!5}8.631 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small ive been treated worse by other \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} men than any other group because my \textbf{age}. i like being 50. we are cool people and we dont have to be accepted. i learned as i got older to not worry about what other \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} men think. irrational behavior is not good for both straight and gays. expecting someone to like you is irrational. should,could, must are irrational words. i dont have any friends, am a \textbf{black} sheep of the family, so i make up my own way of fun and entertainment. dont need others approval. that is the problem for us \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} men. we want society to accept us. most of society dont. i dont let it bother me. i only fight if someone gets in my space and like to cause trouble. i quit being pacifist in that respect because hate is hate and i will not put up with it.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Black, Gay & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Ethnicity - Black, Sexual Identity - General, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality & \cellcolor{green!27}8/151 & \cellcolor{green!27}5.298 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Ageism, among other things, is DEFINITELY an issue amongst \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} men. Yet, in many ways, we only have OURSELVES to blame. We put so much value on being young that we don't embrace the reality that we will grow older, and embrace that reality with respect. For many \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} men, aging has an element of karma. They know how they treated older men in the past, and now they see that they are getting older and realizing that their time in the sun is coming to an end. I, myself, am 38, and I would totally prefer to date or be in relationship with someone my \textbf{age}. However, there are many men who are my \textbf{age} that are dealing with a great deal of emotional damage and fear because of their experiences as being \textbf{g\textbf{ay}}. I fear that we are seeing a vicious cycle with \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} men and aging, among other things. I pray that we find a way to collectively make changes.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Ageism, Gay & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Sexual Identity - General, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality & \cellcolor{green!27}11/163 & \cellcolor{green!27}6.748 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I'm 30 but look a fair bit younger (many people assume I'm about college-\textbf{age}, 22 or so). I'm primarily attracted to younger guys around 18-22 or so and always have been (when I was younger and they were older than me, those were also the ages I liked), but I've begun misrepresenting my \textbf{age} on dating sites lately because people have used my \textbf{age} as a reason not to talk to me. I don't always use such apps for dating either, I'm also looking for friends, and I like to talk about my various interests such as writing, languages, electronic music, and learning about other cultures and perspectives. I also think it's vitally important that younger people have older friends and vice versa, especially in the \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} community, where we sometimes still face a lot of prejudice depending on where you live or what your situation is. We ALL need that kind of support and to come together as equals, regardless of petty little differences like \textbf{age}. We can't afford to exclude one another, in the same way society over the years has excluded us and other people who were different or didn't fit into their box. That doesn't mean you can't have standards or be attracted to the kind of people you are. But at least keep an open mind about friendships and realize that not everyone is out to creep on you or hurt you, and many just want to protect you. As another side of this too however, I just want to point out that some younger \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} men are attracted to older and vice versa as well, and neither party should be ashamed of that. If both parties are consenting and within the boundaries of the law, there's \textbf{nothing} wrong with it and fuck what anyone says.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Gay, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Youngsters, Sexual Identity - General, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality & \cellcolor{green!27}8/301 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.658 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small thank you Danny. I watch a lot of "coming out" videos, primarily because a young \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} guy I knew very well, killed himself after being rejected by his family. I don't ever want to see or hear of that happening again and I pledged after coming home from his funeral that I would do anything in my power to prevent it from happening again. Yes I do get the usual brainless comments now and the from those I'd hope would know better. But the end goal is all that concerns me. if I can help in any small way to stop even one person from taking their life,  I'll happily take all the abuse in the world.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Ageism certainly is real among some that can't imagine themselves one day being in that same demographic. If some of your young viewers comment here about their feelings in what sounds discriminatory towards us it might be helpful for them to not just understand that if they're lucky they too will become members of an aged population but that it would be measurably beneficial for our society as a whole if they were to visit a \textbf{senior} care facility and take note of what really happens as one ages. It's a sad truth that as you live your life having a large social circle in your teens and through to what some may refer to as middle life, that change is in the wind. As each decade there after passes you eventually lose contact with so many that once you knew and even considered to be your "friends" through natural attrition which obviously includes the fate of mortality. Thanks for understanding how one such as myself that has one maybe two and on a stretch three friends at this stage of my life (I'm 59) that at times when I'm alone and search for what is currently happening I find this medium of YouTube to be quite inspirational. Comments made such as this one by myself are for me a way of having a chance to speak freely and hopefully have a virtual connection with others even if I never receive a "Like" ...it, YouTube is an outlet, a way of connecting of understanding and of revisiting our own youthful past.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small As a medical diagnosis, pedophilia, or paedophilia, is defined as a psychiatric disorder in persons who are 16 years of \textbf{age} or older typically characterized by a primary or exclusive \textbf{sexual} interest in PREPUBESCENT CHILDREN (generally those under the \textbf{age} of 14, though onset of puberty varies).

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Youth is beauty; \textbf{age} is wisdom. \textbf{Age} is the wisdom to know just how good you had it when you were young and beautiful. The ignorance of youth is to NOT know how good it is to be young and beautiful; or at least to not fully appreciate it. Because of \textbf{age} discrimination, the only contact older people have with youth culture is through the Internet. So, that is where they go.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I had to watch this video again, I think it is so true and full of good sense. My direct experience is that paedophilia or the suspect of it is not really the issue. The real issue for an older \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} male who still has a lot to give is finding a \textbf{sex} partner. The appeal of youth is unique and irreplaceable and an olderer man has irrecoverably lost it, no matter how interesting, experienced and cultured he may be.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Thank you for such a great video on an excellent topic.I am in my 40's and only found YT in the last year. I participated in a YT contest to be an online boyfriend and was called creepy because of my \textbf{age}. It did hurt because I was only doing it for fun and people began attacking me like I was a peedo. The person holding the contest is in his 20's and had no problem with my \textbf{age}.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I am an older \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} man and I have many much younger friends. They are open minded and appreciate me for who I am and as I am. We tend to reject what we don't understand or do not want to understand. Or what we do not want to see or become. Many younger people think that they know everything and do not want to be reminded that they don't. Seeing someone who has had more life experiences and may actually know more than them is rejected.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Thanks, Danny, for another great and thoughtful video. I am one of your older fans, yes, and I have long had a problem with this \textbf{ageist} attitude. For one, pedophiles prey on pre-teens, so men who find younger men attractive are not pedophiles. I personally find younger guys so much more interesting and yes, more often than not, cute, too. I personally am not all that interested in guys my \textbf{age}, but that doesn't make me a "creeper."

I had said \textbf{nothing} of a \textbf{sexual} nature or inappropriate. He is an awesome singer.  Just because of my \textbf{age}, I got a comment like that and it has happend a few times.
