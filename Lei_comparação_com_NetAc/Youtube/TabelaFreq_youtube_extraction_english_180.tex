  \cellcolor{green!5}\small That's right, get the girls to talk about their future prince charming without encouraging them to rely on their own talent and creativity because it's far more important to be \textbf{sexual} objects with lots of clothes + accessories than to work on self actualising and becoming empowered + independent young women.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small When they were talking about who they want to marry really upset me for some reason. They were talking about how they want to marry a rich man, and all that.. and they will probably grow up still thinking like that. So that means if they see someone not as rich as they would like them to be, they are not even going to look at them, speak to them, or even notice they're even there. If they see a rich, handsome man they will go for him, and say they "love" him, and he will say the same because they are pretty, and rich like himself. The thing is.. what about that poor guy you never even looked at? He turned out to be the nicest person in the whole world, who was sweet, kind, incredible, friendly, and respectful, and still lacking money. But this rich guy... he had a big house, a fast car, posh clothes, but guess what. That is the person that will one day break your heart. He is unkind, disrespectful, and only wants you for the glamour and fun, not for love.I'm not saying every rich/poor person is like this, but I just want to make a point that the stuff on the OUTSIDE, shows \textbf{nothing} on the inside. And the inside is the most important.

I don't know what kind of upbringing these kids parents had, but raising a child solely for the intention for them to be rich and famous us something I absolutely don't believe in. So, in conclusion, I firmly believe that this is not well thought-out style of parenting, these kids won't have had happy childhoods and teenage years, and they may develop \textbf{mental} illness due to missing out on key moments and having a childhood where they were oversexualised and taught to act older than their \textbf{age}.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Mental & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}3/155 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.935 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I really wonder how much of their sense of self worth is internal.  At that \textbf{age} and into their teens, girls are very self conscious and kids tease eachother a lot and so parents then generally teach their children that they don't have to always put on a face for their peers or the world who might tease them for not fitting some criteria, (most certainly not paparazzi). Also,  the girl has dreams for her life to be an A list celeb (it's great that she's dreaming about her future) it's also okay if she wants a rich husband,  but her reason for that is for someone to look after her. Generally children her \textbf{age} raised with true confidence look forward to being totally independent, they'll fantasize about  all the things they'll hab e as an adult and imagine themselves being the enablers of their fantasy. I just feel that a disproportionate amount of their identity comes from outside at a stage in a child's life where they are establishing their own identity. It appears that they have an over reliance on external validation, thats not  healthy for building self esteem. Poor kids and they are such sweet hearts, ah (nice shoes and clothes = nice person)?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small You are brainwashed by society as well if you think a certain way of life is better than another. Everybody has their life to do with as they want, in their teens they'll figure this out, and once they are adults they do what they want, and choose to continue being fashionable and snobby or whatever this is supposed to be or go a completely different direction. Would be interesting to see how they are doing now as this docu is quite \textbf{old}.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}1/83 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.205 \\  \hline
