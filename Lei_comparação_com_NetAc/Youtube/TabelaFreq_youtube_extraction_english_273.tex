  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Any disgusting little sand flea whore who sucks and fucks her brother and shits out children that he impregnates her with and ends up having a bunch of little retarded moronic children really isn't a big deal.

He was a pedophile little boy raping little boy dick sucking pillow biting pantywaist \textbf{faggot} of a prophet. Just like every man in the Muslim faith they all suck cock and take it up the ass. So being that Ilhan Omar is letting her brother impregnate her and shitting out his children isn't that bad when you look at how disgustingly sick the prophet Muhammad was. and if Rashida tlaib and ilhan Omar could suck Satan's cock their self they would in a heartbeat so would every man of the Muslim religion they love sucking cock just like every \textbf{faggot} at CNN and MSNBC\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Faggot & \cellcolor{green!27}Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality & \cellcolor{green!27}2/209 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.957 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small It is shocking and disgusting some of the comments that the Trump trolls are making here. No one in Congress had the guts to stand up to the criminally insane and tyrannical government of Israel except one \textbf{woman}... A Somalian \textbf{refugee} who came to America for a better life for herself and her family and now is braver than any native-born member of Congress in standing up to basically the government of Israel which is \textbf{nothing} but window dressing for the Illuminati which in case anybody doesn't know or just the world bankers who own and control the rest of us... Kudos to Omar and Talib they are more patriotic and believe in our constitution then 95 of the Kool-Aid drinking, illiterate and dysfunctional morons that the CIA counts on to continue its control over all of us! Go ahead and take your best shot at me guys...because a thousand of you couldn't muster enough courage or brain cells to bring Homer Simpson or Archie Bunker back to life... what is really sad is when she stands up for the Palestinians she is actually standing up for everybody including all you dumbasses who blindly follow Trump's \textbf{racist} tweets and his divide-and-conquer strategy basically counting on Americans turning against each other while they continue to pick all our pockets. Just think about this people... the Israeli government runs a 10 billion dollar a year Surplus and we have given them in the last couple years 150 billion dollars in foreign aid. What do you think we could have done in this country with that 150 billion dollars...? I will tell you a couple of things we could have done with that money: we could have completely paid off all student debt and had tens of billions of dollars for massive infrastructure programs as well as funds for health care and education and still had money left over... just like Tulsi gabbard talks about in many of her speeches if we take the money from regime-change Wars which is a lot of the Israeli foreign aid goes to believe it or not then we would have all the money we need to take care of our own people without raising a single penny and taxes here but creating trillions of dollars of New Wealth by investing in our people. All you guys know deep down inside that I am right you are just somehow so infatuated with this moron in the White House and I'm sorry he is a moron and very manipulative human being all he worships is the almighty dollar and he will use anybody S and ends to his means to line his own pockets and take care of the people who bailed him out for decades from all his financial stupidity but he's not that stupid because he was able to get in the White House and basically create an even bigger Network for his criminal Enterprise he is no better than the clintons or the bushes they are all the same pimping the system to take care of themselves and their cronies we do not have a two party system in this country we have a two-class system here the oligarchy and the rest of us who are financially enslaved to them with a few exceptions... I posted a few videos demonstrating the war crimes of the Israeli government right now and even how our own country participates and gives Israel whatever it wants including changing laws in our own country which puts the Israeli government above our own citizens and if you think things are bad now... Give it some more time and it will be much worse if Netanyahu and his Rothschild Mafia have things their way right here in the USA... the Israeli government does not need a two-state solution... They already have a 50 state solution... think about that...that's really fucked up isn't it...? If you guys never have seen this video before there are many like it but mr. Grant really does a great job in explaining what's really going on and the history of it if you haven't seen this before or understand anything about what Israel has done behind the scenes to our own government you are going to be very shocked and incredibly freaking pissed off... especially some of you Trump supporters because Trump blindly follows Netanyahu around like a little puppy dog because Trump basically is controlled by this group of people in after you watch this entire video you're going to look at everything a little bit differently and you'll realize why Trump moved our Embassy for Netanyahu and also Trump recognizing the Golan Heights is being Israeli Sovereign territory against all International laws and decency and after you watch the first video then you will be prepared to see the second one because it will make a whole lot more sense and especially if you are a veteran and never knew this because your government tries to keep this from you then you will be so angry you probably won't sleep too good for a while especially you vets but I digress and I will let the following two videos speak for them self instead of wasting time spoiling hatred on all these threads just sit there and watch these two documentaries and I will guarantee you if you really are a patriotic American who loves his country you will never be the same after watching both of these documentaries and please come back and let me know what you think after watching these two documentaries I would appreciate the feedback and see what people think and feel when they have never known the truth about these things or probably never knew about them at all...

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Ya know....when President Jimmy Carter wrote about The Balfour Declaration of November, 1917 which led to the re-establishment of Israel in 1948 that Baron Lionel Walter Rothschild signed as mentioned as well through The Encyclopedia Britannica, did anyone question where a Jewish Rothschild Banker that uses the term, 'Baron' in front of his name comes from, because the first person I thought about was "The \textbf{R\textbf{ed}} Baron" from WWI. I had to know where they come from.Of course, Lord Baron Jacob Rothschild gave an interview on YouTube about his family's involvement in restoring Israel in Palestine due to Baron Lionel Walter Rothschild who signed The Balfour Declaration of November, 1917. Of course, Baron Jacob Rothschild was a Lord in The House of Lords.Did you know that it was mentioned in The Jewish Encyclopedia published in 1906, Vol. 10, pp. 490 that Mayer Amschel Rothschild was an agent of Prince William Landgrave IX of Hesse Cassel (sometimes spelled with a "K") who funded British Troops against The American Revolution? Of course, it was also mentioned in The Journals of The House of Commons published in 1803 by The Parliament of Great Britain that Prince William Landgrave IX of Hesse Kassel married Princess Mary, the daughter of King George II from Great Britain. There are also other sources on Prince William Landgrave IX of Hesse Kassel who married Princess Mary. Through History \textbf{Dot} Com, they mentioned The Royal Marriage Act of 1772 which led to Queen Victoria's Matchmaking of her nine chilldren's 42 grand children - quote: "Eventually, seven of them sat on European thrones in Russia, Greece, Romania, Britain, Germany, Spain and Norway—and all would take sides during World War I with disastrous consequences."The Rothschild Banking Barons worked their un-welcomed way back into The United States through August Belmont, and they even mention August Belmont on The Rothschild Foundation's Website. I believe that was around the time that President Andrew Jackson stood against The Rothschild Bankers after taking over President John Quincy Adam's Anti Mason Party formed in the early 1800s after Capt. William Morgan was murdered at Lake Ontario after writing the book, "Illustrations of Freemasonry." Capt. William Morgan's Tombstone at his Memorial also mentions in stone that he was killed by Freemasons. August Belmont also promoted Salmon P. Chase according to books written in the 1800s, and Salmon P. Chase became upset over the accusations made against Simon Wolf, \textbf{Abe} Lincoln's Jewish Attorney who was threatened with arrest by a U.S. Colonel Baker from The U.S. War Department for espionage. Simon Wolf was supposedly caught trading with Southern Jews during The Civil War. Mr. Wolf also wrote a book proclaiming his innocence titled, "Presidents I Have Known 1860 - 1918," and The Jewish Historical Society of Greater Washington wrote about Simon Wolf as well who was also a spokesman for B'nai B'rith formed in October of 1843 \& a member of The Washington Congregation of Hebrews. Of course, there are also books from the 1800s talking about Simon Wolf and The Rothschild Banking Barons. Simon Wolf was impressed by The Rothschild's mansions and castles, and The Rothschild Bankers did deal in Slavery through The Freshfield Family out of London. Of course, Colonel Taylor worked with \textbf{Abe} Lincoln to come out with "Greenbacks" at "No Interest" which could have been seen as impeding on The Rothschild's business affairs. Of course, George Peabody received huge loans from British Bankers after The Civil War ended before working with Julius Spencer Morgan to form J.P. Morgan \& Company known today as J.P. Morgan \& Chase, and The Biography Channel also mentioned those British Loans through their documentary on J.P. Morgan. Of course, Glen Beck was fired after mentioning The Rothschild Bankers after interviewing G. Edward Griffin about his book, "The Creature From Jekyll Island," which is about when The Rothschild, Rockefeller, Morgan, Warburg, and Chase Bankers met on Jekyll Island in 1910 to discuss the creation of our Private Central Bank called our Federal Reserve Bank. Of course, The Federal Reserve Act was signed on December 23rd, 1913, two days before Christmas, two months after The (ADL) Anti Defamation League was formed, and one year before WWI broke out.Of course, people forget about Canada's History on when The British controlled Upper Canada after The Battle of Quebec in 1759 and The Treaty of Paris in 1763-1783. There was also The War of 1812 when The British burned down The White House, and The Aroostook War 1838-9 in Aroostook County, Maine which was a border skirmish/dispute between The British and The United States. Of course, even through The Encyclopedia Britannica, The Canadian Monarchy is known as The British Monarchy. The Bank of Canada is a Crown Corporation controlled by The Crown of Canada, and The Queen of England sits on The Crown of Canada. Rent Subsidies from Crown Land in Canada still goes to The Crown of Canada. Of course, Crown Land is Public Land in Canada, and The Queen of England is all supposed to be symbolic. Canada also still has a Privy Council just like Great Britain. Ireland got rid of their Privy Council in 1933 due to The British meddling into their political affairs after Ireland gained their sovereignty from The British. Of course, who looks into ties between The Rothschild \& Sons Company in Canada (large shares in TD Trust) and The Queen of England?Of course, England did join Scotland to form Great Britain in 1707. In 1901, Great Britain did join Northern Ireland to form The United Kingdom. The United Kingdom later joined Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, \& Sweden to form The European Union. 28 countries in all. I find all that rather interesting and questionable. I believe everyone else should question all that as well. Of course, France fought The British in many battles before The Napoleon Wars. No more battles between France and The British followed The Battle of Waterloo that U.S. General Mark Milley, today, likes telling his cadets to remember at The ROTC at Norwich University while he talks about 'Little Green Men." 12 years after The Battle of Waterloo, France \& Britain became allies at The Battle of Navarino, or was that all due to Mayer Amschel Rothschild's son, Nathaniel Rothschild, who connived his way into winning the bid on the loan for The Reparations of France after The Battle of Waterloo with Napoleon as depicted in that 20th Century Fox Movie from 1934 called "The House of Rothschild?"  Of course, I could mention other things I question involving cover ups, and I'm a direct descendant of Reverend George Wightman (Baptist Encyclopedia), brother of Reverend Valentine Wightman (Baptist Encyclopedia) who married Susannah Holmes, the great grand daughter of Roger Williams (Encyclopedia - The Founder of Rhode Island in 1636). Of course, Roger Williams was a Puritan, and The Mayflower came in 1620 with a boat load of Puritans after The First British Colony was established in 1607 in Jamestown, Virginia after Capt. John Cabot discovered North America after reaching the shores of Newfoundland in 1498.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Abe, Dot, Red & \cellcolor{green!5} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Ethnicity - Asian (South- India, Pakistan, Bangladesh), Ethnicity - Native-American, Religious Identity - Jewish & \cellcolor{green!5}5/1201 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.416 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Octavio Dominguez israel making peace with Palestine? Listen im not jewish and im not palestinian. From news reports from every outlet you can think of sticking up for both sides and criticizing both sides ive come to the conclusion that Israel is opressing the Palestinian people and trying to take as much as they can with illegal settlements and using its power to not find ways to come to a 2 state peaceful solution. There have been individuals on both sides who have tried but they get assassinated. Im not condoning anyone who says death to Israel and wishing they were wiped off the earth just like i dont condone the very blatant mistreatment of Palestinians by Israeli soldiers. Ive seen cruel things done by those soldiers. The statement i was referring to that Rep Omar said was the very huge israeli lobbyist group giving huge money to American politicians to get things passed in their favor. This statement is true. Israel and many other lobbyists pump money into the American political system so much so that the system has become corrupted.   I have not heard Omar say she supports a boycott of Israel or that she supports islamic countries that want to kill anyone that doesnt agree with their views. Im reacting to her statement about republicans supporting Israel because of huge money given to them by Israeli lobbyists. This is true. Only one being boycotted is Omar by Israel  baning her from entering Israel. That doesnt sound like democracy to me. What i dont like is that any criticism of the Israeli government and their policies or disagreeing with Netanyahu in any way is met with you being called an antisemite. That is bullshit. Im not saying all palestinians are doing the right things but to me America especially with Trump in the White house is favoring one side way over the other. I know..your shouting israel is our one and only democratic ally in the middle east right? Well they are not treating palestinians very democratically. My friend in my eyes watching those walls and fenced in check points set up by Israel and how the Israeli soldiers are treating the palestinian people i see resemblances of how the \textbf{nazi} gustapo treated jews back in the 1930's and the 1940's. Rep Omar is a democratically elected congressman. I want to say if you dont like it you can leave this country but that would be stooping to Trumps level so i wont say you or anyone should do that. In a true democracy the statement love it or leave it is said by idiots who usually are \textbf{racist} narcissistic and dont know what democracy is.

Reddit was used many times as a source prior that happening. Of course, \textbf{nobody} questions things like the fact that Israel's Demographics show that the population of Christians living in Israel is only 2 according to The Pew Research Center, The CIA, and The Population Reference Bureau. Who is anti-what again? Of course, Baroness Tonge was censored in European Parliament over Israel's War Crimes against Palestinians back in 2009, and U.S. Congressman Paul Findley from Illinois was censored over what takes place in Israel long before that.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Kevin Healey Oh...I'm a direct descendant of Reverend George Wightman (Baptist Encyclopedia), brother of Reverend Valentine Wightman (Baptist Encyclopedia) who married Susannah Holmes, daughter of Mary Holmes, daughter of Mary Sayles, daughter of Roger Williams (Encyclopedia- Founder of Rhode Island \& Founder of The 1st Baptist Church in North America). Susannah Holmes was also the grand daughter of Obediah Holmes (Encyclopedia) whom \textbf{Abe} Lincoln falls under except \textbf{Abe} Lincoln fell under Sarah Bowne, Susannah's 1st cousin. Reverend George Wightman's son, Reverend John Wightman who married Jane Bentley, was the father of Mary Wightman who married Capt. Samuel Boone Jr.. Capt. Samuel Boone Jr. was elected as a Captain through The North Kingstown Company before The American Revolution broke out. At the \textbf{age} of 59, Capt. Samuel Boone Jr. refused to allow his sons to join The American Revolution. General William West was responsible for weeding out Loyalists in the state of Rhode Island before the war broke out. I believe he was responsible for stripping Capt. Samuel Boone Jr. of his title, place of birth, and 600 acre lot of land in Exeter, Rhode Island before Capt. Samuel Boone Jr. fled to Canada along with 50,000 to 70,000 other Loyalists. His siblings and sibling's wives also left with him. Of course, Capt. Samuel Boone Jr. was buried in Lancaster, NB while his wife, Mary Wightman, remained behind and died on The Boone Lot next to Boone Lake never to see her husband or children ever again. Afraid for their kids lives they were. Of course, The Boone name was long ago known as 'de Bohun' according to The Boone Society, so I guess that makes me a descendant of The British Royals as well. Of course, so was Daniel Boone who did join a militia in The American Revolution. Humphrey De Bohun (Encyclopedia) had his head split in two by Robert The Bruce after William Wallace fought against King Edward The 1st. Yeah...I'm a descendant of The British Royals just like The Queen of England. Of course, I'm not rich like they are, and I grew up believing in what our U.S. Founding Fathers set out to create, so I guess that means I'm not a Loyalist like my direct ancestor was. Of course, I have other ancestors who did fight in The American Revolution. Of course, there is a lot of lineage in a person's family tree, and you all need to ask, "Who is a Loyalist and who is not?" That is the only way you'll ever solve this whole mess we're all living in.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Abe, Age & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Religious Identity - Jewish & \cellcolor{green!5}3/427 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.703 \\  \hline

The dissolution of oaths is with pagans who remained at Mecca following its capture. They did \textbf{nothing} wrong, but were evicted anyway.

If Allah is supremely deceitful toward unbelievers, then there is little basis for denying that Muslims are allowed to do the same.

However, to stay silent when Israel's snipers aim at medics during demonstrations has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt by many external investigations and I have watched and seen the results of the line of fire.  We have to speak out and demand that the one or ones who gave the order, or if it was the sniper's own choice of target, we need to see some sort of punishment or at the very least an acknowledgement of fault. When you fire at medics the goal is to increase casualties because no one with any skill is there to aid the fallen. I have supported Israel through thick and \textbf{thin} over the years but with the emergence of new violent hardliners who want to create a country for Jews alone when they have a significant number of peaceful Muslims living among them is worrisome.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small So, she critisized massive contributions by a lobby to the Republican party. Ok, so, it is an American Jewish lobby. This does not mean she is an out and out anti semite. I would say the implications of her tweets are in poor taste, that they may inadvertently reinforce antisemitic tropes, but to throw antisemitism as a charge against her personally is very serious.One question I have for my fellow Democrats though is this. What in the fuck  did you expect to happen in this situation?Our 1st Muslim congresswoman makes a comment about a Jewish lobby, off course there is going to be outrage and misunderstanding from every freaking angle. 80 of Evangelicals (of all different ethnicities) voted for President Trump. These are Republican Christians. It does not take a damn rocket scientist to understand that such people would be pro Israel.Christians also struggle with antisemitic tropes because of certain texts, streams of tradition, and history, from within their own movement. There are many and diverse facets of Christian identity  which tie themselves to that tiny patch of land in the middle east as a matter of identity. On the flip side, Is Rep. Omar supposed to supress any opinion she may hold due to her cultural frame of reference, her upbringing, her faith, her experienxes, the contentious relationship of recent times between Jews and Muslims? I mean, who is suprised? \textbf{Nobody} who pays attention.I mean, the Democratic party always talks about horrors of white privilege, toxic masculinity, and bigotry, and lauds wanting to embrace diversity, tolerance, and diverse views, and ways of life, but now you are stuck in a quagmire around the very thing you say you cherish because in this situation, you will have views that are mutually exclusive, that talk past one another.You cannot please everyone of every background, \textbf{ethnicity}, orientation, and perspective, especially when there are fundamental divisions in identity and perspective THAT ARE KNOWN to everyone. You cant expect Jewish Americans to be happy about Omar's statements, but you are suprised she made them, or surprised at the reaction of Islamic communities?This is the problem with hinging things on identity rather than policy.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity, Nobody & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/365 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.548 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small If we define anti semitisim as literally any criticism of Israel at all then it is indeed a usefull diplomatic tool unavailable to the majority of \textbf{nation} states. If Israel can effectively exclude non jews from citizenship (which it does) and prioritize white European jews in selecting potential immigrants (which it does) then criticism of the state, of Zionism or of any aspect of the Israeli government is by definition anti semitic. It is in effect an ethnostate and 'theo-state' (yeah, there's probably an actual word for that, but I haven't got a thesaurus) with an inbuilt defence against external critique. So 'what's her name' basically said that the US only supports Israel because of political donations. Well... so? The whole US political system (and most other outwardly democratic systems around the world) run on political donations. Pointing out that all our favourite political parties are essentially hoars for cash and uncritical coverage is not a cogent argument, especially if you are a registered member of one of the two worst offenders. Neither is it criticism of the state of Israel or jews individually or in plurality. Not actually anti semitic. If white supremacists finally establish their ethnostate they should take a leaf from Israel's book. Criticism of the white government would then be simply a case of \textbf{racism} against the master \textbf{race}. Don't like Australian immigration policy? Anti antipodean. Don't like French trade policy? Anti Mime wearing a beret and eating baguette. Upset with British foreign policy? Anti person who says sorry a lot and likes drinking tea. Uggh.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Thisnational discussion over Omar's anti-Semitic remarks didn't result in hercondemnation by the House. To the contrary, the House majority revealed itselfto be deeply divided on the question of how to handle blatant anti-Semitism.Omar has said far worse things in the past, but she gets a free pass from theDems and the news media and Twitter. Instead the Democratic party focuses ondefending Jihadists and their calls to wipe Israeloff the map. Omar came here as a \textbf{refugee} from Mogadishuin 1995 and now wants to tell all Americans how the Country should think andlook like. How did a she get elected, marrying her brother to allow him to bein the states. BillClinton's legacy: In the mid-1990s, the U.S.State Department began bringing large numbers of Somali nationals to Minnesota,assigning them \textbf{refugee} status due to the civil war and general violence andpoverty which still grips Somaliatoday.By the endof 2010, the U.S.had admitted 83,991 Somali nationals, with roughly 40 percent of them initiallysettling in Minnesota.Many more have since been allowed to immigrate legally, and many others haveentered the country illegally as well.Of course, there is also a large concentration of these refugees in Maineas well, and like Minnesota,it's not the frigid temperatures that makes the state so attractive, but itsextraordinarily generous welfare programs( Socialism ).What has been the result of this massive relocation of Somalis? In 2018(267,703) voters in Minnesota District 5 voted a Somali Muslim Socialist, IlhanOmar, into the U.S.House of Representatives! BIG MISTAKE...Thanks to Bill ClintonIlhan Omarstated that she should not be expected to "pledge allegiance/support for aforeign country," but does pledge allegiance to the Council on AmericanIslamic Relations, which funded her congressional campaign and was found tohave ties to Hamas. The'compromise' Democrats finally agreed upon was a resolution that not onlylumped in the question of the moment — the effort by one member of Congress todelegitimize Jews and supporters of Israel— with a laundry list of other hatreds. And they failed to single out Omar forher actions. BIG MISTAKE ! It was adisgrace display of Democrat partisanship that we saw yesterday byDemocrats  passing legislation to condemnhate. Americans already condemn hate.  They don'tneed legislation to tell them that. What is at hand is anti-semitism.  Denouncinganti-Semitism especially when it's coming from a congresswomen. But in adespicable display of partisanship, and to avoid ongoing embarrassment of theparty, Democrats decided to address the issue by attempting to pass ananti-Semitism bill (one that directly names the congresswomen) but instead ofdoing so, Democrats decided to pass an anti-hate bill. A bill to include hateof any kind.Most see it as an attempt by Democrats to deflect blame away from the Congresswomen's controversial tropes against Israel(as Democrats call them) to a sweeping bill to condemn all type of hate.Instead of condemning the congresswomen and holding her accountable, Democratsdecided to pass an anti-bigotry bill.Thebeginning of the end for Omar....That this exercise was blatantly insincere wasevident not only from the wording of the apology but also because of Omar's opensupport of the BDS — boycott, divestment, sanctions — movement against Israelwhich routinely traffics in anti-Semitism Since themass immigration some 100 years ago, Jews have become richest religious groupin American society.

How did it happen, and howcrucial is their aid to Israel?Jews in all centers of powerLauder isdefinitely not the only American Jew funneling money to Israelwhile influencing the country. Many Israeli adults used to receive a parcelfrom "the rich uncle in America"during their childhood. Thousands of organizations, including hospitals anduniversities, receive billions of shekels in donations from the US.A Hebrew Universitystudy found that they make up about two-third of all donations in Israel. Some 5.6million Jews live in the United States(not including half a million Israelis) – about 2 of the population. Most ofthem reside in rich cities: Miami,Los Angeles, Philadelphiaand Boston, andmainly New York. A recentstudy from 2008 found that Jews are the richest religious group in the US:Forty-six percent of Jews earn more than \$300,000 a year, compared to 15 amongall Americans. Another Galluppoll conducted this year found that 75 of American Jews enjoy "a highstandard of living" compared to 50 of the population and more than anyother religious group.  More than200 of the 400 billionaires on Forbes' list of the wealthiest people in Americaare Jews. Seven of the 20 leading venture capital funds in the USbelong to Jews, according to Forbes. Googlefounder Sergey Brin has a Jewish father, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg isJewish, as is his deputy, David Fischer, the son of Bank of IsraelGovernor Stanley Fischer.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Erzsi Rodgers Oh Erzsi! I couldn't agree more. Comparative theology is so interesting. But I've moved on somewhat. As your witty post relates, the idea that someone could actually think that one of the three Abrehamic faiths rejects the \textbf{Old} Testament is both hilariously ignorant and hipocritical in the extreeme.The \textbf{Quran} says that the Torah, the Psalms and the Gospels as being revealed by God to the prophets Moses, David and Jesus. Like jews, they just don't like the christian copy of the same story! Its a bit like three farmers arguing about who's pig will graduate college first. Since the Protestant, Eastern Orthadox and Catholic bibles are all similarly in conflict it seems just a little academic. Muslims do at least treat Jesus as a prophet... much more generous than jewdaisim who consider him an abomination. I was especially amused by your pun regarding belief... that a modern christian has actually read the \textbf{old} testament is not just unlikely but also a prerequisite for maintaining any regard for its value. The idea of placing any value on what is basically a bronze \textbf{age} witchcraft manual would be amusing were it not so utterly sick. Being an observer to the clash between faiths is only mildly entertaining... after all, one can only watch 3 monkeys sling faeces at eachother for so long, and 2000 years is perhaps long enough. Like me, I imagine you have mixed feelings regarding the inevitable fate of the church. The child rape conviction of the 3rd most \textbf{senior} cardinal in the entire catholic church marks a new low on the descent of that institution... seminaries are empty and unable to replace this soon to retire generation of priests and the vocation of 'nun' is close to becoming non existent. Anglican congregations are fatally split and in decline. The loss of these traditional denominations is culturally regrettable but disasterous in the light of their replacement by business driven mega churches, McChurches if you will, an extension of morally corrupt TV evangelicals and sham clerics. It was inevitable that bystanders would eventually tire of the monkeys and their stool slinging, the spectacle no longer worth being spattered with filth. After all, we now have "Game of Thrones". The \textbf{old} testament was a little too perverted for mass consumption anyway. Perhaps we all should believe in G.O.T instead? Seems a little more credible.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Old, Quran, Senior & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Religious Identity - Muslim & \cellcolor{green!5}6/395 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.519 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Omar, along with AOC and Tailb Rashida have proven to be a blessing for Donald Trump and the Republican Party. Their most invaluable contributions thus far have been:Omar: Her profound, hearfelt and recalcitrant anti-semitism, which she has expressed openly and repeatedly. If she could contribute to the destruction of Israel I'm certain she would.AOC: In her Opus Magnum, the "Green Dream", which can be summarized as a series on outlandish, nonsensical statements, she has put in display for all to see her profound and vast ignorance not only of the planet and environmental sciences but also of economy and geopolitics. Her "Green Dream" has becoming the de facto "Manifesto" of the Democrat Party. Rashid: Her sentiments are not too different than those of Omar.

Auntie Maxine's apparently gets paid to do \textbf{nothing} but utter one word incessantly: "Impeach!" Only in Washington one can get rich with a job like that!Kamal Harris Her advocacy to legalize pot and prostitution, speaks volumes of her moral compass.

I agree, more Americans do need to travel abroad. My point is that more Americans also need to travel the US. I suggest that you do that too. Travel by car, and depending on how you sound and what you look like you'll see both the beauty and ugliness of the US. I've traveled both and have experienced both. It has been a blessing to do so considering that many can't afford to and I will be the first to say that the US has gotten many things right - but it still does many things badly and it is our duty as citizens to try to achieve that dream we all want as citizens.

This is feeling-based "thinking," and not practical. It will ruin the finances of America, as the crap-filled streets of California.Ilhan Omar represents the Democrats as CNN represents the mainstream media. Both represent "diversity" -- however anti-American a person is -- and an open call for population replacement in America.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small There is plenty about the Democrats to criticize but I don't believe that any criticism of Israel is necessarily anti-semitic.  You could point out that Jewish Americans are represented in certain well-compensated and desirable professions many times over the proportion of their numbers in society.  Is it anti-semitic to allude to this situation simply because it might be embarrassing to many Jewish Americans who have realized the benefits?  Something like a third of the richest Americans are Jewish while they comprise a mere 2 of our population. Is pointing out this peculiar situation engaging in anti-semitic speech?  I obtained those figures from an article written many years ago by a Jewish author who was bragging about how superior he thought Jews were to the rest of us and used such details to bolster his argument, which I considered Jewish bigotry.  Shifting to \textbf{black} people, only ten percent of the population, who now have an outsized influence on our culture due primarily to fifty years of Affirmative Action policies.  Most boxers, 90 of professional basketball players, and far more than 50 of football players are \textbf{black}.  Perhaps they are better athletes than their white counterparts, perhaps the realities of economics makes them more driven to succeed in an area now wide open to them, yet those issues don't readily explain or account for such a skewed reality.  I'll give you one that next to \textbf{nobody} ever states:  Why is it wrong for a man to want to have \textbf{sex} with a \textbf{woman}  when she doesn't want \textbf{sex} with him, pushing the situation widely considered attempted rape, yet when a \textbf{woman} wants to have \textbf{sex} with a man and he does not want to have \textbf{sex} with her, he obviously suffers from "performance issues" or must be \textbf{g\textbf{ay}}?  How many times have you heard in the media that a man must "perform" in several ways in order to satisfy a \textbf{woman}, yet her "performance" is never discussed at all?   All she has to do is lie there, I guess.   By the way, why are white men excluded from Affirmative Action set asides while everyone  else has benefited from them  for decades?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@suijurispeacemaker  Let's dissect your argument, shall we?1- "It's all about the Benjamins" is a very smart sentence with 3 different layers of meanings, and it is far smarter than some of the "humorous" remarks and comments that most American politicians make. In her sentence, the Benjamins refer to both \$\$ and Benjamin Netenyahu, both of which are very related to her argument regarding AIPAC and how they're buying off politicians. On the very surface, the sentence has a cultural appeal and grabs attention because of its relation to the rap song. This is called smart commenting, and in an \textbf{age} where millennials are the future, she's using the language that appeals to them instead of using the same \textbf{old} boring, less meaningful, deceitful, and misleading language that most politicians use.2- If you want to learn about why she supports BDS, you can search it to find an answer. She's in no way obliged to tackle all aspects of her argument based on a series of back and forth tweets that smear her and label her as anti-Semitic. She's a smart lady, and she knows that the best audience to target are intellectuals; those are people who are willing to seek the truth on their own without anyone else shoving "the truth" down their throats (which is what the mainstream media does and wants for all people).3- When you have a corrupt government that is fucking up every aspect of the American society, who lies so blatantly, and that has been proven wrong on so many different occasions in the past 20 years, the people in this government lose their credibility. Their opinions about who's right and who's wrong becomes obsolete. It's like letting a murderer be the judge of someone else's trial who's being accused of committing the murderer's crime. Besides, your politicians criticize each other left and right all the time, why doesn't it mean anything except when you want it to mean something? This is called cherry-picking in an argument. It's an \textbf{old} and very misleading and misguiding technique, and it only works on people who aren't smart or who lack any will to put some effort into learning the truth.4- Should I even comment on her using the congress as a social media? You argue that she fucked up because Trump said so. Trump...TRUMP! Have you even seen his Twitter account and how he uses it? Again, you're cherry-picking. You're smearing her for using social media, but you trust the opinion of your president, who uses social media more than any other politician in the history of America!5- You're saying she's putting Islam first and that she's not doing anything to bring Americans together. Can you back this up with ANY facts or evidence? Because I can easily say the same about literally any other politician, and it wouldn't mean shit without any evidence. You can say that it's your opinion that she's doing that, but you can't state it as a fact without evidence. This is what the mainstream media does, so I don't blame you for being brainwashed to think it's an acceptable argument technique. But, in reality, it is not, and it means \textbf{nothing} but a fictional sentence as far as I'm concerned.I would appreciate a thorough answer and a constructive argument without misleading and deceitful techniques, if you don't mind, and if you intend to reply :)Thank you.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Nothing, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}4/572 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.699 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@suijurispeacemaker But the thing about US politics is that it affects people all around the world, as well as the American people, and the only way to make any changes in that is by being a part of these politics in order to change them.You say she should speak about America and its people, but that is what she's doing. Here are two ways to look at it:1- She's talking about AIPAC, which is a US based Israeli lobby that does, in fact, affect America and its people by influencing and controlling the policies that govern them.2- When she talks about foreign policies, she's also talking about something that drastically affects America and its people. America's foreign policies have two very major negative effects on its all Americans:A) The regime change wars that the US is committing against countries in the Middle East and in Latin America are effectively increasing the number of people around the world who hate America, who can in turn become terrorists, and who might then attack Americans in the US or in other countries around the world. The US has \textbf{nothing} to do with other countries' politics or regimes, and it has no place in policing them, especially when Americans don't want people from other countries being part of their government or affecting their policies. This is called sovereignty, and the US government should respect it in other countries as it wants other countries to respect it for them.B) The American government spends more on military than the other top 9 countries in the world, and for what? To change regimes in other countries and increase the amount of aggression that others have towards the US? This is severely counter-productive when you think in terms of National Security, so it's logical to think that there's an agenda behind it (war is a very profitable industry, and the biggest profiteers are the same people who pay millions of dollars to US politicians to sway their opinions and affect their policies, but that's an entirely different topic that we can talk about if you want). The point here is that all of this money that is spent on counter-productive "national security" could be easily spent on drastically improving the quality of life for all Americans, provide free health-care and education, and drastically raise the level of minimum wage for US citizens. That is the main reason why Ilhan Omar, as well as many other emerging US politicians are trying to take part in US politics and are actively speaking against wars, and it is the exact same reason why they're being attacked by both the left and the right, who are both profiting from lobbies who in tern profit from the wars that the US is waging all around the world.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!27}1/469 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.213 \\  \hline

My point is with so much money to be made in selling drugs , the resources wasted on a wall is idiotic at best, and criminal at worst. If you're serious about stopping drug smugglers, just legalize all drugs. Instantly cartels will crumble, people will be happier, jobs will be created, prison population will decrease, tax revenue will increase, Overdose deaths will plummet, police forces will shrink, and addiction rates will drop. Yes , I know it sounds counterintuitive that addiction rates will drop but it's TRUE. A lot of the resources gained can be allocated to free treatment facilities. This is a no brainers.

The things I was referring. to were mentioned in previous tweets.  1 of them was "America will not be for white people"Anyway, she has a lot of anger in her and a lot of hate. She doesn't seem to have a great political mind.  Things that are obvious to most people seem to be way above her.  She's relying way too much on her Somalian voters in Minnesota and should be thinking about the future of the Democratic Party.   It makes no sense to me to piss off every \textbf{race} of voter and 80 of the party who I guarantee are thinking about ways to get rid of her.  She causes way to much damage and the reason Pelosi keeps on defending her is not because she likes her, but quite the opposite.  She might be voted out or maybe they will restructure her district or maybe try and get her impeached through the tax fraud thing she got caught for.  But who knows, she might become the new leader of the Democrat Party.  I don't care for her because America saved her from a pretty shitty situation, but she doesn't feel privileged with her new Country and amazing job and great Salary.  Seems to come off as a bitter person who is entitled to not only be here, but feels we should feel lucky to have her.  Again, Im talking past tweets about the bad place  America is but not a word about the countries people are fleeing from, so it's really hard to take her seriously.  Sounds like  America is not the worst Country in the world but in the top 5.  I'm not sure if she said this, but you should read her tweets, if there is a \textbf{race} she hasn't offended it would be Somalian Blacks.  I don't think she can get away with this for much longer.

Note that the same number (just over 1/2 million) Jews moved from Arab and North \textbf{African} countries at the time Israel defeated its neighbors and to become a country itself back in 1948.

More research needs to be done on that. Sensitivity is slightly reduced, but the more sexually sensitive areas of the penis are the glans (head), and moreso at the shaft's underside just below glans. The advantage is reduction of bacterial, fungal and viral infections - and it is the viruses (if not adequately washed under the foreskin) that put female partners of uncircumcised males at risk of developing cancer of the cervix. FGM is practiced in different forms but the most extreme entails removal of the clitoris, which (you may know) is the female embryonic equivalent of the penis itself.

Some because they believe the bible says that the Jews need to control the region and have a huge war with Iran in order for Jesus to return. Those with that belief don't care about who dies in the war because they think Christians will be safe in that case. Some are for Israel because they are full on antisemitic and want segregation. Some support Israel gov because of lobbyists. Finally, some just want to avoid being labeled as antisemitic but they don't care about any of the other reasons. I'm sure I've missed some, but that gives you an overview. On the flip side, there may be just as many reasons that someone may be against the Israel gov.

The amount of ridiculous hate towards israel and jews is astonishingly HIGHout of pure ignorance, nearly all of them don't even check on things on, say, how the occupation starts, etcthey just act , with their ignorance , to be pro palestine and extremely anti semitic with jews and israel, without even meeting a jew (no viable jewish community in indonesia  at all)so their stance exist solely because of: their islamic affiliation, and ampified by the very very biased reporting to demonize israel and victimize palestinians and hamasall in all, you can check it yourself no? things like- how did the occupation starts? (arab muslims own action, they invaded and lost, twice ganking and them and lost twice)- israel has been proposing 2 state solution 5 times since their indepence, after they won the muslim arab coalition invasion. Who rejected all of them? palestine (in the early proposals they even proposing to go back to the original british given lines, for CO-EXISTENCE)- while israel is not perfect itself , have you forgot to compare it to nearby muslim nations in the region? under their hand, israel becomes the most proggressive and advanced \textbf{nation} in the whole north african-middle eastern region. Their citizens are mainly secular, and muslims here (20 of israelis are arab muslims) are living a live with better quality and freedom than muslims in islamic nations nearby. Do you see that to be the case with , say,  christians or hindus in those islamic nations? far worse, let alone to jews- even after winning both wars, israel RETURNS its gained land to jordan and egypt (large area too) just for the sake of CO-EXISTENCE with them, even after those nations literally tried to vanguish them before and they lost. Israel propose this as a WINNER in a battle those enemies started, not as a loser, and they still do this for the sake of peace- in early 2000s, they actually pulled back from gaza strip, giving them more liberty for that. What did those palestinians in gaza did? elect HAMAS group (which clearly stated their main goal is eradication of israel), as the governing power. So much for peace-lovers and co-existence eh?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Yes, according to Martin Luther King, Jr. On October 27, 1967, just a few months after the Six Day War, King had dinner with students from Harvard University in Boston. When one of the students criticized Zionists. King was incensed, said 'Don't talk like that!' - and continued with the following: "When people criticize Zionists, they mean Jews. You're talking anti-Semitism!"Beyond that, look at who are the chief critics of Israel: Islamist apologists, \textbf{terrorist} groups, and on the right the alt-Wrong (er, alt -Right) and NeoNazi/supremacist groups.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Zionism is now the development and protection of the Jewish \textbf{nation}. Anti-Zionism is the destruction of a the Jewish \textbf{nation} and Israel.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Josh John from your response it appears that you have absolutely no grasp of the situation. I will provide but one response, so as not to waste one second more than necessary **what items are you referring to. How can you accuse me of lacking a response whilst in the middle of your first response to me**: the quotes by Martin Luther King. Most of us consider him a fairly accurate judge of what is right. He supported Israel as a Jewish \textbf{nation}. As referenced, you did not comment on that. ** What you have a country do that disagrees with another countries policies? Countries sanction each other so show disapproval** no major argument there. The problem arises when Israel is singled out for criticism in international bodies, while much worse offenders are not even referenced due to collaboration with those with similar interests (Muslim majority countries, for example). ** Sanctioning Iran and Russia didn't collapse due to our sanction and neither will isreal** many countries have sanctioned Israel. They are building coalitions with countries such as India and Brazil, but still do need to the political backing of the US due to the asymmetric coalitions (by raw numbers in international bodies) in order to remain secure. *What about the existence of Palestinians? Their land is occupied and being built over. Their villages are being demolished.* I also empathize with the Palestinians. Just think, they were given the entire Gaza strip, replete with infrastructure that included Green Houses for agricultural development when Ariel Sharon forced Israelis out of there in 2005, in order to see if they could put together a productive society. Instead the Palestinians destroyed much of it due to being "Jewish",  elected Hamas, and their government subsequently set of a strategy of attacking Israel via rocket fire and tunnels. This is the same story of Palestinians attacking Jordan from the West Bank via \textbf{terrorist} acts inclusive of plane hijackings in the 1970's. The difference? Jordan responded with the \textbf{Black} September (1970) massacre of 14K Palestinians. When it is the Palestinians that never were granted citizenship in any Arab state after the 1948 war (98 of Mideast land mass), while Jews from other countries were granted citizenship in Israel to join other Jews and endemic Christians and Muslims. One group of people accepts all religious faiths, while another does not....that's why the reference to the growth of the Christian population within Israel.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Nation, Terrorist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Nationality - General, Religious Identity - Muslim & \cellcolor{green!27}3/404 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.743 \\  \hline

Burned them out of said ghettos, stole their property, killed them and scape goated them for the governing state's malfeasance,  REPEATEDLY. It was Christians sweet heart who did this for close to a thousand years. Hmmm let's take a look at present day India and it's conservative Hindu majority prime ministr who was  complicit in up what amounted to \textbf{ethnic} cleansing in Gujarat in the 2002. Or how followers of the Dali Lama's sect of Tibetan Buddhism have assassinated followers of its rival sect. Bottom line, no one religion has monopoly on righteousness nor evil.

Where have you been? Seriously. Meanwhile you have a self professed white christian man that slaughtered Jewish worshipers in a Pittsburgh, PA synagogue. A white Christian man who slaughtered \textbf{black} worshipers in their church before that both of whom probably would shot you too simply for being Chinese and an atheist. As for climate change - that is pretty simple you eat less meat, use less plastic, walk or use public transit, stop throwing things away and repair them, stop wasting water, stop shooting fire works (one of the best things the Chinese government has done which the US needs to follow suit). As far as the situation with the Ujigars, you reap what you sow and know that your descendants will pay the price of brutality exercised by their parents in their names.
