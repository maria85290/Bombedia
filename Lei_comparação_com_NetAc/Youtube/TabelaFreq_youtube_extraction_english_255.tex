How we migrated to America and made the US? Seems like a pretty good thing to me. Appropriation? As in Cultural appropriation? That shit doesn't exist.

Not even close with affirmative action and people have status quos they have to meet, \textbf{black} people are more likely to get jobs or raises that these particular white people are just as if not more qualified. FFS look at the oscars and the outrage about that. I mean \textbf{black} people make up 12 of the population yet are supposed to make up like 50 of the nominees. Its bull shit.

There is factual history that \textbf{Black} people have been the victims of institutionalized oppression and the most victimized group of people in American history by far. Their entire culture was destroyed in slavery. No self identify in culture is significant  unlike all the immigrants today and that is why \textbf{Black} people have white last names today. \textbf{Black} people were still oppressed because of \textbf{Black} codes that held them down in the South for years, they were treated as less than human then. \textbf{Black} people then needed humane basic rights in the 60's in the Civil Rights Movement. \textbf{Black} people have fundamentally benn designed to fail as they have been in the poor class since after slavery. As it has been for generations, they don't grow up in complete homes, they grow up poor, worst possible education, they have no motivation to succeed because they don't have the foundation for it and they see success as something only white people can have from being in society since they don't see a lot of \textbf{Black} people in high profile positions, one \textbf{Black} president who is discriminated against and can't get shit through Congress is not going to change that, they grow up with bad food, many give in to crime very soon in life because of the conditions, they grow up with low income jobs, have multiple kids, etc. The cycle continues. This is just the way of life in these environments, same as anyone who has lived in the inner city conditions, latino, white, etc.........oh but white people are kicked out of clubs and have been called \textbf{racist} so it is worse. You're fucking position can only be \textbf{racist} in saying that \textbf{Black} people are naturally stupid and naturally criminals. White people are not affected by being called \textbf{racist}, they are 70 of the country and have white privilege, they don't give a shit.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The unwillingness to even admit not "ALL" whites are bad speaks volumes. I mean,¬†a good solid majority of ,"white" families weren't even in America in the 1860's. Blaming isn't the answer¬†It is¬† part of the problem. In fact, very few Whites ever¬†owned slaves. To completely look at the issue, how big was the Afro-Muslim slave trade vs the Small Atlantic Slave trade? The¬†Muslim trading of \textbf{African} Slaves dwarfs¬†what went on in the Atlantic, why don't we hear about that?¬†How are Blacks faring in those countries? How about the Kings of \textbf{African} Nations¬†who, ordered fellow Africans rounded up and sold all over the world into Slavery and¬†who¬†profited¬†from the institution of slavery; How are those descendants doing today? I think past¬†events that took place all over the world surrounding slavery were/are despicable and were experienced by a majorities of people all over the world. All Peoples have experienced¬†harshness in one form or Another. It is a fact, White slaves fought in the Roman Coliseum to the death!¬†Hanibal took Europeans as slaves, I think he was North \textbf{African}.¬†My point is¬†laying the entire weight of this Giant¬†institution¬†at the foot of White Americans is short sited. The narrative of resentment and hatred taught to \textbf{black} children is really coming home to roost now. Every day we see \textbf{Black} on white violence way out of proportion to population. Why? In order to over come this and bring all people together its going to take a lot more than some sad personal anecdotes. Sadly, people are so bent on their own narrative that, no other objective facts can be considered. The guy who did this talk seems genuine but any good or progress he might make is erased by the next "racial" hoax blurted out on national TV airwaves. Any good he may do is totally wiped out crime by crime, victim by victim of young \textbf{black}¬†perps who feel as if this was just a small way of ,"putting things right".

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I think what you said is important insofar that we have to see \textbf{racism} as a two-way process: it is not that there is one \textbf{racist} group and one group of victims. Nevertheless, if we want to judge overall consequences and need for intervention, we have to ask ourselves who the disadvantaged community/individual is. Maybe in some areas it is the whites, whereas in others its the blacks and still in others it is all about the language, not the skin color. I see too many people arguing that \textbf{black} people being \textbf{racist} is a counterargument to fighting \textbf{racism} against blacks.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Let me first explain this to you: Privilege- thinking something isn't a problem when it isn't a problem for you personally. Now with that definition, let's examine your comment. James White is expressing his experiences with \textbf{racism} through this Ted Talk. He is a \textbf{black} man. He knows what it is like to be a \textbf{black} man in America and the repercussions that can come from simply having a different skin tone. I.e his examples throughout his talk. By you saying, "you need to teach your grandkids this" and "don't confuse them that this is \textbf{racism}" you are 100 trying to invalidate HIS experiences that you clearly have never had in your life. Also known as privilege. Who are you to decide whether or not his experiences, or those of other \textbf{black} women and men for that matter, reflect a pattern of societal \textbf{racism}. YOU obviously disregard \textbf{racism} because you do not experience it. By stating that those men who were killed were thugs and we're in the wrong place at the wrong time is utterly ignorant. Tamir Rice was a 12 year \textbf{old} boy who was a park with his little fake pellet gun (like a lot of boys of any color are) and he was murdered by police. A 12 year \textbf{old} \textbf{black} boy murdered by an adult white cop. There is no excuse for this. Now take for example the man who killed approx 14 innocent people in Colorado at a movie theater. He was taken ALIVE despite the police knowing there were casualties and he was a threat. This white man who killed people in a movie theater got a trial... Is imprisoned now. What about Tamir Rice's trial? What about Mike Brown's trial? Nowhere because they were murdered and rights to trial and lawful detainment taken away from them. Suddam Hussein was taken alive for Christ sake !! He was given a trial. So before you sit here and say that \textbf{racism} is long gone and things have changed for the \textbf{black} man take another look around you. This is the 21st century and \textbf{racism} is not dead.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Old, Racism & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}13/353 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.683 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Sqyndi¬†There are many different types of discrimination in the world. To assume I do not understand it, you are "invalidating" my experiences in the very same way I am being accused. I may not know what it is like to live as a \textbf{black} American, but I do know some about history. I am not denying the past, just acknowledging the present. Now, as far as the recent shootings deaths you have mentioned, I have two different views, so I do not feel the one case belongs in this conversation, that case being Tamir's. As far as Mike Brown, I stand as I have already commented, learn to comply when approached by Law Officials. The movie theater shooter DID comply, that is why he was NOT shot and killed. He stopped and gave up, did not try to run off. Tamir was killed by an over eager, \textbf{racist} , trigger happy police officer as far as I am concerned. The child was not given a chance in hell. Yes, the child was wrong for pointing the gun at people in the park, but the officer drove up on top of this boy and shot him within two seconds of approach according to video and reports.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/206 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.971 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I'm saying you do not understand racial discrimination. Just because you've had a hard life or have experienced prejudices doesn't mean you are exempt from perpetuating white supremacy in our culture. I'm a white female and understand I receive privileges socio-economically because I am white. To disregard the disadvantages \textbf{black} men and women face societally and economically is a travesty. Look up any govt stats and you'll see major differences between whites and minorities with incarceration rates,income,schooling. This is \textbf{racism}. In regards to Mike Brown, he was unarmed. Even if he had ran away from police, this is not worthy of receiving multiple bullet holes in the body-causing death.The epidemic here is how police handle \textbf{black} "suspects" and white "suspects" especially when racial profiling is a HUGE part of the police force. The thing that irks me when you are stating the importance of compliance is you're disregarding countless cases where compliance for \textbf{black} men and women were ignored and ultimately resulted in deaths. Eric Garner's death is a prime example of this. You can watch his death video on YouTube. I think it's unfortunate that you are giving an end all be all statement like " comply with the police or it's your fault" when there are so many cases and factors that prove what you're are saying isn't the most accurate. Concluding thought, why would \textbf{black} men and women feel they must comply with a culture that is \textbf{racist} towards them and has oppressed them from the beginning of their existence ? I wouldn't blame them for not wanting to.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}6/262 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.29 \\  \hline

In this particular discussion I was never referring to the case of the 12 year \textbf{old} young child in the park. I was appalled by that incident and in no way felt that LE was in the right for shooting and killing this young boy.  We were discussing "compliance" with authority. When an officer pulls you over to the side of the road, or stops you on the street to ask you questions, it is your place as a citizen to comply. You have the right to ask for ID for your own safety and to be treated with respect to your person, but you also need to treat that man with the badge with respect. He has authority OVER YOU, like it or not. It is his job. If you did \textbf{nothing} wrong you will have your chance to prove that. You can even fight a simple speeding ticket. Why give the officer, who is carrying a deadly weapon a hard time, unless you're a total, brainless idiot?That was what I was trying to convey in my comments. The police are and should be here to protect us. If you feel you are being stopped for the wrong reason, show respect for the badge and the authority it carries and plead your case before a judge. No one gets hurt, no one dies, and we don't have all of these butt hurt people feeling they need to protest and shoot officers that have families and are just doing their jobs.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nothing, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}2/275 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.727 \\  \hline

Case in point,¬†yesterday,(today is 03/29/15)¬†a white police officer in Boston was shot in the face by a \textbf{black}¬†man. One TV channel covered it. Head lines just said, "cop shot by man" . Now if it was a white cop who shot a \textbf{black} man, before any evidence has been presented, the headline would read, WHITE COP GUNS DOWN \textbf{BLACK} MAN.¬†¬† Double standard, period.I am so tired of hearing that blacks can't be \textbf{racist}, only whites can. That is a great attitude to start a discussion on \textbf{race} relations with.¬†¬† I am very sorry for what Mr. White and many other blacks went through but I am not one bit apologetic.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small First off gentrification and the lack of education andthe lack of jobs is the reason why the \textbf{black} neighbors are the way they are. Bro do a check on the number of \textbf{black} men killed by police since the 60. Just 60 years ago \textbf{black} people couldn't drink out the same water fountain as whites. The people that run this country are those people children.  You really think that hatred wasn't passed on. And you right there are \textbf{racist} \textbf{black} people. .. and I bet you if went jogging through a hood with me you wouldn't get robbed. You right there's a little double standard but in truth is the under dog needs that other wise it would continue to be invisible in the public eye. There are some cases that are skeptical.  Oh also the \textbf{black} man may get a brake in the media but not in the court room. They Give Blacks Way More Jail time than any other \textbf{race}. Fact... look up what suburban white kids and some charges, Look up the time they got for the crime, then look up some \textbf{black} cases for the same charges and see who gets more time.

Life is unfair to each and everyone of us. That doesn't mean we give up.

Maybe there are skills that you could develop personally and professionally, tools are available online for free that can develop career oriented skills that maybe you were lacking, try doing that, and keep trying after to find a job because that's what it's going to take to succeed in this life.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Mr. White, Please hear me out, I am not a \textbf{racist}, and I'm sure you are not either. But as you explained their are too many of us¬†that are. However, contrary to your responsible attitude and way of life, their are too many crime ridden areas in our country that are mostly \textbf{black}. Can you explain that?..... Is it lack of opportunity? Lack of education?¬†Lack of parental responsibility? ........ Are they just victims of their environment?........ I think not on all counts. I believe that \textbf{racism} is embodied in the chip on a \textbf{black} persons shoulder and grows heavier each time they are rejected in favor of a white. I truly wish it was¬†not like this. \textbf{Black} crime in¬†this free country we call¬†"America The Land of Opportunity" is the opportunity most rejected \textbf{black} males choose. It is the easy way out. I am 64 years \textbf{old} and remember¬†MLK¬†Jr. and Kennedy and RFK and Malcolm¬†X and all the really inspirational leaders that simply would not stand for this. We now have trash like Al Sharpton stirring up the pot. Believe me I know a leader when I see one and you are the real deal..... It's too bad that¬†the police don't see¬†Blacks as human beings. I live in Louisville and we had a \textbf{black} police chief for a long while. \textbf{Nothing} changed. \textbf{Black} crime continued and opportunist \textbf{Black} so-called "leaders" tried to change¬†our city. I guess what I'm trying to say is, teach¬†young \textbf{black} people they are Americans first and \textbf{black} second. They are not slaves, they are not helpless, they¬†should not rely¬†on the government to support them after they have 4 or¬†5 children out of wedlock. Teach them to respect themselves and they may choose to follow your path. The military saved your life! and I think you know that. It is clearly evident in your speaking. Thanks for the talk.
