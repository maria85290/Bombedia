  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I feel compelled to be devil's advocate here. In the 1940s, a lowly graduate student observed the antagonistic effects of microorganisms in the soil. Day and night for weeks and months, Albert Schatz grew and observed microbes isolated from the soil in the search for potentially useful antibiotics. Once he observed a promising result, he worked painstakingly to isolate and test the effectiveness of this antibiotic. He told his supervisor (Selman Waksman), who promptly took care to pocket the royalties, public recognition and also the Nobel Prize. Waksman traveled all over the place to present 'his' work. Listen to the description of Jocelyn Bell's work in the video, and you will find both cases eerily similar. But, of course, Schatz's stolen work is not possibly a case of \textbf{sexism}. But if his story had been unchanged except for his \textbf{gender}, it would almost certainly stand as a modern example of \textbf{sexism}. I am not saying that \textbf{sexism} wasn't prevalent during the time the video and I have described, but let's just hold on to our horses first, and analyse each case by its merits. Often, scientists are just too eager for credit, and loose sight of fairness in the process.I hope this comment doesn't get lost amongst the thousands of others. If you found this comment reasonable, please upvote it. (That sounded a lot more pedantic than I hoped... I;'m just really passionate about the history of science and especially the rise of modern medicine) PS read Experiment Eleven: Deceit and Betrayal in the Discovery of the Cure for Tuberculosis by Peter Pringle for details on the Schatz story. It's an easy read and gives insight into the student supervisor dynamics of the time.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}4/285 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.404 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Those stories aren't examples of \textbf{sexism}, but rather examples of scientists with fewer credentials being laughed off by other scientists with more credentials! There are plenty of examples of this happening to male scientists, such as Wagner when he postulated the idea of plate tectonics, Frank Whittle when he invented the jet engine, Louis Pasteur with the idea of germ theory, Stewart Goodwin with Helicobacter pylori and a whole bunch of other examples! If there is \textbf{sexism} in science, that you have to show that women's ideas are unjustly ridiculed at a higher rate than men's ideas!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/97 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.062 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Of course. And Einstein stole his ideas from his wife and actually he was a \textbf{woman}. Regardless, what about the thousands of much brighter male scientists whose ideas were ridiculed? What about Boltzmann who committed suicide because of that? What about male scientists who were burned at the stake by the inquisition? It seems to me like the \textbf{sexism} is the other way around if the yardstick of \textbf{sexism} in science is how much a \textbf{sex} suffers for being ridiculed. But I do not believe this story about the genius female who was ridiculed because she was female. It sounds too much like feminist propaganda, too artificial, too convenient to the ideologically driven in order to be true. At worse she was ridiculed because her ideas seemed outrageous, no other reason. Now in the academia people are afraid to call the ridiculous ideas of a \textbf{woman} ridiculous because then they get in trouble with the politically corect establishement. The same with blacks and other protected groups that cannot be touched, criticised, even looked at in a way that can be construed funny. How many more billions of dollars have to be wasted, how many really talented male scientists will have to be discarded before the obvious, the reasonable, the factual will be recognized, namely that women cannot do science.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Sex, Sexism, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}5/219 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.283 \\  \hline

We know next to \textbf{nothing} about them. It seems every year the idea of a \textbf{black} whole is fizzling apart. Isn't it far more likely that we vastly misunderstand gravity, \textbf{black} holes, and the forces? Instead we create this force that is completely undetectable, that we know \textbf{nothing} about, and governs all the problems of the universe that we don't understand. It reminds me a lot of the debate when light was discovered to travel in a vacuum and many people thought there was an "ether" that made up most of space to allow electromagnetic waves to travel.I'm no physicist.

She never publicly criticized the Nobel prize committee decision. In fact, in 1977 she said: There are several comments that I would like to make on this: First, demarcation disputes between supervisor and student are always difficult, probably impossible to resolve. Secondly, it is the supervisor who has the final responsibility for the success or failure of the project. We hear of cases where a supervisor blames his student for a failure, but we know that it is largely the fault of the supervisor. It seems only fair to me that he should benefit from the successes, too.

Humans have a thing called "Same group preference" Studies have shown that if you take a white test subject and test his preference for a bunch of other subjects. He will show preference for whites over blacks. A \textbf{black} subject will show the same preference for blacks.You can even take a bunch of white subjects, and put a "Blue Team" shirt on  half, and a "\textbf{R\textbf{ed}} Team" shirt on the other half. and blue team members will prefer their own team.This is same group preference. HOWEVER. While females show a very strong same group preference. Males do not as a group. If you make two teams "Men's Team" and "Women's Team" and tell both a man and a \textbf{woman} to choose things. They will show preference for females. almost 100 of the time. Females are the preferred group across the board. This is why I think "\textbf{Patriarchy}" falls flat, because for their to be a "\textbf{Patriarchy}" you have to believe that if you take 100 people, 90 are women and 10 are men. then you say that those 10 are in charge and make ALL the rules. You have to believe that they would turn the 90 women into slaves to do their bidding.History shows this is not the case.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Joey Hauschildt Firstly, This has \textbf{nothing} to do with Muslim countries. We are Discussing Michio Kaku and the "\textbf{Sexism}" he experiences at work.Secondly I think you need to research slavery, because what women experience, EVEN in Muslim countries. while horrendous in many cases. is NOT slavery. Please research what slavery is. As I find it deeply and horribly offensive that you would claim women have been slaves for all recorded history. Anyone with a grade school education in History knows slavery involves chains, backbreaking work, and the murder of those who try to escape.Even in \textbf{black} slavery of the united states, there were laws protecting \textbf{black} women from physical abuse, murder, and rape. Yes sociopaths and horrible people did do terrible things to \textbf{black} women, including but not limited to raping and killing them. Just consider the logistics of a legislature which considered a \textbf{race} of people property, that they had no more rights than cattle, literally. Where you could beat them, chop of the front part of their feet, whip them until death, and hang them for the smallest transgression...Consider the logistics of that legislature making laws to protect only the female half from such abuses. It does not matter that the penalty for breaking these laws was a minor fine and a stern talking to. The men were not offered even that protection.women have been a privileged class in "Almost" every civilization in recorded history. I include current day Muslim nations in the "Privileged" class. Give me any examples you have of women having it worse than men. and I will cede the argument to you.
