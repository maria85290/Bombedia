  \cellcolor{green!27}\small This is what feminists do. They tried to ride the coat tails of other people's success and try to claim that they're responsible for this person's reaching their goal. They do not work for their goals, they just want the rewards that come with it. I love how Judge Judy says feminism was not the reason why she's so successful, but the fact that she herself put in the effort to reach where she's at today. Be an individual not a feminist. Being a \textbf{woman} does not make you a feminist.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/91 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.099 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Feminists hate judge judy for saying this because she's a strong, independent \textbf{woman} who doesn't rely on some stupid organization to help her. Feminists needs weak willed, vulnerable women so they can play with their minds and put them against men. Without those women, feminists would have no purpose, so they have no choice but to bring down and belittle other insecure women so they can use them as pawns for their game.Feminists truly are an infection, and strong, independent, and self-made women are the cure for it.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/89 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.124 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Grim Reefer isn't that what the feminist movement wants? For men to pull out of society and give women total control?

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small When you see women protesting against the podium and grid girls, they're always shall we say not attractive in comparison to the grid girls, so it seems being beautiful is a crime in the feminist mindset, perhaps these women feel oppressed by other women whose beauty they don¬°t have, so not only are the feminists attacking men with the \textbf{old} toxic masculinity ruse, they are attacking women too for not wallowing in the victimhood barrel.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I really appreciate this Judge Judy. I'm... an ex feminist? I'm trying to find my way and figure out why I would want to take on a man child when men and children are work (maybe worth it, but work) and I can pay my own bills.But I appreciate what you said about being an individualist- I was a scientist for a decade- and I hate it when people say there's a glass ceiling in science- I wasn't "a \textbf{woman} scientist"- I was a scientist- because I was capable and interested in it.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Feminism doesn't care about women's rights at all, because in feminism, women are always the ones who are oppressed (unless you stop thinking of yourself as a \textbf{woman}).

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small As far as the me-too movement goes it's cancer just like feminism Mike Pence rule for everyday life avoid women at all cost they are a liability not just in the workplace but in the marriage and The Dating Game and marriage women say taking care of these kids the 24-hour job I wonder how they see their husbands I guess there a 24-hour job 2 do you look at the dating game all you got to do and say sorry ma'am you're just not my type next thing you know getting hauled off by the police because her ego was hurt or other things or worse I see when a man goes to prison for a false claim is a death sentence even Judge Judy knows it you're going to get shanked and bent over by Bubba and a lot of women don't give a s*** A lot of them want to play the victim role you know get that sympathy point good people to do what she wants them to do narcissistic behavior among many other things and that's basically the majority of women marriage was destroyed so wish every men are just waiting for the artificial womb to be developed life will find a way I do believe a man said that Jeff Bloomberg in Jurassic Park men have always turn to science life will find a way the artificial womb is in development maybe women don't have what you call Selective Service after all like it donating their eggs and then can go shopping they refused to change the laws of marriage since the 1800s for men you know those laws that protect women but women change the laws to manipulate marriage among other things and the government allowed it so maybe women will have a new job selling their eggs for \$100 a piece men had no problems back in the 18 hundreds of raising their kids up to be proper how to treat each other as men and women and avoid the Wicked Man and the wicked women see the problem with it is as women Sat by and prospered from Wicked women and didn't do \textbf{nothing} to put the dose wicked women in their place when you see it all the time and it's going to get worse and worse until the artificial womb comes out then women can focus on not dating we're having children they can go to the local sperm bank and go shopping for themselves just don't be nailing the donors for child support or they won't be jerking off and cups in that sperm bank any longer all that's right they stop doing that a while ago only the ones with low IQ and no intelligent keep doing that women are freezing their eggs at number rates like I said a hundred bucks a egg I guess I have been your official one comes out men know how to raise their children and teach them right from wrong and they don't smother the children and allow them to get the cookie when they break the lamp cuz they were running through the house are they smart off they go to the room without their little toys but they're really bad he'll go to the room without supper and learn some gratitude some respect I don't believe in sparing the rod and spoiling the child women however do that's why we have a problem with Society with a bunch of people being wind babies and having their hands out that's why the fathers were very important to stay within the family what did women do they drove away and off the plantation forever and because of me too you made it ten times actually a thousand times worse good job girl power\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}1/633 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.158 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I get what she is saying but i don't agree with it completely. I am a feminist and i love supporting other women. Not unreasonably, but when i see any sort of discrimination, i like standing up for them. Saying that that means my success belongs to Feminism, is the same as attributing one's success to one's Religion, Country, \textbf{Race}, etc. If this is the reason to denounce Feminism, then one should denounce all these other things too. No \textbf{race}, no country, no religion, etc. Only then can success be truly one's own?Another issue i have with these sort of conversations is that there is always so much concern for what the men might feel, and how "afraid" they are. Why does a debate, which is about women, always turn into assuaging the fears and hesitations of men? This is where feminism comes in for me. When certain topics are discussed, it should remain about the people concerned. Not about others. This "But-What-About-Men-And-There-Feelings" attitude is what i dislike. First, the problem needs to be addressed and only then you go to take care of the side affects. One does not reject Chemotherapy because there will be puking and hair loss and headache and so on. One gets certain medication for the unfortunate side effects. And lastly a bit of caution being injected in the work place is hardly an evil, if the consequences of that are a reduction in \textbf{sexual} harassment, discrimination or even a toxic atmosphere. When as a child, i was told to be careful when out playing with my friends, i did not feel like my fun got cramped. I just knew, that if i follow certain rules, i would be safe. \textbf{Nobody} stopped me from playing outside. The same applies here. Men and women can be anything they want with each other, but it does not mean that a bit of caution on both sides will ruin everyone's joy.

These women are obviously not against feminism they are against men hating women and feminazis, not actual feminism.Feminism-the advocacy for women's rights on the basis of the equality of the sexes.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Sexism & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/130 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.769 \\  \hline

It's needed to go after people like Harvey Weinstein And Larry Nassar but it has created it's own backlash and it's own unintended consequences such making the "boys' clubs" into bigger Boys' clubs since employers know hiring men will mean there is likely be little to no \textbf{sexual} harassment in the work place. It may also thicken the glass ceiling for women because where men might be inclined to hire more women in leadership roles, they know that can spell trouble because all it takes is one accusation, be it true or false and a man's career is done. It's interesting how successful women are not identifying as Feminists because they know the label doesn't serve as a good label.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small D M You see the problem is you think that it's a great thing labelling yourself as a Feminist, but actually its not the same definition as it used to be.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small She is incredibly intelligent. I have lots of respect for her. But I disagree with her 'Individualist' stance. Unfortunately, none of us exist as individuals independent of society, culture, and the beliefs that are embedded in that society and culture. To an extent we have 'free will'. I can choose to wear a \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} shirt or blue shirt. Or eat chips or cake. But as far as big life decisions that impact our lives and essentially create our lives - they are hindered or helped by things like \textbf{race}, sexuality, class, \textbf{gender}, etc. Individuals do not exist in a vacuum. They never have and never will. Just because \textbf{black} people are not lynched in the streets and women are not viewed as property does not mean we are all on a level playing field and it's really unfortunate. Imagine a \textbf{black} child born in a bad part of town, both parents are drug addicts, they have no money or time to create a good life for their child. That kid is going to have a different idea of 'normal' and 'acceptable' than a rich white kid raised in the suburbs by a loving family.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Hm, it doesn't make sense. 1. Feminism is not a group that has meetings, it's a evolving set of ideals and individual envisions 2. Everyone relies or looks up to someone. I'm sorry. Life has been done a thousand times. Lived a thousand times. Women in power roles are either failed attempt eroded or not discussed since it doesn't chive with the core values of the community leaders representative elects. We all look up to someone. During her time period she had the gift of knowing Eleanor Roosevelt. A well known and highly regarded feminist. She received a stunning standing ovation in a legal forum amongst other countries (stricter anti women policies) for the rights of women and children. Surely anyone would be inspired and moved by the works of Maya Angelou. If you have no one to look up to, you have \textbf{nothing} to spark that desire.

When she says she's not a feminist, she's talking about being a consciously involved activist like Elizabeth Stanton and Susan B. Anthony and Eleanor Roosevelt. Don't get it twisted that the work these women did and pain they suffered allowed women to be as free and independent as they are today. An opposite example is Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 85, who was one of only 9 women in her Harvard Law class with 500 men .. she did fight for women's equality, graduated at the top of her class, started the first law journal in the US focused on women's rights, co-founded the women's rights division at the ACLU, and argued and won 5 Supreme Court cases against \textbf{gender} discrimination.

It's up to you on how you will take that complement and whether you will feel comfortable or uncomfortable by it.Just because you "might" feel "uncomfortable" doesn't mean that that now everyone should change themselves because of your way of life and thinking.

It's in our nature. The only problem here is that you are intellectually incapable of understanding this.You are not special. Your views and opinions are not special. Their worth is the same of any other person's opinions and thoughts.Oh, and one more thing.

The metoo movement is good but must be careful not to demonize men for acting reasonably natural.I dont condone inappropriate comments/actions obviously but we need to understand our basic natures. Nature has made it so that men compete for women and must win their approval in order to be accepted as a mate. Compliments are a form of trying to gain approval and since completion is fierce (only 40 of men have kids while 80 of women have kids consistently throughout all of history ) they take any chance they can get. I find it funny that women in the west still dont understand that they would have 200 control of everything if they changed how they chose their mates. \textbf{Skinny} jeans exist because men think it will make them more attractive to women, they crush their balls just for the small chance of finding a mate. If you can get guys to do that you can get them to do just about anything.Unfortunately nature has made it so that the bad boys are attractive(there are biological reasons) and that makes other men follow their lead with more bad behavior. The women fall for the badboys and that only creates more badboys.   In Asia the styles have become ultra \textbf{effeminate} because women decided to select mates based on that  \textbf{effeminate} style and the men followed suite.

Work and someone's professional competence should be at the center of attention here, and triggering people's \textbf{sexual} instincts with your appearance distracts from that. I think this accentuating of the female body and sexuality (with makeup, clothes, high-heeled shoes, jewelry) stems from a time when women could not get ahead in society by getting a good education and a good job (because they were considered too stupid to become, say, judges). All they could do was use their bodies to attract a wealthy husband. Then, as a result of feminist battles, things started to change (although Judge Judy is convinced she did it all on her own). So now, in the workplace, women who want to be valued for their professional capabilities should stop acting like they are desperate to catch a man. And I don't agree with Peterson when he says that men's suits are purely functional and there is \textbf{nothing} \textbf{sexual} about them (they are \textbf{sexual}!), but women generally take their appearance so much further.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nothing, Sexual & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}5/183 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.732 \\  \hline

It is not something that you can change in people. Based on your views or personal ethics or political correctness or "modern \textbf{gender} views". You can only supress it in people.

I have no desire to discuss this. Human endevours are driven by \textbf{sexual} selection. It's hardwired in us biologically. And no amount of feminism or new social constructs or dogma can change that.  It can be only supressed and warped. And we will end up with even uglier humanity if this ever succeeds... Anyhow. If you think that makeup isn't OK at workplace, your only reasoning for this could be that it's \textbf{sexual} (which it clearly is). But the feminists and "progressives" will attack you for his.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@fix Oh very well. As you know, alimony is when the higher-earning spouse gives financial support to the lower-earning one, which is disproportionately women. However, more women are paying alimony now than before because they're making more money (thanks modern feminism). Most parents agree between themselves that custody will go to the mother, but fathers who actively seek custody obtain either primary or joint physical custody over 70 of the time. One of the reasons for income inequality is that women hold jobs while disproportionately doing housework and childcare duties. Because of this double burden, they earn money on top of having to do most unpaid domestic work. The STEM field is particularly hostile towards women, you can find a lot of research on that, it's not a good example, and no the highest paying jobs are not the most dangerous ones. Women should demand equal pay, or at least the social institutions that would allow for this, because they should not have to do more work than men only to be paid less. That's not entitlement, that's just fair. If you can't tell the difference between \textbf{sexual} harassment and flirting, you are not safe for women to be around. 1 in 3 women report to have been sexually harassed at work, and 65 have reported being harassed on the street. When you are a \textbf{woman} who is constantly treated this way, yes it has an effect on your \textbf{mental} health. What law are you talking about? A law that forbids flirting? Lol that's a no.Feminists are fighting a meaningful fight now, all you've shows is your ignorance and lack of concern for problems women are facing. No, women cannot cat-call, touch, or flirt with any guys they want, and if a \textbf{woman} thinks she can she should be treated the same way a man is. Some people might think this isn't as serious because it's mostly men who sexually harass women.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Jayce Johnson Alimony = Yes. But my point is, even women of higher income than their spouse/ex refused to give it to their ex. And they even had the support of media and feminists group. Want me to give an example?Income = Sure women does household chores much more than men. But that is a problem between u and ur husband. It has \textbf{nothing} today with ur boss being oppressive towards u. Ur boss does not care about personal problems. They just want deadlines. So stop pushing companies to pay u higher when u work less hours than men. Negotiate with ur husband, hire a nanny, whatever. Find a solution to get ahead in ur career. Dont forced ur boss to pay u as much as other people when u work less hours. Your boss doesnt care about who do the most chores or who takes care of ur babies more. Lol. Get real. And btw, a lot of moms want to work less hours anyway. That is why a lot more women take part time jobs compared to men. Because they want to spend timw with their kids much more than dads want to. There is a bond between mom and kids that are in most cases much stronger than dad with kids. Which is \textbf{nothing} wrong with that but again dont blame ur boss. STEM = Women are not being discriminated in STEM fields. They themselves choose not to go into STEM fields in general. In college the rate of application of STEM field is overwhelmingly bigger among the male students as opposed to females and women tends to choose something to do with business, social science, nursing, etc. Which of course pays significantly less. I dont see there is \textbf{nothing} wrong with that. If women choose to do something which is less lucrative but they have a passion over it. Why should it be a problem?

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Celisar1 You've just watched an example of what a truly strong \textbf{woman} is like. You're talking about institutionalized discrimination of which there is absolutely no evidence that it even exists. In fact there is solid data that it doesn't. Not saying that discrimination doesn't happen, but widescale discrimination is always an economic cost to the discriminator not necessarily the discriminated, it is therefore not tenable. Feminism is a real world manifestation of how women compete. Men compete on the basis of agressiveness and assertiveness. They duke it out and then it's over. Women generally lack those qualities so they resort to other tactics, commonly "innuedo, gossip and reputation destruction" (quoting). Historically women competed with other women, men were favored as resources. Now women have brought these qualities into the competitive world of men and seeking to change the way the game is played in their favor. It's a self-serving, manipaulative, toxic and utimately destructive form of behavior. This is why feminism is so aptly equated to cancer.Modern feminism is \textbf{nothing} like the civil rights movement. Western women are the most privileged human beings that ever walked the earth, accounting for over 80 of all domestic spending in the economy, in addition to the fact that most male spending is on women.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Stafford Stafford, no, white men did not start with the same as everyone else. They had more privilege and advantages in society. You either forget or you never learned what life used to be like for women in America. It used to be women weren't allowed to vote. They were discouraged from getting a real education and from working at all. And when they did work, they could usually only find jobs as teachers, nurses, and secretaries (though there was a time that teaching was mostly a male profession anyway). And if a \textbf{woman} was married, companies often wouldn't hire her because they thought she'd get pregnant and they'd have to find a replacement. And if women got pregnant, their bosses would often fire them just for that. There was no maternity leave. Women weren't allowed to apply for loans or buy real estate without their husband's or father's signature and permission.But during many of the wars we've had, women had to enter the workforce to replace the men who had been drafted to fight. But when the wars were over, they were often fired and replaced by the returning men, even though many of those women lost their fathers and husbands in the war, so they HAD to go to work to support themselves or their now fatherless children, but many couldn't find work because most employers preferred men. Or if they found work, it paid much less to women than it did for men, so they did not make enough to support their kids.That's all feminism is about, it's about fairness. And it goes both ways. It used to be that men weren't considered for nursing positions, or child care, or even teaching, cooking, or baking because employers just assumed men weren't good at those things. But men who have a talent for those things should not be denied the chance to do them just because they are men.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/323 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.31 \\  \hline

A lot of people died (mostly men) fighting for the right to be free of servitude and to get the vote - look at the USA's own revolutionary war to break away from the British state, there's a high male body count. Up until 1884 only landowners could vote in Britain (about 30 of the men). In 1918 finally all men could vote and women over 30. Then in 1928 Britain made voting rights equal. The general male population has only about 30 years advantage over the average \textbf{woman} with a very high body count to achieve it.

It comes down to the \textbf{old} saying about how "A man is the head but the \textbf{woman} is the neck, and she can turn the head any way she wants". What women lack in the ability to dominate or otherwise physically stand their ground, they more than make up for it in their ability to influence and persuade, for good or ill. Women's ability to influence and persuade others has made them very able politicians and power brokers in their own right over the the centuries and millennia, if pursuit of political power and independence was the path any of them chose (or if, through circumstance, the path was chosen for them). Women do have resourcefulness, inner strength and an inner greatness that are very admirable and should, rightfully, be revered. Really, a man cannot dominate or otherwise lead a \textbf{woman} without her agreeing to it: It's just like in Eleanor Roosevelt's immortal words "No one can make you feel inferior without your consent". Every \textbf{woman} has power, she just has to "nut-up" and use it!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Old, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}4/219 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.826 \\  \hline

It always amazes me how people automatically think that there are less women on top (or in male-dominated careers) because there probably are not as many qualified women as men, or that it is the case because women choose family over career, or that they simply are not interested in that area of work, and that is not true.

It's not an accident that the most authoritative women at work are the complete opposite at home. If she had the same "masculine" behaviour at home, the relationship wouldn't work. All of this is science yet feminists want to call you sexist when you state it. I'm far from sexist and anyone willing to do the research can do it at any point rather than pushing the narrative that men are just sexist. Women are more than half of the population and could vote all women in most government positions if they wanted to. The reason they don't is largely because women don't run for those positions as they prefer other work.

We also all have had help from innovation and technology that people from the past have worked hard to create so that life could be better for everyone.  So to say you got somewhere all under your own power is a bit delusional and comes from shallow thinking, I think.I wish today's feminists would realize that we can't change things by bashing men over the head to try to make them treat us better. In reality, there is only a small percent of men who are truly sexists in a way that is damaging.  Most of the damage actually is systemic---not from any one individual.   The \textbf{sexism} is directly caused from the socioeconomic system we continue to adhere to, a system that was born out of intense inequality and strife.  Things like \textbf{sexism}, \textbf{racism}, and inequality are built into the system's mode of operation so there will always be a trend towards those things, we'll always be fighting that inclination in some way.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Feminism means different things these days and has mistakenly included other ideas that social justice warriors get too far ahead of themselves with.  The whole idea behind feminism is simply equality.  Before it was about rights, and now it seems more about what comes with those rights.  We have the right to work, but equal pay is still an issue and there is workplace \textbf{sexism}.  We have the right to go to school, but many women are discouraged from STEM careers due to harassment, \textbf{gender} bias, or because of the sacrifices required.  When I was studying pre-med, I was given a book where the entire book described what women should consider before becoming a doctor and it basically said if you want to be pregnant before 30, don't become a doctor.  Also how our culture and the media portrays women is really important.  \textbf{Sexual} violence against women is almost never taken as seriously as when it happens to a man - why?  There are even some states where laws make it harder to accuse a husband of \textbf{sexual} assault.  And keep in mind, outside of western countries, many women have it far worse.  Feminism is important, and the fight for equality shouldn't stop just because some people ruin the definition for their own political gain.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender, Sexism, Sexual & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}4/215 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.86 \\  \hline

You expect a \textbf{woman} in her 20's that has a child to focus on her child AND become a doctor?? SO sorry, you can only chose one. People these days don't take parenting as seriously anymore. It's a wonderful, meaningful job and I wish it would stop being seen as something ANYONE can do... because MANY people are not fit to be parents at all! Many parents fail their children because of there is a wrong way and a right way to raise a child.Sorry, but women aren't superhumans. They simply cannot take on the pressure and stress of an 80 hour work week, which is considered normal for a doctor, and make sure to be there for her child emotionally, physically and spiritually to make sure her child is getting the best care and attention that it needs.

The feminist movement resulted in the \textbf{woman} to have choices, to have a right to choose how she lives. She can now say to her husband to help her out with cooking, while she is taking a jog in her pants around the neighborhood. It is an example of basic human choices and freedoms.

I am amazed how many people in your country are so unaware, even these great intelligent fantastic women. It is unfortunate. Also, the concept of being a hero in this individualistic perspective is...disturbingly modern and honestly a bit worriying. No civilisation was build on that anyway. Maybe individualism is the cause to the problems your country is having?Edit: Thank you for the discussion.

It seems that individualism is something that Americans are very proud of, despite that your democratic processes and social justice victories, as well as industrial development and innovations, has been realized through collective efforts (even if you readily point out single leaders).

Lastly, there are lots of issues feminism is still battling. It is not a battle against men and there is no exclusive angry sisterhood. It is against \textbf{sexism} and violence against women, it is for opening up male-dominating areas of work to women, equal pay for the same job done, for equal salary growth for women after maternity leave, and so much more. In Scandinavia, we work a lot on equality. For example, no government (nor EU) funded project is approved if the issue of equality has not been thoroughly discussed and applied as part of the method and goals. Much of that work's result is already being seen. If you are interested, there is a lot to read about the work that Scandinavia has done and how wonderful the effects are not only in regards to women, but also to families.

It's not the actual new generations of feminist which gave you the possibility to work, vote and not just raise kids so she's not discussing a link with the ones who got these milestones actually. She's discussing if she would call herself one now.Many people who don't feel really close of current feminist like her would gladly congrats the former feminists who actually did bring this step for progress you discussed.To be frank, 3 times out of 4 when I see a feminist in medias nowadays she's talking about the most absurd things  like manspreading etc... Of course you have surveys saying nearly 100 of young UK women are for \textbf{gender} equality but only 40 call themselves feminists after that. If you rarely see anything but posers among the ones claiming to be feminist you're not tented to "join" them.It's why the feminist renew from 2013 went weaker. Same thing already happened in the 90's, feminism was extremely discussed then it became a quite divisive term and even a dirty word for some people because of its excess.What matters is people intentions no?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small natzki spionen To your point that Individualism is a problem. We see throughout history certain INDIVIDUALS make their mark. These individuals had a huge singular impact throughout the world or at least in their own countries: Technology; Bill Gates, Steven Jobs, Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, Alexander Bell...Science; Albert Einstein, Charles Darwin, Louis Pasteur, Marie Curie, Galileo Galilei, Ernest Rutherford, Francis Crick, Max Born...Social Justice;  Mahatma Gandhi, Rosa parks, Martin Luther King, Margaret Sanger...I'm not sure what your specific complaint against individuals is. Some people may take personal issue with some of these examples being that they may not agree with their philosophy or their ideals; However, they did result in a very large impact on society. One could write a novel about all of the individuals throughout history that have impacted the world. It is from these individuals that we now have groups of people supporting and using their concepts, ideas, and philosophy. While it is true that many voices can be heard louder than one, it starts with one first. I personally think that group think mentality can be far more hazardous to a society then just individual thought. Group think, or general consensus in the scientific world has in the past caused the deaths of many individuals. Ignazio Semmelweis discovered germ theory in the 1840's and briefly was able to save many lives but because of group mentality he was persecuted and de- credited and ultimately ended up in a \textbf{mental} institution. We see what group think does in a large scale through fascist, communistic, and dictatorship governments. Our government was set up as a Republic for the people and by the people to protect the rights of the individuals. Not the other way around. As stated b4, we have made amendments to our Constitution and signed into law Civil Rights that act as protections under Law to American citizens. Our \textbf{nation} was founded by individuals for individual rights and has always remained that way. Like every other \textbf{nation}, we have gone through cultural changes.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small natzki spionen You seem to be going around and around trying to make the same irrelevant point. In America, discrimination against women is illegal. PERIOD. Is it legal to discriminate in Sweden? The United States of America has many women's programs, to think otherwise is an insult or ignorance or both. I don't understand your hostility towards the individual human being. What about the concept of one \textbf{woman}, one individual? You did make your point clear that you were vehemently opposed to the idea of the individual person and assisting an individual versus group identity. In the US if a \textbf{woman} is receiving less pay than her male counterpart doing the same job she can file a discrimination lawsuit and Win that is why companies do NOT pay less to women. Because it's illegal. Many jobs have negotiable contracts, so if you are not as good at negotiating your rate of pay/benefits or bring less value/skills/potential...then you may not expect the same pay as your fellow co-workers. We already have EQUAL PAY! It's the LAW! Do you not have equal pay laws in Sweden? The basic concepts that suffragettes and women of the past brought forward have benefited us women of today. But to say that you are still fighting for equality may be true of Sweden but not of the United States. I stated before we already have Federal and State laws and many programs that are already and have been in effect to protect Women from many forms of discrimination. Like anything else in life if you're miss treated and run into a legal issue you bring it to the justice system. It's not the definition of individual that's the problem. It's your philosophy that is the issue. In America men and women are treated equally. Period. It's the right thing to do AND it's the law, anything differently is illegal and can be persecuted in the court of law. What people do in their personal lives is their business.

And as to the angry women, if you think of Scandinavia for example, then all men and women must be angry over there, because most of them are feminists who work on many issues regarding equality (in fact on every government level, as well as in the business sector)... My husband is a swede, he is a feminist, his friends are feminists, my friends are feminist, and we are all average people with different political views and backgrounds. Here, people are so proud to work for equality and against \textbf{sexism}. Even my russian, soviet-raised mother has become a feminist while living here. We are all a hopeful and happy bunch. I have not, in all honesty met a person here that says "I'm not a feminist!".

But when the surprise happens, they are very sure they were very clear about it from the start. This actually happens in marriages, not only in boyfriend-girlfriend relationships. Where I live, people often get married and live without children for quite a long time. They travel together and do this and that, and then they, despite protection, sometimes get pregnant. Many of the quotes I used are actually from couples like that. One of them belong to myself (seven years together and we are over thirty), although luckily, it only was a pregnancy-scare. And there are also husbands pushing wives to abort a third or forth child because they are "tired", or were "looking forward to buy that new car". I know quite many of those stories, unfortunately. Women are often willing to rethink their family picture, when they realize they are pregnant. And they desperately seek support in their husbands. I know men that threatened to divorce, because "we can barely handle our two". What should a \textbf{woman} do? Suddenly divorce and become a single parent? I would, but not everybody would or could. I know of one man who actually bought that new car and moved to the french riviera, leaving his wife with now three children. The third, that she was brave to keep, was born with a severe handicap and she became completely alone and lost. It is the reality of our "humanity".\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/254 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.394 \\  \hline

My husband, a technician, is a proud feminist and is truly dedicated to make his area of work available and welcoming for women. He fights \textbf{sexism} and that often means taking a risk of correcting for example his boss. He is a feminist also in the way that he gladly will have an equal paternity leave (6 months), so I dont fall behind and dont loose more of my pension. He does the exact same work as me at home. I could go on and on. I just wanted to paint a different picture for you. My guy is almost an avarage guy for Sweden. A truly happy guy, I should point out in case anybody would think otherwise. And trust me I have seen and lived in a world that is the opposite of this and know the astounding difference, I am originally from Russia.

She can do it because our societies of men and women worked in different ways and fought so she can make that choice.
