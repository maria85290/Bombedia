\hline\cellcolor{green!27}\small You're a smart guy and very capable, it's obvious. I hate to say this, but what you're going through is normal. It happened to me - I was a VP and looked young and older people questioned me. Relax, you'll get through it. Sorry to lecture here, but there is \textbf{nothing} special about your experience in regards to being a capable, younger professional and you don't need to make a video about this experience(s). Just keep pushing through and you'll be successful. For example, Bill Gates was SUPER young when he started and people underestimated him all of the time, but he just blasted through it and was successful. You'll do awesome - keep positive.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!27}1/115 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.87 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small There are all kinds of "isms" out there, and unfortunately, there will always be these types of obstacles to overcome. But I think you handled it well. I'm 60, and my son recommended your videos to me. I'll say this. There are many people in your \textbf{age} category who don't have experience or are not driven to take the management of their own future into their own hands. They have become accustomed to having their parents or grandparents provide everything, which I believe is a dangerous thing for parents to do. I always taught my son how to make his own money and how to manage it and invest wisely. Very few parents do that. So you are a "rare bird". The people who are discriminating against you may just not have experience with such an accomplished, level-headed young man. Thank you for making these videos and the sound advice you give. I'm a fan.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/155 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.645 \\  \hline
