  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Annoncore1Thank you for replying to my comment. :)I am pleased to find a civil person to communicate with on YT.>"In the mean time if you ever find the true motive ,as in the end game for it all , please contact me a share your view , because that is the only piece of the equation I am missing ...."<AND>" it's only a round little ball floating in space ..."<That is a question for the philosophers and theologians!(I certainly am not one of those!)I don't have all of the answers; I don't think that anyone, any humanbeing has the answers for what have been massive changes in oursocieties in the past few decades. I too suspect that western societies elites have "upped the ante" (so to speak) and are attempting to bring about rapid changesin our societies; that they believe are beneficial to themselves.The importation of millions who will be a drain on the resourcesof the welfare state for generations is not something that favors native Europeans. And, in the end may not favor the elites, who have sought these changes (Maybe they, most of them, really do not understand the result of their actions) I respect Jordan Peterson for his intellect and his willingnessto share what he has learned with others. I also respect peoplelike Tommy Robinson who are defending their culture and heritage. Western civilization is, in my opinion, worth defending.Western civilization would not exist without Christianity or therise of city-states in Greece. Western civilization was synthesized by Greek philosophy and Christianity.Christianity and Islam would not exist without Judaism and the Roman empire. Rome had created the Pax Romana, the road systems, migration of people within the empire and toleranceof regional religions that became popular with people throughoutthe empire; as people migrated for trade.  This occurred slowly,over a period of centuries. In our \textbf{age}, we are experiencing rapid changes made possible by modern communications and transport. We as individuals. may or may not beable to adjust to the new realities; but our societies suffer because change is bewildering and (sometimes) painful.  Also, one has to decide what changes are beneficial for a society andwhat changes are detrimental for that society. Do we, as a species,have the wisdom to decide what is beneficial?  "Change" is a natural part of existence; \textbf{nothing} in this world is staticThe rapidity of change is what is the problem for most people. Slowlymoving changes to a society are barely noticeable to the average person.>"remember that the motive is more important then the mean."<Motive is more important than the mean to achieve a goal. The core motive for both organized religion and government is control of the realm and controlof the religious structure. Both involve control of the people.>"Catholic and Christian too have their fare share of dark \textbf{age} ,"< The so-called Dark Ages (which we, as moderns, refer mostly to Western Europe) were caused my many factors. Some of the same events that brought about thedark ages were climate-induced. Other areas of the world were affected as well as Western Europe by natural events such as volcanoes, earthquakes/tsunamis;and in some cases asteroid/meteorite bombardment of our planet.Scientists are just beginning to piece together changes in climate by analyzing ice cores from glaciers; sediment cores from oceans, seas, lakes and tree rings.Scientific knowledge is restrained by budgets (i.e. money available) and thepolitical situation where the the research is being conducted.Science has become so specialized that it takes  years of research, peer review and finally dissemination to percolate to the masses.It is time for me to say good-bye; I have rambled on enough ..... :pThank you for listening to me. :)\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}3/642 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.467 \\  \hline
