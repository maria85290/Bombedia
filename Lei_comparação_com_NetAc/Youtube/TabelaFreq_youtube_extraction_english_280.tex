And anyone — anyone at all — who tries to conflate antisemitism with falseness immediately loses credibility. Fox News pundits like Laura Ingraham and Tucker Carlson had, for a while, been earning credibility with rational commentary on Donald Trump, his allies, and his enemies, correctly observing that the right is usually right, while the left is usually wrong.

But when moral values  culture and fundamental mentality are on the table,  Westerners have \textbf{nothing} to do with the Jews.I will never ever support Muslims and their deadly cult, but I also will never ever trust the Jews. The fact I oppose Islam doesn't automatically lead me to support the Jews : they have deeply overwhelmed Western society through communism an ideology originating in Jewry, and now cultural communism. There is no way I will consider Soros, Madoff, Goldman-Sachs, the  Rothschilds, Barbara Spectre and their fellows as friends, and these are only the tip of the iceberg. Linda Sarsour and her community are for sure a clear and present danger to America as it is to the whole Western civilization, not to say the whole world. Only leftards could want her to speak on their behalf. Only them hate Western civilization so much they shamelessly shake hands with the Devil. More than Islam which  malicious nature we know,  it is liberals spinelessness that inspires loathing. They too are a direct threat to the West and it is all the most serious by the fact they are generally White Westerners themselves.PS : calling Linda Sarsour an anti Semite makes no sense : she herself is a Semite.

As a white, female conservative born in the 70's in a predominantly white community outside Chicago, I was raised that \textbf{black} is beautiful. In jr. high, every kid is school had pictures of Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston or Prince in their lockers.In High School, the "cool kids" wore MC Hammer pants, listened to rap. I would go to see movies simply because Eddie Murphy (must of watched Golden Child 100 x's!) Will Smith, Richard Pryor (easily one of the funniest men on Earth, God bless his soul) or Morgan Freeman were in them. (I honestly believe Morgan was in almost EVERY single movie in the 90's \& early 2000's! ;)Growing up EVERY kid HAD to watch The Cosby Show, A Different World, Different Strokes, 227, Martin, Living Color. I can STILL sing every word to the Jeffersons theme song to this day! Remember how cute Webster was? I do!I grew up listening to my dad's records of Lena Horn, Nina Simone gives me chills EVERYTIME I hear the soul in her voice. The first song we danced at our wedding was Nat King Cole.Toni Braxton \& Seal were a HUGE part of my late teens. Seeing Seal live was one of my all time favorite concerts.\textbf{Black} culture to me growing up \& now was always the COOL culture- \textbf{black} Americans were some of the farthest reaching descendants of our \textbf{Nation}. I raise my OWN children NOW that \textbf{black} IS beautiful \& to EVER judge someone simply by the color of their skin is ABHORRENT.I AM in the majority of white people thinking this way.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Let me explain my view another way and perhaps we can agree. We do have freedom of religion in America,  however,  Now, it appears amazing that we have rules in court house,  supper table, congress and so forth to remove your cowboy hats, ball caps, and such but now exactly how is our OUR SOCIETY supposed to accept and endorse someone sitting in a court room completely covered in a sheet except their eyes and it's not right for someone to remove their Maga cap or Stetson cowboy hat. Really, the point is the everyone wants to come to US but just for the land to abuse, deplete,  take away from and twist up everything we have as "the norm". So to me it's not at all the FOREIGNERS appreciate, want or even respect America. It's sad but they just want to WRECK IT. Can we ever find a happy balance living harmoniously amongst each other, accepting different cultures in our society WITHOUT UP ROOTING THE ENTIRE SYSTEM.
