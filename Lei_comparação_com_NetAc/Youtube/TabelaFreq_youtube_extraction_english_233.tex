This classification as a sub-group of Caucasian had \textbf{nothing} to do with skin color.

The Japanese also got some kind of honorary white recognition in apartheid South Africa after they got rich, so it is not even necessarily about colour as much as it is about the colour of your money ;-). It does not make much difference to me as an observer, but I am sure it is better than being categorised as \textbf{black}, so enjoy it, if not lobby for a new colour status, like with \textbf{sex}, how many categories are there for \textbf{sex} that just seem to have popped up over night.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The reason why Arabs or people of MENA decent are considered white is because when they first began immigrating here, which they have been immigrating here for only a little over 100 years (1870/90-now modern day) they were considered 'Syrians of Asiatic birth' because during this time 'Upper Syria' which consisted of modern day Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, and Palestine was apart of the Ottoman Empire. In the United States, the only way to be classified as 'white' was to be European. Now may I add, because for a long time, MENA people were considered 'Asian,' at this time white American people thought Asians were trying to steal their jobs. So the government created 'Anti-Asian Laws' which constricted immigration from East Asia (China and Japan) but it also affected people from the Middle East. Furthermore, immigration in the United States throughout history has only favored Northern and Western Europeans. While Southern and Eastern Europeans were discriminated against for not being considered white like Italians for example. So the immigrants of MENA decent community sued the government to be considered white and equal. They won; and ever since then we have been considered white. Now, the Middle East is a admixture of races and ethnicities. No \textbf{ethnicity} has one phenotype. They're are \textbf{black} Arabs, \textbf{black} Persians, \textbf{black} Turks. Just like there's olive complexed to brown Arabs, Persians, and Turks. There's also 'white' fair skinned people. This is all due to the fact, that the Middle East is the crossroads of the world. We sit in the middle of all of Asia, Africa, and Europe. So all those continents we will affect phenotypic features. The Middle East is unique in this aspect. Understand, 'white people' who are stereotypically 'racist' and white supremacists, are usually Anglo-Saxon and believe the Anglo-Saxon white \textbf{race} is the superior \textbf{race}. This is why Southern and Eastern European were discriminated against, because they're not Anglo-Saxon. However, after a certain amount of time coming from Europe, they were welcomed as 'white' but some were still discriminated against. MENA people in the United States, while on paper were called 'white' they're history in the United States is a long one of discrimination and not being welcomed by the average white American people. Being seen as too 'backwards, savage, and not quite white.' MENA people played a role in the Civil Rights Movement and were suffered from run-ins with the KKK. The sad truth is even though we were considered 'white,' like Italians and other Eastern and Southern Europeans, we were never quite welcomed like the other Europeans eventually became. Part of it is sure, on average MENA people may not look 'white' but even the fairer skinned MENA individuals were classified as inferior. Most people believe 9/11 was the upbringing of struggle for MENA people and Muslim community but our history in the United States hasn't necessarily been a welcoming, pleasant one. 9/11 was just the 'cherry on top' for our community to be further pushed and not welcomed.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Ethnicity, Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}6/498 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.205 \\  \hline

Me and my sister are white (in skin color) and my two younger brothers are very dark (Arabs \textbf{tan} really well), so what, are me and my sister a part of one \textbf{race} and my two brothers a part of a different \textbf{race}?

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small A history lesson  to all the fake neandertal  caucasian Arabs you are not Arabs you will never be Arabs All this modern fake Arabs are Caucasian. They certainly don't resemble the Arabs of Muhammed's (pbuh)time besides having many significant cultural differences. Real Arabs in Yemen, Eritrea, Somalia, Sudan, tribes are still \textbf{black} or near \textbf{black} in colour, the other fake Arabs are Syrians Turks or Iranians  Caucasians. The modern fake Arabians are not ancient \textbf{black} Arabians so what is the purpose lying about your identity when you put white on forms you are correct because you are Caucasians who hijacked the \textbf{black} Arabs identity. You have much more Slavic, Syrian, Turkish and Iranian ancestry then you do Arabian ancestry. The Quraysh and Kenani are still living in Hadromt  in Yemen, Ethiopia  Eritrea, Somalia, Sudan Israel. Do you even know what the Kenaani of the Hijaz still look like?Why the heck do you think so many Syrians  Turkic called the Canaanites and Nabataeans and other Arabs \textbf{black} and cursed throughout history. Or perhaps you are not aware of this! Is it because they looked like Syrians, Persians or Turks ?!IF you are an uneducated historically and have no knowledge of self, then you would do better to read real history and keep your  Aryanist worshipping, white-washed attitude to your stupid self. Better yet purge yourself of it and  fear of blackness because I don't want any real Arab darker than you to face your kind of negative energy and ignorance. One of the reasons I focus on this \textbf{black} stuff is because people like you around the world have been going around for centuries pretending to be more worthy of living than \textbf{black} skinned people who brought you your religion(s).If you don't know what the Arabs looked like and you are not aware of the many descriptions of the Azd and Quraysh and Canaani and in fact the Arabian tribes in general as being \textbf{black} and jet \textbf{black} in color and holding a fair skin in contempt -then it is your job to read about them and disprove it.You should at least attempt to disprove that the words 'shadeed al udma' and 'adam' and 'akhdar' meant people the color of a sub-Saharan Africans for Arab writers!. Disprove the 9th century king of grammarians al Mubarrad (otherwise known as Ibn Berry) of the Azd clan said the Arabs 'took pride in their blackness' and had a contempt for fair complexion because it was 'the color of slaves'. Disprove that 9th century al -Jahiz of Iraq claimed the Sulaym and all of the tribes of the volcanic region of el harra were '\textbf{black} as the lava' and taking white concubines. Disprove that al Dhahabi the Syrian of the 14th century who travelled through the Hijaz claimed that most in Arabs the Hejaz were 'dark brown' in colour and that they considered fair skin synonymous with the colour of slaves of Persians and Syrians. Disprove that the European colonialists visiting the Kaa'b, Uqayl and Khaza'il other tribes of Beni Amer ibn Za'za'a from Hawazin bin Mansur claimed that they were 'near \textbf{black}' and the complexion of Oromo Ethiopians and wore greased plaits in their hair like SO MANY OTHER ARABIANS. Disprove that ibn Athir the Kurd didn't claim the Sulaym ibn Mansur was of extreme blackness because they were from ' pure Arabs'. Disprove that tribes like the modern Anayzah and Shammar originally from Yemen settled among the white Syrians and mixed with them and then move back into Saudi Arabia after the 16th century. Disprove that the individuals in the gulf from aristocratic families have last names al Turki and Al Farsi because they are descended in part from Turks and Iranians in recent times. Disprove that Saudis were not enslaving and trading in women from Armenia, Georgia and the Caucasus and passing them around up until the 1960s.

Disprove that several Syrian and Iraqi scholars called the Khazraj and Aus of the Ansar descendants of the Azd extremely \textbf{black}, tall and 'huge with \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} eyes' and 'nappy hair' and that one of their leaders Ubada bin Samit of the Salim bin Auf clan of the Khazraj did not say that he would bring in thousands of tribal brethren with him into Egypt \textbf{black} as himself when speaking to the Byzantine '\textbf{r\textbf{ed}}' compexioned Copt in Egypt who feared Ubadah's appearance. Disprove that the Arab linguists did not say in their texts that the words white, green \textbf{y\textbf{e\textbf{llow}}} and \textbf{black} were used by the Arabs only for \textbf{black} men or \textbf{black} men whose complexion was brownish enough to see that that it was free of blotchiness.Disprove that early physical anthropologists found the early inhabitants of Arabia to be similar to those of East Africans and people of Nubia.And, disprove that the culture of ancient Southern Arabia was not closely linked to that o f the Horn of Africa and Nubia according to modern archeology.When you or a single on of the billions of people on this plane have disproved a single one of these facts Husayn then I will say you have made your case.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}African, Black, Red, Yellow & \cellcolor{green!27} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Ethnicity - Asian (East- China, Japan, Korea, Philippines, Vietnam), Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - Native-American, Nationality - Chinese, Nationality - Japanese & \cellcolor{green!27}22/1098 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.004 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small To those who don't know. Arabs are classified as a \textbf{nation}. A \textbf{nation} usually has many mixed races and split up into many regions. Important tip; There is East and Middle and West as parts of the Arab World. Which is mainly the Middle East is the center point of the Arab World. The skin color varies from white to \textbf{tan} to \textbf{black} and these people are basically Arabs. You have to understand that the Middle East is the \textbf{transition} point in between the West and the East and the North Africans. Being in the center you have access to all the nations easier than the rest of the neighbors. So for many thousands of years the Arab World has been interacting with the rest of the region. You would be surprised, to see and hear a blonde with blue eyes who is an Arab and speaks Arabic fluently. You would also be surprised to see and hear a North \textbf{African} who looks completely brown skinned, who is an Arab and speaks Arabic fluently. Found in counties like (Sudan, Libya, Somalia, Morocco) In the continent of Africa.   You would also see an Arab person who has the features of an east European who looks more likely, Turkish, Italian, Greek, Belgium ... and those Arabs are located right in the center of the Middle East like Lebanon, Syria, Palestine. In the continent of West Asia. You would also see the typical dark skinned Arabs but not too dark like an \textbf{African}, the features are not \textbf{African} more close to \textbf{Indian} . And they are found in countries like (Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Iraq) These countries are in the east continent of Asia.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African, Black, Indian, Nation, Tan, Transition & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - Native-American, Nationality - British, Nationality - General, Sexual Identity - Transexuality & \cellcolor{green!5}9/281 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.203 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Good girl.  I noticed the official MENA category is stripped of Turks, Kurds, Europes Azeri, or Afghans. So with the peculiar exclusion of these neighbors, MENA is deceptively just an ARAB category, however, the term "Middle-East-North \textbf{African}, gives the impression it represents a greater racial-cultural sphere.  So when they designed MENA based on self-response of different groups, t's easy to imagine how Israelis and Iranians felt coerced into selecting MENA over WHITE or OTHER, as they imagined it to be some generalization of the greater Middle East.  Johnny Tehranian and Morad Ghorban, charlatans, who pretend to serve deep Iranian interests, did absolutely \textbf{nothing} to appeal this fact, at the 2015 Census Bureau meetings. And keep in mind, checking MENA will not make your life easier.  First of all, Iranians are not exactly the type to milk public welfare anyway (with household incomes twice that of Americans), and nowadays Federal laws protect all citizens against racial/ethnic discrimination, so an oppressive level of discrimination (ie; severe employment discrimination to the point of bankruptcy) is completely unrealistic; in other words, their will never be a Federal budget to provide a significant MENA welfare to Iranians and others in the MENA category anyways-  it won't be necessary. The only thing checking MENA does is conform to backwoods ideology, that Iranians belong with Arabs.  You are right with respect to Iranian genetic affiliation, as revealed by this high resolution, 1 Million SNP, PCA with global populations:   [LINK] It's clear that Iranians true nearest relatives are people of Turkey, Azeris of Europe, and to a lesser extent Armenians.  Iranians are just an extension of the Caucaus groups, and on a continuous cline from Europe - so Iranians are genetically white, though at the threshold of whiteness, where eyeballing 'whiteness' is doomed to fail.   Perhaps,  it's fairer to say the modal Iranian type is white, because Iran is diverse enough and introduced a lot of foreign elements among individuals, so that there are quite a few outliers (like the one circled in \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} on that PCA).\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}African, Nothing, Red & \cellcolor{green!27} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - Native-American & \cellcolor{green!27}4/339 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.18 \\  \hline

There are arabs that have \textbf{african} blood mixed but there africans with arab blood aswell like ethiopians and somalians just look  at the features ..etc.Second there are 12 countries in Africa that are Arab. Not all of Africa is \textbf{black} or labeled as \textbf{black}! Third we are not white. The only reason they make us check white and this is a fact is because first arab settlers in America were from Lebanese decent which from all the arabs they tend to look more white with smaller features so they didn't know what to label them so they decided white. Look at the ancient Egyptians they were not \textbf{black} they looked just arabs from the gulf. That's why to this day they can't determine what \textbf{race} they would have been. They features are distinctive with sharp noses and big eyes with slender jaw lines. So you can not say blackforparents when in reality the continent of Africa is not like I said all \textbf{black}.

Some European genetics are also negligible and came in waves for thousands of years. But the core population, which has been there for 40,000 to 50,000 years, came via a back migration from Eurasia (and carried Neanderthal DNA). Also, the most comprehensive study on 16 ancient Egyptian mummies revealed that all of them were most closely related to populations of modern day Jordan and Syria.

Notice how all the tall bridged nose,huge eyes,\textbf{colored} eyes and hair and sharp features are all placed under "Caucasian" even though Arabs look \textbf{nothing} like white Europeans.

I'm not sure where you're from or where you get your sources but almost anyone here would still consider someone White if they were born/raised in the Middle East even if they adopted the Arab culture then it really doesn't mean anything. Arab/semitic is simply not a \textbf{race} and can't be separated "racially" based on cultural and \textbf{ethnic} differences. In conclusion, it should be noted that if they can trace their lineage back to Europe they've always been White.

Arab Americans have suffered discrimination, but overall, Arab Americans do extremely well in this country.

But even Arabs from the Arabian Peninsula are Caucasian, as are Persians, Kurds, Turks, and North Indians. \textbf{Race} is about skull and bone structure far more than it is about skin color. Also, \textbf{race} is completely different from culture and religion. I guess that's why a lot of Arabs don't understand that they are Caucasian...due to them having a different culture.

Science/technology was a choice by man imposed upon humans whether they agreed with it or not. The facts are that science/technology is a man-made concept that was not even necessary or a requirement. With that said, nature/natural systems not designed by human hands is not partial towards anyone nor does it discriminate against anyone, it gives or has the ability to give to everyone without the need of human intervention. Now,  it's a fact that the activities of humans, whether good or bad affects the earth, all living organisms and their quality of life. Moreover, nature/natural systems not designed by humans presents the truth as is, it doesn't hide, cover up or conceal the truth from anyone, it is what it is! That's the beauty of nature/natural systems created by the Supreme God, it's infinite and has the ability to defeat mere human philosophy and eventually will put an end to the acts of evil humans and their technology. Furthermore, all humans have free will or freedom of choice, it will be their own decisions of how the use their free will that will decide their fate and they will face the consequences of their actions.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I was wondering the same thing. Why do they cover their hair, yet wear tight jeans and put makeup on?? I am a Christian Middle Eastern and do not mind if we get our own \textbf{race} on the consensus, as long as the box says middle eastern, not ARAB. Being able to check white didn't make me feel privileged at all. In fact, I experienced a bit of \textbf{racism} in America from people who are close-minded. Although, I look white I do have an accent when speaking English. Arabic on my resume is not helping at all and many employers reject my resume because of this. They would think I am a Muslim just because my first language is Arabic. I am against any kind of discrimination. Our heritage does not go back to the arab tribes of arabia who happen to be a bit darker skinned. We consider ourselves to be Christians who descend from the people of Jesus Christ who used to make up the majority of the levantine region, until the muslim arabs took over and stole our land and abolished our language and culture.

I also want to add if you want to go by the Biblical definition of heritages and decedents then ALL Middle Easterners are decedents of Ham just like Africans and East Asians. Genesis chapter 10 will show in details where all human decedents came from. Europeans are decedents of Japheth, and Jews are decedent of Shem (that's why they're called Semites). Prior to the 1800s, the Middle East used to be called, Greater Africa. There is a reason why the Middle East has more in \textbf{common} with Africa than it does with Europe, from the climate, to the language, cultures, plants, animals, etc. But, i understand why you want to be classified as "white." Since there is an immense amount of privilege that comes with being classified as white. However, you're getting your wake up call, more and more white people don't consider you one of their people.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small ü§£ü§£ the natives of North Africa  are Amazigh Berber, they range from light skinned to tanned olive skin. It's insane how these \textbf{African} Americans and Africans in the west deny their Western \textbf{African} roots and try to claim they are Moroccans, Egyptian, hebrews and Greek LOL, they can't be all cos each has a distinct tracebale genetic marker. Morocco is 70-80 north \textbf{African} DNA, with a bit of middle eastern, Iberian and  sub-sahran. The DOMINANT DNA is north \textbf{African} Amazigh and their DNA is the oldest native genetic marker in North africa. No continent has one color or \textbf{ethnicity}. Northern Africans are separated from Sub saharan Africans by the SAHARA desreret, the harshest wide desert in the world,  separate people with different climates. FYI color melanin is product of climate. North Africa is Mediterranean climate, so we don't need high melanin. People away from equater are lighter due to climaye change and adaptation. Moreover, how could you deny DNA evidence of origin ?? Or are you another balck ashamed of you sub sahran \textbf{african} origon? Maybe because sub sahran didn't produce any notable civilizations? Do DNA test and see for yourself , it doesn't cost much, be honest. All countries around the medeterian sea have the same color, this include south France, south itlay, south Spain, Cyprus and Greece on the Europena side, , then you have North Africans , Turkey and Levant on the southern side. Just open your map really, they are closer to us than we are close to sub sahran geographically.  We are much closer to each other due to geography,  climate and shared history. DNA doesn't lie. We can trace the location of each DNA and the first inhabitants. Northern Africans have native Amazigh DNA.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African, Ethnicity & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}6/290 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.069 \\  \hline
