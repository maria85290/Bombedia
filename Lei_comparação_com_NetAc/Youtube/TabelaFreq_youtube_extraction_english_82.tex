  \cellcolor{green!5}\small That's because of that extra large NO gene every \textbf{woman} has buried in her neck. When I 'm aroused, I damn well know it. Women on the other hand, don't have a clue.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small May I remind you all that we are in the middle of the MeToo Movement and everything, no matter how insignificant, is considered \textbf{sexual} harassment and \textbf{sexual} assault.  Things like touching a woman's knee, caressing a woman's shoulder,  even an eye twitch is being equated with rape.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I always find it funny that women are OK with saying they want a tall guy.  But if men say they want a \textbf{woman} with big breasts then they call us \textbf{pigs}, or tell us that it shouldn't matter.  Thing is, both height and breast size are both physical traits, why is one OK but the other isn't????  Now, not EVERY guy wants a busty \textbf{woman} just like not EVERY \textbf{woman} requires a tall guy.  But on average each like what they like, and it doesn't make either \textbf{gender} a pig for wanting what they want.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Spartan \textbf{Freak} I never said anything about "catcalling" or anything like that.  When you talk about catcalling you're adding something.  But I will tell you, women DO in fact catcall men.  I've seen it and experienced it in my younger days when running with a buddy of mine in the summer (we were both shirtless).  It may not have been exclusively for being tall but it did happen.  We were both college football players.  None of that addresses how women think \textbf{nothing} of excluding men due to their "lack of height" or the fact that women think \textbf{nothing} of voicing that.  "he's not tall enough" "he's too short".  But if a man said that about breast size we would be labeled as "\textbf{pigs}" or any number of things.  I'll say it again.  Height and breast size are both physical traits....why should women get a pass when it comes to desiring a tall guy but men are put down if we like larger breasts??? This obviously don't go for all women or men, but there is a great deal of truth to it for each on average.
