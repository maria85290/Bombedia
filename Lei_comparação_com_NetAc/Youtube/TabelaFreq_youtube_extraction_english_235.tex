  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The economic right of a \textbf{woman} was denied before Islam and continued to be denied in secular cultures after it, only being awarded to women as late as this century. However, over 14 centuries ago, Islam gives the women right to personal ownership and wealth. Islam gives them the right of inheritence whereas in some cultures, women are considered objects to be inherited. Without her, the future generation would lack the healthy moral conscience that is needed for success and stability of any individual and community. Professionalism, hard work and loving commitment are the natural skills that a \textbf{woman} as a mother, imparts. However Muslim women are free to pursue employment if they are able to, and with the agreement of their husbands if married. History is witness to Muslim women's contribution to civilisation in various professions such as teaching, medicine and other fields. Paradise lies at the feet of their mothers.

On the other hand such evil practices happen under Islam.\textbf{Quran} teaches hatred and violence and commands Muslims to kill non believers and Infidels.This is the reason the Arabs have no respect for other people and races and dehumanize people who are not Muslims.It's clear therefore that the Jewish/Christian God is not the same as the Islamic Allah.Islamic Allah is false god, he teaches you to kill non believers.

You have to respect all human being and specially be good to the poor. Pay them in time, be good to them, provide them with proper food, do not make them work extra hours than what is promised and treat them with dignity. Please do not be a bad example for the whole community. If Allah s.w.t. has blessed you with wealth than be kind and benevolent to every human being regardless of \textbf{ethnicity} or religion. Please, Please my brothers how can you be so cruel to human beings. Allah s.w.t. created you and created them too so learn to be merciful. If you continue to be cruel to people under your employment you will face Allah s.w.t. and you will not be able to enter Jannah. I am a Muslim and totally condemn anyone who behaves like this with poor people. The Prophet s.a.w. said an Arab is not superior to a non Arab and a non Arab is not superior to an Arab. Brothers fear Allah s.w.t. and be merciful and don't take advantage of these poor people who have families back home to take care of. Being good to another human being is also a Sadaqah e Jariya. If you cannot be good to them let them go free. We are Ummat-e-Nabi s.a.w. we can only be merciful and just. Please be good human beings that they may be impressed with your Akhlaq and come towards the deen. All praise be to Allah s.w.t.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/280 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.357 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small KhalidA GOD bless you and your family.  Yes there are wonderful Qatar families. I have had the honor of treating them when they come to the United States for surgeries.  Even though Qatari physician are totally equipped to do surgeries, their government used to offer to them Qatar or the United States.  I have encountered some nasty people throughout the Middle East, but I cannot condemn people because someone with the same culture mistreated us.  A Qatari family once told me that they hid the maid from next door. She ran to our house, because she was friends with their maid and the daughters. She confided in them that the master in the house used to rape her, and when his boys got \textbf{old} enough they raped her too.  They used to beat her in the middle of the night and the neighbors would hear it.  They would call the police, but \textbf{nothing} was done.  When she ran away she hid in their house in their daughters bed room.  They were very well connected and they got her passport back from immigration and they sent her back to the Philippines.  She now works in Beirut, and her family takes her with them to London in the summer, while the kids are in camp.  She even went to Paris on the weekends with the mother.  They buy her lots of things, but when they travel to other countries they cannot take her because they have to get her visas which take forever.   She always thanks the Qatari family that saved her.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nothing, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}2/260 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.769 \\  \hline
