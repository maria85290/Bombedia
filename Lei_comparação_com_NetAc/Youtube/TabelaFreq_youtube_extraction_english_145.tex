  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I had a guy I liked, who wanted to be with me, where the only real "thing" that was driving him (not me) was if we had good \textbf{sex}. He said "well guys meet each other and have \textbf{sex}, and if it is god, they keep having \textbf{sex}, ad then they become boyfriends.  In Los Angeles, it is very transient, people then to come and go, literally, so being a native, it is hard to know what to do. Where to go. Or how to actually bond - again, only a \textbf{sexual} bond seems to be the allure here. AND even when you find that, it is no t uncommon to have the "other" say, after some great \textbf{sex}, as I heard, after a month of I am looking for a relationship, that in fact the :other" already had a relationship, who went back to the mid west to work in the beer family enterprise, saying "I just wanted to see if I could have an open relationship" so ... sincere guys tend to get **** over here.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I have noticed that when I was in my 30s, there were always a lot of young guys who wanted me. But when I was 20-25, I remember that I mainly attracted older guys. It´s kind of strage, I think. I was surprised, when I was 33-34-35 years \textbf{old}, that whereever I came in the \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} community, there were always some 20 or 23 yo guy interested in me. Maybe because when you are in your 30s you still look good, but you have more knowledge and are maybe more openminded and easier to talk with than when you are 20-25.But now where I am in my 40s, I am starting to notice that it´s harder to attract young guys from 20-30. Maybe the \textbf{age} gap is becoming too big. But on the other hand, I stil find a lot of 50-60 \textbf{old} guys who chase me all the time LOL\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Gay, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Sexual Identity - General, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality & \cellcolor{green!5}5/151 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.311 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I'll be 32 this summer and I would date, as you said, someone 5 years older/younger than I ! I also agree with the daddy/son dynamic however there's more to a relationship than \textbf{sex} yet that seems to be the sole driving force for some. I also see some people dating older guys for financial gain/out of convenience!  However, there are very mature 20 somethings and some very immature 40+ somethings ! Date someone that you're compatible with and be realistic as we all have flaws !!  NONE of us are perfect !!

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I honestly want my \textbf{age} or within 5 years older. I do not want to be the older one haha or super young in comparison. I don't understand why people wouldn't want someone there \textbf{age}.  I need love and emotions more then I need \textbf{sex}. Such a foreign concept in the \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} community. I know you asked for guys in there "30's" but I'm 29 so close enough. Oh and I date no one cause even with short hair I get mistaken for a \textbf{woman} or trans so \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} men don't even look at me. I don't know why bi men don't either.... guess I'm unlucky in love.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Haa as if \textbf{ageism} is the only problem. Certainly not the problem I've ever run into. Guys tend to want all the same thing yet none of them fit into that thing or at least majority don't. There's so much \textbf{racism} and prejudice in the \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} community its sick. I am 29. Me personally I want someone my \textbf{age} or older but not more then 10 years older preferably. Not cause I'm \textbf{ageist}, but I want to get married and to grow \textbf{old} with someone not have them already be much older and die way before me. I feel as if I am only going to be so lucky to find one person I wouldn't want to live 15-20 years longer then the person I was with and be alone. That's me personally. I've liked people over 20 years older then me I've liked people11 years younger then me, but it was to much of a gap for me.I want to date guys in there 30's. Well I don't want to date plural. I just want 1 man to fall in love with me date me then one of us proposes and we have kids and live happily ever after haha\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Ageism, Ageist, Gay, Old, Racism & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - General, Sexual Identity - General, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality & \cellcolor{green!5}7/202 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.465 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I am turning 30 this year. I would date guys in their thirties if there were open to dating me. I am not really interested in ppl in their twenties.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Folks have a general idea of the kind of people they attract. I tend to attract older men in their 40s \& 50s. I struggle attracting guys that are in my \textbf{age} range (30s). I recognized that it's the vibe one puts out or they can sense that you want a relationship. It's always the opposite effect. If you don't want something, you'll get it anyway. If you want something, you won't get it.  However, if you're looking for a significant other, you may have to readjust your preferences. Our preferences is what's causing \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} men to miss out on the opportunities to date and possibly be in a relationship. If you want a relationship, you may have to seek an older man. Or, find a guy that share the same interests and go from there. It's difficult when you're an individual that's self-aware and finding someone that is a compliment on both sides.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Gay & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Sexual Identity - General, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality & \cellcolor{green!5}3/154 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.948 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I think there's \textbf{ageism}, \textbf{racism}, \textbf{sexism}, \textbf{misogyny} and prejudice within the \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} community. So when people say the "\textbf{g\textbf{ay}} lifestyle" that's ignorant because \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} people are not monoliths. There's \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} conservatives, liberals, and people who don't fit either aforementioned label. There are just people who hold prejudices, so it's not a \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} thing, it's an ignorant thing because I can point to examples of straight people holding the same prejudices.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Ageism, Gay, Misogyny, Racism, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General, Sexual Identity - General, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality & \cellcolor{green!27}14/70 & \cellcolor{green!27}20.0 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I'm 25 currently and while I'm not in the \textbf{age} range you're talking about, I have thought about this myself. Speaking for myself, I don't mind guys in their 30s because I genuinely believe that older men (and 30 isn't \textbf{old} in my opinion) can look great and I feel that older men know what they're looking for and are more open to actual relationships instead of constant hookups. I know that there are older men who want to play the bachelor life until they can't get it up anymore but typically, I find that older men are more open to settling down compared to younger guys.I don't attract many guys to begin with but I've noticed all too often that a lot of younger guys are only interested in hooking up as much as they can because you know, sowing the oats and whatnot. This in turn can turn off some young guys who actually want to have a relationship and thus, they may open up to older men because like I mentioned earlier, they tend to be more susceptible and open to relationships. But I also agree that it's important to have some things in \textbf{common} with. I have met with a few guys significantly older than me (55 when I was 19) and the one glaring thing I've noticed is we couldn't connect on a personal basis. We both grew up at different times and different things were trending. Like for example animation, something I'm really into. He's into the cartoons that came out of the 1950s-1970s and I'm more into the stuff that came out in the late 1980s to the 2000s. Same with music. He liked Classic rock, I like 90s Alt Rock/Grunge lol So like you, ideally I'd like to find someone within my \textbf{age}. 5, maybe 10 years give or take.Back on the topic at hand, I do think that top/bottom can play into this as well. I've heard and seen time and again of older more dominant men trying to get younger guys and vice versa. I think it's the guys who are more versatile-minded that don't do this as much. Anyway just my own 2 cents.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Common, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}4/367 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.09 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small AGE!!!!  20's, 30's oh my god 40's!!!!  You guys are so \textbf{age}-phobic.  Sure youth is beautiful and that's what we all think we want, but I don't really remember \textbf{ageism} talked about that much when my husband and I were young.We were both concert pianists and met at Juilliard School of Music when we were both 21.  We fell in love quickly and have been together since then.  That was 1963 - eeks - how \textbf{old}.......lmao.  We are now 75 and have been together for 54 years! As you can see from our picture we were both extremely handsome.  However really hot \textbf{sex} lasted about 20 years.  Thank god we loved each other from the beginning because that has lasted and will until we die.  Maybe I'll write about being \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} in the 60's and in love.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Ageism, Gay, Old, Sex & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Gender - General, Sexual Identity - General, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality & \cellcolor{green!5}6/138 & \cellcolor{green!5}4.348 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I'm 23 and I'm totally fine with dating guys in their 30's. I find them physically attractive, and I like how they typically know what they want in life and who they are, as opposed to guys more my \textbf{age} who are still figuring themselves out.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/46 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.174 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I am in my 40s and I find that this is a difficult \textbf{age} to find partners. I am too \textbf{old} to be young and too young to be mature LOL. People in their 50s og 60s can attract guys who want a daddy or a mature guy. While people in their 20s or 30s can attract guys who want a boyish or young looking type. When you are in your 40´s, you can´t attract those who want young guys and you can´t attract those who want a mature guy...\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}2/90 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.222 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I'm 33 and I have the same \textbf{age} range as you that I''m most likely to be interested in, but if the right guy came a long I would be open to it being outside of that range. Currently I just started seeing a guy 1 year younger than me, but my last relationship was with someone 6 years younger than me and it was precisely because we were compatible intellectually, thought each other were cute, and then \textbf{sex} compatibility developed. we broke up because we were just at different stages and needed to be open to moving away and we would be moving in different directions. our relationship lasted 2 years, 4 years later we are good friends. So that was just an \textbf{age} gap, in an otherwise normal relationship. I haven't encountered all these 30 year olds who are only into younger guys and aren't into guys their \textbf{age} yet but I agree with Bloopity Bloop, it's probably just something that happens\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Sex & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}4/164 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.439 \\  \hline

\item The percentage of hate speech related words is 2.6349.

\item Considering that the variable \textbf{Age - General} has the most occurences in the post, we can interpret that this is the predominant hate speech.

\item Overall there were 66/27 occurences of hate speech related comments.\end{itemize}\end{document}
