\hline\cellcolor{green!27}\small This is a very accurate video. Older people are definitely pushed out of and not even considered for most jobs. Some of that is valid, as an older person you generally are not as up to the demands of a hard physical job. Also as an older person many of us are not as fast mentally as we used to be and can lose some memory ability. Having admitted older people have some downsides, it is my experience that most of the job bias is just pure predjudice. You only need to read the comments on this video to see how bad it is and how acceptable it is to demonize anyone who is in the 50 and older class. It is truly amazing to me how little the next generation understands the past and how much they seem to blame and hate their parents \textbf{age} group for things that are occuring now. Take today's young and put them where we were 35 years ago and very little would change but in those younger minds it's all about how selfish and stupid we boomers were and how we left \textbf{nothing} for them.  It will be truly interesting if as they \textbf{age} they grow out of this distorted view of their parents history. I suspect that they will as we the now aged boomers did  with our parents.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!27}3/227 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.322 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Unfortunate for the speaker and the sympathizers, this is a phenomenon only in the West. Probably a bigger issues specifically the USA. I will never understand why ppl over there resist soo much being an \textbf{old} person. I mean what's the point in living without accepting facts. I may be young today but I'm pretty accepting of the fact that I will be \textbf{old}, as long as I do not die before I do. Yes we should sympathize with their issues but you can't sympathize and be understanding yet get told that you are being offensive. This is somewhat true with \textbf{gender} issues as well. The facts are, \textbf{old} ppl are weaker and lack motor skills in general\textbf{Old} do not look the same as when they are young. Which is a superficial thing especially at that \textbf{age}.The \textbf{old} really do need to prioritize the young. It's an evolutionary instinct for a reason.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Gender, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}7/154 & \cellcolor{green!5}4.545 \\  \hline

Younger people eventually bounced back but not your middle aged who are now \textbf{old} because lets face it almost no company ever hires older workers when they can get cheaper and younger ones.

They brainwash a percentage of the up-and-coming generation in order to keep things the same and retain their positions of power both socially and economically.They sacrifice the future for their own petty greed.The \textbf{old} perceive My Generation as a threat to their power.The fact that we live as long as we do is one of the heaviest contributing factors of what is debilitating or stagnating evolution and our ability to adapt.Holding onto culture and traditional values it's something that the \textbf{old} love to do and then there's the whole respect your elders bullshit while our elders piss all over us.in a desperate culture War, which is \textbf{nothing} more than evidence for Divergence in our species, these \textbf{old} farts punish anybody who dares to step out of line or refuses to respect their bullshit Authority.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Nothing, Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!27}7/225 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.111 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small This may sound hard but if you lose your job maybe you've become incompetent or picked the wrong employer. Also get another job that may pay you less. Contributing to a 401k instead of counting on social security is a responsible thing to do. Selling things and living within your means. Youths won't get social security even though we pay for it and you want to tax more to make it more luxurious? I'm making sacrifices while I'm young so that I'm not a burden on others. Maybe they should have to.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Jacques Nel The Boomer generation, in less than fifty years, turned the most powerful country ever known to man (the United States after World War II, the only \textbf{nation} with its modern infrastructure intact) into a corporation-controlled, massively indebted, 25th-ranked in education, shell of itself.Their treachery won't be dismissed as "people make mistakes".\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nation & \cellcolor{green!5}Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/54 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.852 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small She keeps proving that anyone to throw around "-isms" doesn't have a good argument for whatever shit they want to peddle. And whatever happened to "power+privilege" noise? Why is a generation with so much money and power being sheltered from any negativity by demonizing everyone who dislikes them for good reasons with "muh -isms"?Boomers are hated by everyone after them because they hate everyone who came after them. Boomers are incredibly selfish, and go out of their way to rod their children/grandchildren of their future, by continuing to push for laws that benefit only boomers, or laws that they won't be alive to face the negative consequences for, like any law that is pushed to deny global warning, or to "own the libs". You can't eat your cake, and have it, too, boomers. Either continue being selfish pieces of shit, and accept being called out as selfish pieces of shit, or realize that hate doesn't come because "lazy millennials" are bored and picking on poor \textbf{old} boomer, poor \textbf{old} boomers with all the power and influence, to entertain themselves, or just because millennials are big meanies.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}2/187 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.07 \\  \hline

Two incomes creates more buying power, which causes higher prices in a competitive bidding market (i.e. real estate).  The home I was born in now lists for four times what my parents sold it for, that's an insane rate of inflation.  Single-earner families, which used to be the norm for the middle class, are now the purview of the elite (top earners) and the impoverished (regular and low earners).  To be middle class now requires two average wages.  That's not sexist, because married \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} men still need two incomes to buy a home.And stop molesting potatoes, and YouTube commentators against their consent.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gay & \cellcolor{green!5}Sexual Identity - General, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality & \cellcolor{green!5}2/138 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.449 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Zenn Exile okay, so you're saying...The average worker has a lower hourly wage today than seventy years ago.This lower hourly wage allows people to buy more than seventy years ago.Neither men or women work in most households today.Families with two incomes have less buying power than families with one or no income.The home I was born in was not recently listed for four times what my parents sold it for.Most middle class families in the past had dual or no incomes, not single incomes.Most modern-day middle class families are single income homes.While heterosexual couples require two regular jobs to afford a home, \textbf{homosexual} couples can afford a similar home with one or fewer incomes.And you reserve the right to continue molesting potatoes.Ladies and Gentlemen: the opinions of Zenn Exile\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Homosexual & \cellcolor{green!27}Sexual Identity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/139 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.719 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The current prejudice against \textbf{old} people is two-fold: (1) The current generation of American \textbf{old} people are fundamentally responsible for mass immigration, the promotion of college to young people (and the debt associated with this), and the gutting of American resources to foreign countries and lobbies.  (2) The mass importation of immigrants creates intersectional feminism, which causes \textbf{old} Trump voters to be abused by young immigrants (and their descendants).\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}3/69 & \cellcolor{green!5}4.348 \\  \hline

\textbf{\Large Result analysis:}

\begin{itemize}\item Taking into account the words that were detected, we can reach the conclusion these comments are associated with : : Age - General;Age - Youngsters;Gender - General;Age - Over 65s;Ethnicity - Black;Nationality - General;Social Class - Working class;Ethnicity - General;Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments; Ideological and Political Identity - General;Physical Identity - Physical Features;Sexual Identity - General;Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality;%.

\item The percentage of hate speech related words is 1.7665.

\item Considering that the variable \textbf{Age - Over 65s} has the most occurences in the post, we can interpret that this is the predominant hate speech.

\item Overall there were 206/264 occurences of hate speech related comments.\end{itemize}\end{document}
