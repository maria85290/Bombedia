You pay by gram, ounce, quarter pound, pound, kilos (kg), etc. It's real measurements just like you would measure any other chemical substance. Trap lingo means drug talk. And \textbf{black} tar heroin is a form of thick heroin from Mexico. It has a thick consistency like butter because of the method of extraction.
