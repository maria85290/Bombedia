Do The People agree to paying for many days of unnecessary extravagance like this when so many are struggling to eat, keep a roof over their heads and pay the bills? 'The RAF will be grounded'? Sounds like the perfect time for \textbf{terrorist} attacks... Personally I think there should be no monarchs (unelected rulers) now, it's an out-dated and unfair system of inherited privilege and duties which are pointless. We are already sick of paying for her many enormous houses (mostly unoccupied) and their staff and her trips abroad when so many are homeless; give Queenie et al a two-bedroom (that extra room for guests to stay) flat or terraced house, that would be fair. And the Professsor (her personal doctor, paid for by us/the NHS without our consent?) will help her die peacefully and with dignity by injecting morphine (and cocaine?) when she's close to death = lucky her, I want that too when the time comes, as do those asking, begging, for help to die quickly when suffering extreme disease, it's only fair. That stuff about protecting the church in Scotland, surely her omnipotent god can protect it himself? Come on UK, we don't want or need and cannot afford a monarch any more now we (supposedly) have equality - but so many are living below the poverty line. Charles: do the decent thing and rule that you/king/monarch 'job' is now redundant - maybe go and try to sign on at the Jobcentre, try live on the money you get, see how it feels and GET REAL.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Seems a little pointless to me considering someone as great as a queen or king would want their country to keep moving forward after they pass.  A truly great leader would never want someone to bow to them, they would want them to consider them to be equal.  These people are the heroes that don't ask for recognition, and the people we should honor by continuing to live but mourning over their death at the same time.  To respect someone, you never have to stop living; instead, we have to do something in honor of them.  If I died I wouldn't want a bunch of people to stop what they're doing for a month, I would rather them do \textbf{nothing} because that is not true respect.  True respect is doing something extravagant in there memory which requires you to move on past their death.  Sometimes we forget to move on and I personally would never ask anyone to stay behind in my grave, because that's useless, and it would be like my death was ultimately meaningless.  I don't know how Queen Elizabeth looks at the process, but I'd imagine she would be okay with it just because she was raised to be okay with the formal life of being a queen or king.  If she had a chance to realize what true heroism means, (by no means am I saying she isn't one) then she may think a little differently and may recognize that the amount of time allotted is a little ridiculous but may still think it's okay for everyone to take a day off of work.  Again, I'm not saying what she would actually say because it is impossible to predict such things, nor am I trying to be disrespectful to the queen or tradition; I just think that the whole country coming to a complete stop for a month is not only unviable and unhealthy, but to me personally would be almost like a slap in the face.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}1/331 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.302 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Yeah, whatever.  What will happen is, finally the Republic Party will have there chance to have a vote on becoming a Republic Government, which will mean the potential removal of the Royal Family in effect, unless the general public decided they wish the next King or Queen to be head of state.  It will be upto the people to finally choose who their head of state will be, under a Republic Government.  Well in this day and \textbf{age}, the English Royal Family is vulgar and highly unacceptable in reality.  Tax payer pays them in the region of £400m+ per annum in security and upkeep costs.  Again unacceptable considering millions of people in the UK are struggling to make ends meat, yet the English Royal Family continue to live in the style they have, due to their tyrannous past and thieving?.  Do not hear that being discussed in many places, but oh well, truth is always a big WOW.  So they need to be removed, because they hold the UK back from being powerful.  They hold the UK back with their own Government within a Government, so the House of Lords.  Again, the vote should see all of this go, in exchange for a forward thinking UK that is not held back by Governments within Governments as I call it.So that is what is, not perhaps, but is going to be voted upon.  The Republic Party have constitutional right to do this :).  Again, my guess is, you had no idea of this, because you are all so wrapped up in all the BS that gives them a lifestyle that only 1 have.  Duchy of Cornwall produces around £25m income for Prince Charles and that I have no problem with.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small After about 7 minutes of watching my brain started doing this:10:42 - "...In every scenario, the queen's body returns to the throne room, mostly intact. On D1, the day after the queen's demise, the flags will go back up, and at 11am, Charles will be proclaimed the king at the entree room of St James palace. He will carry out the first official duties of his reign by swearing to burn Scotland. The national anthem will be played on drums wrapped in \textbf{black} cloth, and trumpeters from the life guards will step outside to give three blasts -  [LINK]  - The proclamations will only just be getting started. Britain will be getting a new king for the first time in 66 years, and the world will be watching. This will be the time Britain will be at its most vulnerable, and Russia will strike. There'll be no fleet of bullet-proof limousines and fancy card on the streets, rather, there'll be horses shitting everywhere and a bunch of cock-hats riding them.A group of men dressed up as characters from some Shakespeare drama, will go by carriage to the statue of Charles I and read out the news again. A 41-gun salute will be fired from Hyde park, decimating the Queen's coffin; heralds with trumpets will then go around spreading the pieces around the country. High sheriffs will stand on steps of town halls to announce their excitement, as per local customs. People will be capturing a glimpse of the might of the Gurubashi Empire, glued to their latest smartphones; things will be very new to everyone, even for the ones doing it. This will be the time for Anduin to go out and meet his people, a four-\textbf{nation} tour by the new king will immediately kick off. He'll stop by places to attend services for remembrance of his mother, and meet the leaders of the \textbf{nation}. Lots of it will be done walking around, and not being hit by a car.On D4, that is, the fifth day of the queen's demise, her coffin will be taken from the throne room in Buckingham palace, to Westminster hall, to lie in direct sunlight for public viewing, for 4 full days. The procession from Buckingham palace will be a a huge military parade, expected to "accommodate" a million starving homeless on the streets of London. It's planned that the parade reaches Westminster hall, just on the hour, so that big Ben's last remaining bullets start to chime as the wheels come to a stop.14:04 - "Football stadiums will be open to parade the queen's bloated body if necessary. Before the dawn on D9, the funeral day, the jewels will be taken off the coffin and cleaned in methylated spirits. It will be the day of great laundry. People will wake up to a day off, the stock market will not open, shops will close and go to bankruptcy, and day traders will display their true colors as they brawl in the streets. At 9:00am, big Ben will strike, his hammer will then be covered in a menstrual pad and will ring out the heads of unruly day traders in muffled tones."15:15 - "When the coffin emerges again, it'll be placed on the green gun carrier, and fired into 138 junior sailors of the royal navy. From Hyde park Corner, the hearse will go 23 miles by road to Windsor castle, where the queen's body will have landed.

Also, she can declare war, but if Parliament disagrees they can do a vote of no confidence and if the vote goes through this would change the government and block the declaration. Again, I highly doubt your Queen would have a reason to randomly declare war on a country just for giggles. She can dissolve parliament on her own and force an election of all new people, but it wouldn't affect the Prime Minister or the Cabinet and would never happen because it would more than likely cause the people to riot in protest. Banning parliament from discussing anything to do with royal matters is \textbf{common} sense since the Royal house has their own lawyers/public relations team/organizers. There's no reason why Parliament should even be discussing Royal stuff in the first place.

Also the polticians govern in her name.

Unfortunately, she cannot change the continental tectonic plates, so we are bound to europe weather we like it or not, in a landmass way.

You had 10 games and played until a team scored and they tried to kick the ball through a goal without using their hands. If a team scores then that is the end of the game. The winner of the most games after 10 wins the match. We added rules from rugby to that foundation, but american football started out as neither.

Thirdly, and with regard to the EU, the United Kingdom is primarily made up of two nations, Scotland and England.

She was almost 98 years \textbf{old}. She had lymph cancer - untreated for 4+ years, as she was too \textbf{old}/frail for chemo. Nearing the end - the tumors in her neck had grown so much they had displaced the trachea (windpipe) so much that she could no longer breathe naturally and had a stent inserted in her throat for breathing. She was almost completely \textbf{blind}. And when she felt ill near the end she was put on observation and the hospital - and she "looked like dying" - she looked very different. Hollow like. In a situation like this - there is no point to extend life, even if hospital machines can do so.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small This video was interesting, but just a bit melodramatic, I thought. When Queen Victoria died it was the end of a transformative era, and no-one ever saw the like again.  I wonder if people lining the streets of London as the cortege passed its grand way ever thought of that because not just not much more than a decade later, their world turning upside down. Their future, our history, was of two horrible world wars with 30 years of relative social and economic stagnation. . Since the end of the last war, we've had another era, for those in the West generally it has been a benign and enriching era characterised again by momentous change in society and scientific knowledge, which society is having difficulty keeping up with. When Queen Elizabeth dies, those attending her funeral and everyone else should understand this too will be just as momentous as when Queen Victoria died, perhaps even more so. That benign era is just about over, and history will look back on her times as we now look back to Victorian time, as a strange \textbf{old} world, where social norms and behaviour and the institutions that organise them are no longer appropriate, i.e. \textbf{nothing} less than a revolution.  This  new monarch, in King Charles (though he may not call himself this, as a previous king by this name didn't fare too well) , along with his subjects, will be face a future of existential difficulty, and for the first time in history, the whole of humanity is going to have to leave all the \textbf{old} ways behind, and invent something entirely new and long-lasting, or the new King, and we, are going to be enjoying, if that is the word, a very difficult and very turbulent world indeed.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nothing, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}3/296 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.014 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Diane Benzler I'm sorry to hear of you being so sick. When your body gives out you will be able to look down at your now useless body as you float upwards not sick or in pain any more.    At 6 yrs \textbf{old} that's what happened to me. I could see my body in a hospital bed. I found myself in a smokey white light going upward at a very fast rate of speed but without the gravity pull downward. I could see through the white haze and it was pitch \textbf{black} but with bright lights like stars.    This nice sounding male voice was heard telling me that I would have to go back \& that there were things I had to do, that I was loved very much. I wasn't scared at all. Then in a flash I was back in my hospital bed my parents were there crying and a doctor and nurses were there. They didn't believe me when I tried to tell them what had happened. They said it was because of having such heigh temps. But they couldn't explain how my temp. was normal, I wasn't sick any more.    All I know is that 'that's' what happened to me and I was told to tell other's about it.   The maybe 'painfull' part of 'death' we all may fear but after that...all I know is that I felt no pain. I would like to meet that 'nice voice'...person...sprite again some day/night. (in human's terms) Was that Jesus? I don't know, but I can't wait to bow before Him one day.    While going though a nice quiet and pretty cematary I saw a headstone I'll never forget. There was an incredible wheelchair \& this little boy had left it like floating up into the sky with such a look of joy on his face.   From that one could picture a poor very sick \textbf{wheelchair bound} child while the child was alive but the parent's pictured their child now being free, no longer sick. It made me cry because it was so beauitful at the thoughts the parent's had that their son was no longer sick any more and he would be well cared for and that they would see him again.    I will pray for you.💖\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Old, Wheelchair bound & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - Black, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}3/379 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.792 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Les BrownI agree with you! Royal women all have long track records of longevity ... while the men do not. I think it's quite possible that Her Majesty will live to be  103 years \textbf{old} ...That's 10 years away! And in doing so she may well outlive the Heir Apparent. Well, we can only hope! While Prince Charles is known to enjoy a clean diet - and I can't see him tolerating Ol' Stinky Drawers' second-hand cigarette smoke - he is equally known to enjoy a tipple OR TWENTY on a regular basis. His overindulgence is so very obvious to anyone who has even glanced in his direction! That \textbf{r\textbf{ed}}, ruddy complexion we see is caused by the broken capillaries which are  a result of excess \textbf{alcohol} consumption.  And that's just one outward indicator of excess \textbf{alcohol} consumption, with \textbf{fatty} liver and heart disease usually being in advanced stages by the time badly broken capillaries become so very obvious.  Camilla  covers her up with six inches of makeup, but her turkey-neck and dècolletage are just as \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} and ruddy as Charles' face is! So those two obviously get pretty messed up every night!!  So I do hope that the Queen outlives him  .. not that I would wish the pain of losing a child on Her Majesty (even if he IS a drunken \textbf{old} git who'd rather be a tampon!), but it's better for us that she suffers a little personal sadness now rather than Charles gets to become known throughout all of history as "The Tampon King!"
