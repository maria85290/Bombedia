  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Bitch what the fuck, first of all what did we even do? we are not even adults yet, lmao. And second of all, this is entirely incorrect, there is a reason why \textbf{old} people lecture younger people. It is because our grandparents grew up in a time where everyone was polluting the entire planet, and not giving a crap about it. The mistakes that they did teaches them wisdom and when they get kids or grandkids, they will teach their mistakes to the younger generation to not make the same mistake and fuck up the whole newer generation that way we wont get a nickname for ourselves. Yet, you a 'Gen Z' is completely trashing our own generation that was meant to be better than our last generations, and you entirely ruin that by giving out reasons why Gen Z is bad, when it was not really the Gen Z's problem, but the generation before them. And to be completely honest, you yourself is ruining our own generation by making people think that this generation sucks.

I know there are some \textbf{dumb}, uneducated, \textbf{crazy} and whatnot people out there, but you, my dear, DEAR rude shait of a person are one of the worse cases.We are all humans. Gen-Z is the first generation that was most fully born in the modern technological \textbf{age}. We were born when phones were already invented. Who were phones invented by? Baby Boomers! So don't you dare tell me something so rude, SO INSULTING like this! Don't you dare tell me we're bad people, while YOUR generation made us like this! If anything, YOUR generation is more at fault than ours! We didn't CHOOSE to come to life at this \textbf{age}! On the other hand, You guys were the generation that MADE us like this! You're the generation who constantly criticize US for something YOU have caused! Generations BEFORE Millenials and Gen-Z's has caused us to act like we do. If not, then tell me why are most of us younger people unmotivated?? Because people like YOU make us feel like SHAITS!! That's why! I don't want to insult any older generations or any younger generations, unlike this guy. I don't care about what generation you're from, but when you go out and PURPOSELY insult any other human being, that's when you've crossed the line of being a dumbass, to being a literal scum of the earth.

Personally, I love my brother, but living with very strict parents and being given harsh expectations, along with dealing with constant stress and anxiety has taken a large toll on my health both mentally, and emotionally.
