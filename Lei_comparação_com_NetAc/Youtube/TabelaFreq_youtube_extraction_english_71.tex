The men built this world, and you can't argue against that. It's just the nature of life.﻿ If you women think you are equal to men, then how come this world is dominated by men in almost every aspect of life?

All that men are to women are UTILITIES, "men are either EXPLOITED or IGNORED".We don't exist to women or society unless we have utility value, we are kept in a state of ignorance and anyone who tries to educate or warn men/boys is shamed into silence or threatened.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!27}1/105 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.952 \\  \hline

But that was the BEGINNING of time. This is the \textbf{age} of knowledge and understanding, a changing point. And you know women helped out in ancient and early civilizations than just gathering? Women helped fight off predators and obtain food, they helped their clans' migrate and move, shoot some even lead clans. But apart of ancient history, lets get back to our modern \textbf{age}. Women have just as much capability of men do. We are practically equal. Yes a few hormones and muscles may be justified but that doesn't make any significant changes. And if you think men always over power women, why don't we take a look at some of our historical women who've practically conquered men in both muscle and intelligence wise.

That's not very far from saying: That child is not my responsibility because it came from your body. Guys are often the ones that don't want kids, let them pay the price for that, imo it should be split 50/50 with your sexpartner. If you're the kind of girl to sleep around yeah, you should pay for your own contraception BUT if you're in a relationship it is ridiculous to let the \textbf{woman} take all the responsibility, you both don't want a baby? how about you both pay the price. Also: fuck those guys that tell women to use the pill just because they don't want to wear a rubber, it's been proven rubbers don't take away any of the feeling.. It is just plain bullshit and laziness. Personally i wouldn't want to get pregnant so i think the guy should have condoms at his house and i should have them at mine, if we get serious and i need to take birth-control pills we'll both pay for it 50/50 if he wants me to take them (because i'd rather not).\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/203 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.493 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@ironfallout  I am not agreeing with the fact that anyone should be paying for anyones contraception. I believe that all contraception should be affordable regardless of \textbf{gender}. With that said: Mens contraception is relatively cheap compared to women's. I have been on birth control since I was 13 because of cysts on my ovaries that could potentially grow and make me infertile, so birth control was prescribed to prevent them growing.At the beginning of every year my first prescription pack is not covered by insurance due to insurance renewal. The price is 92 dollars. for one pack, which happens to be the most generic and therefore least expensive option avalible. 92 dollars every month if insurance does not cover some of it, which it should since i pay money to them for that very reason. Again i dont agree with federal taxes covering it but something does need to be done, all though i have no idea nor opinions on how to make that happen.It is not that women feel more entitled than men to contraception,  it is that the only reliable forms are expensive for us and in many cases are also for our health, not necessarily \textbf{sex}.  without affordable birth control available to me i would not be able to have children and would have needed surgery to remove the cysts.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender, Sex & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/225 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.889 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small People need to stop disregarding the men's side of the story. When a man complains about the \textbf{sexism} and discrimination against his \textbf{sex}, us women do not need to downgrade their struggles just to prove that the discrimination towards us is "better" and more critical than theirs. We are all victims of the discrimination of media. It is true that women are more sexualized than men, but calling men out for complaining that there is not enough representation for the discrimination towards them is the total opposite of what the representation project is trying to achieve. Telling men that they do not have as much problems as us women is making it seem like the discrimination towards men is not important or non-exist, even though it so clearly does exist, and which is just as worse as saying that the discrimination towards women is a myth. Stop telling men that they are "overreacting" about their problems because that is just as sexist and discriminatory as if the comment was directed towards a \textbf{woman}.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Sex, Sexism, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/173 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.734 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I totally agree, people should just stop telling each other they're "overreacting" in general, it's unfair to say it to a \textbf{woman} and it's unfair to say it to a man. Men are the subject of \textbf{sexism} just as women are, one of the most painful things is that when a man get's raped people are not even remotely understanding, women getting raped is collectively seen as bad and we all know that now (even though in that area there can still be some improvement in the department of slutshaming and comments like "she was asking for it") but men being raped seems to be a confusing concept for people, if someone doesn't want to have \textbf{sex} but you push on anyway.. it's rape, no matter the \textbf{gender}.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender, Sex, Sexism, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}4/128 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.125 \\  \hline

How about we go deal with \textbf{sexual} oppression, honour rape and ACTUAL \textbf{misogyny} in countries that actually need it. countries where "\textbf{patriarchy}" means women legally cannot take a position of power, not shaving armpit double standards.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small You might want to read a little about rape culture.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@asdfboochica are you aware of the definition of the word "intersectional"? You might want to look up intersectional feminism, as you appear to have a very conditioned and narrow view of what feminism actually is.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@MasterOfTheChainsaw I disagree, and I'm right because I'm backed up by the definition of \textbf{sexism}. Unless one attacks a person based on their \textbf{gender}, it is not \textbf{sexism}. Plain and simple. Talking about a \textbf{woman}'s looks is not \textbf{sexism} because it does not bare relevance to the fact that she's a \textbf{woman}. So, I could insult every \textbf{woman} on earth by calling them ugly and comparing them to horses, yet this wouldn't be sexist because their \textbf{gender} was not used against them. \& I was talking about all physical activity. Boys of 16 outperform women of Olympic level, Kelly Holme's gold medal victory in the 400m was 4 seconds slower than the qualification to be in the men's 16 year \textbf{old} team lol kinda scary thought right? This is obviously why they separate the genders, women would rarely win anything otherwise, but hey, women can produce life. (amazing obviously) I also here people claiming hitting a \textbf{woman} is \textbf{sexism}. This kind of comment should put people into a \textbf{mental} asylum because it's absurd, unless, you're hitting women because they're women.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Yes, I agree with your definition of \textbf{sexism}, my point is that if a certain news program would consistently judge the looks of women but never men, it's a pretty strong indication that they are doing it BECAUSE THEY ARE WOMEN, which would mean they are specifically targeting people based on their \textbf{gender}, and as such it is \textbf{sexism}.Yeah, sure, men are physically superior in many ways. You could of course argue that there are still some ways women are physically superior, for instance by lacking the immense sensitivity of testicles.Just hitting a \textbf{woman} in itself is not sexist, like you say hitting women because they are women would be sexist, and once again if you find someone who consistently beat up women but never men it's a strong indication that they are doing it for sexist reasons.

So this is your thing, you just compile a bunch of clips, all of the mean things said to women that you could find, from all of politics on the entire Internet. You take them all out of context, so it's just one line of something someone says. Then mix in some tabloid covers, some bitchy tweets form some random columnist, and a few headlines from, uh, just some random dude's blog. Is that it really, this is your big YouTube campaign? Then, you just throw in any mention of appearance whether it's about a female politician or female journalist, whether it's positive or negative. That's not allowed either? None of it? Wow. Well hey, you know what, I'll let you in on something. Everyone in the public eye, man, \textbf{woman}, or teenage pop-star, is continuously scrutinized on their appearance. They haven't stopped talking about President Obama's looks since the start. "Handsome \textbf{black} man from Chicago" raised no protest, well that's a nice thing to say. How about now though? Is it a problem when the discussion is "He has aged quite a bit since he first took office." Um, yeah. Ha! Duh guys, of course he has. The guy has the most stressful job on the planet doesn't he? But what else do you expect living life under a spotlight?So, seriously is that an issue? No?But saying Hillary is starting to look like Madeline Albright is some crime against all of womankind? Hillary can't take that punch, that's what you're saying? Albright isn't even that much older than Hillary and she was the same \textbf{age} when she was the Secretary of State, but, like any of that even matters. These people are going to say whatever they want. Freedom of speech, remember? Also, some of them are obviously joking. I'm not saying it's funny, but it's obviously not serious. You do have the option to laugh that one off. But instead of showing indifference, or better yet strength, we'll just cry. Point and say sexist because you can. Because \textbf{nobody} in the very same media you're whining about is even bold enough to question if it's a fair accusation.What about when all they wanted to do was bash on Governor Chris Christie about his weight? I couldn't believe it, that shit cracked me up. They just kept saying over and over again, half pretending to be concerned, 'Oh well he's much too \textbf{fat} to be president, you don't want him to having a heart attack in the oval office." They even got some quack doctor to make a public statement like 'My professional diagnosis is he's, extremely \textbf{fat}. Oh yes indeed, superduper \textbf{fat} gone any day now I'm afraid.' Haha! Give me a fuckin break! Yeah, he is a big \textbf{fat} guy! Hahahaha. His mom is Sicilian for Christ sake the \textbf{doctors} need one of those BMI charts adjusted for all that dope ass Italian food. That's 'God's Kitchen' man. He's probably barely over par for Sicilians. Anyway, who, the fuck, cares? He isn't dangerous \textbf{fat}. Come on, he's regular \textbf{old} Santa Clause \textbf{fat}! But that's the whole point. He's fine. It was never even about the weight. They just don't like his politics and they're attacking aspects of his character because it's easier and it works. That's just the way that whole stupid game is played. So please stop this thing you're doing, recognize this distraction kindergarten nonsense news for what it really is, and for the love of God would you please make something that resembles a coherent political argument. Unless I missed something here.So what is it then, your brilliant solution? Is it to outlaw saying anything mean about your opponent's intelligence or appearance?Or are you trying to say female politicians should be given some kind of special protection from insult in all public forums because, I don't know, they're women? Because that kind of sounds to me like one of those, uh... you know that thing… Is it 'double standard'?Seriously, what is the mission?Because to be completely honest, I don't think you organization's top priorities are helping American women. I think you're primarily a left wing group using some emotional appeals to stir up support from women voters. So, after really looking for a point in your stupid little video it seems like it might actually be saying women are too sensitive to handle dissenting voices and shouldn't hold public office. You should go check on that.I disagree about film and advertising too. I'd try to change everyone's minds but I feel like it would probably just be a bigger waste of time and I've already wasted too much time.

That includes unprotected \textbf{sex} with strangers, and always seeking new \textbf{sexual} encounters constantly. Sluts are a problem, not a badge of honor.
