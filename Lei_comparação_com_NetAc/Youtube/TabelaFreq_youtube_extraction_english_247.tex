The keyword is fear, although the vast majority of white folks are not \textbf{racist} they are absolutely terrified of \textbf{black} people... all they have to do is watch the news and read the newspaper and keep their eyes open when they're in public. It's the behavior and culture of \textbf{black} people that makes other races fear us... We left at the \textbf{old} adage of when the \textbf{old} white lady clutch is her purse in the presence of a \textbf{black} man. That's not funny, that's true. \textbf{Black} folks are bullies and have a high propensity for violence and crime and that's why these white folks for us. We have to change our behavior in order to get other races to have a better perspective of us. Because right now when they see us all they see is a criminal and somebody that may harm them. The answer lies within us. It's time for us to face the facts and get ourselves straight and then people will stop fearing us so much. But we have to prove it to them...

Of course you would expect someone who is descendent of slaves in a country that was built off the brutal slave labor of their ancestors after being kidnapped from their homelands in Africa for over 200 years and never had a chance to recover afterwards(100 years of \textbf{Jim c\textbf{row}} laws, kkk lynchings, police brutality, the introduction of drugs such as heroin and crack to inner city \textbf{black} communities, tuskeegee experiments, aids, civil rights which destroyed the economic sovereignty of blacks through integration etc).

So by their own admission being a gangbanger is a part of \textbf{black} culture. Now before I get the typical responses, what do they do at pimp and hoe parties. They wear baggy ass clothes, \textbf{tacky} gold chains, drink 40s in brown paper bags and listen to shitty gangsta rap. What do gangbangers do? They wear baggy ass clothes, \textbf{tacky} gold chains, drink 40s in brown paper bags and listen to shitty gangsta rap. That is what the sjw identity politic playing asshats r claiming is purely \textbf{black} people behavior. And cultural appropriation is bullshit anyways, it's a term made by a bunch of white hating bigots who don't realize that the political forces r using the sjw outrage as a tool to get unamerican censorship laws passed. And if anyone wants to insist that cultural appropriation is real then fine, I demand every \textbf{black} owned pizza place be closed down just like those white chicks in Oregon had to close their taco truck because of the bullshit appropriation nonsense.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@its ya boy cash  First of all your response is nearly unintelligible. Secondly, you did not answer the question. He asked why \textbf{black} people consider the violent gang oriented part of the \textbf{black} community \textbf{black} culture. I cannot speak for the \textbf{black} community but I am going to take a guess that not all \textbf{black} people embrace or even consider thug behavior part of their culture. I'm sure other people like thugs would Identify with this but reasonable people might not. You gave some vague reasons as to WHY the community may have developed these behaviors. And on that note I wholeheartedly agree the \textbf{black} community has not been treated well. Thankfully recently things are much different. I have seen impoverished youth in the \textbf{black} community make the change in their lives and break free of the cycle of crime and violence. I think to make this a reality the first thing is to realize we cannot excuse our behavior, own our faults and have to face them head on. Selling hard drugs lends itself to a dark world of the worst of human behavior. Why on earth would you want to invite the behavior of addicts into you life? The begging, stealing, killing, high risk \textbf{sex} and trading of \textbf{sex}, and more. The only reason is they are being taught by their elders, community, music, and environment that this is the way. Hopefully it will change someday, but it might not considering how ingrained a lot of this is. A boy growing up rarely seeing his father and when he does he is watching him cut up dope on a table and him and mom are bagging it up. These are powerful images and lessons to a child, they help shape and build his core beliefs. A proactive effort is needed to stop this unhealthy lesson that violence and crime are any kind of life choice. Yes things have been unfair. No it is not just a product of oppression and systematic \textbf{racism}. There has been choice involved. Make a a better choice. The better choice might not be the easiest or fastest money but piece by piece better choices lead to a better life.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Racism, Sex & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}10/366 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.732 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Jonathan why do drugs lend you in the dark world but for a \textbf{black} person but a white person can murder people all day and claim I feared for my life. Yes there's no excuse but the discrimination in jobs leave people desperate so they sell drugs and get 20-life while rapist, murders and attempted murders get less years and some dont get felonies but a drug case does, so when they get out they can't get a job anywhere but a killer does just fine so the drug dealers have to do the same thing that lands them in jail and some people take it upon themselves to represent a thug mentally usually rappers and influence the listeners.  It's ok to talk about killing \textbf{black} people but white people talk about killing other white people it's an issue this is only half of the reason but I'm not typing a book.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small U know why more white people who commit murder get less time than \textbf{black} people who get busted selling drugs do? Murder is harder to prove than a drug case, so murderers often get offered plea agreements. Part of plea agreement means admitting what u did and confessing in front of judge. It's like the lynchpin of the whole process. Now, since drugs cases r open and shut, u get caught with drugs on u, u go to jail. The plea agreement there is usually tell me who sold the drugs and u get less time. But in the \textbf{black} community that gets labeled a snitch and u lose all ur street cred right? Can't be having that now can we. Or u can try the always substantiated and always true argument of the cops or someone else must have planted it on me defense. But that gambit comes with a max sentence if u get found guilty. But what it all boils down to in my mind is, there r certain people who refuse to accept reality when they get offered a plea bargain, they refuse it on the belief that the judge or jury will buy whatever bullshit story they tell them, and then they cry conspiracy when they get found guilty. No, that isn't all \textbf{black} people, not even all \textbf{black} people who get arrested, but a realistic number would be about 85 of \textbf{black} people who have been found guilty since the year 2000. But once again Cash, u still think that's it ok to open random crates of drugs and guns in the street and decide to sell them to ur community rather call someone, the cops, the local news, the fire department, someone who can start an investigation into who is leaving the phantom crates.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Because when Italians immigrated here a lot of them held onto the ridiculous notion (the same one \textbf{black} tend to hold onto) that the police and local city governments were not too be trusted. Back in the \textbf{old} days and in the \textbf{old} country, the mob was more trustworthy and seen as  necessary thing. But then they stared getting greedy and the organization turned into what is today, an organization filled with lazy assholes who would rather take the easy way out and get rich by extortion, murder, drugs, etc. than get a real job. And whenever one of these assholes is killed or put away, I see it as a good thing for the world, because animals who break the law deserve jail.

I answered the question by saying y it's considered part of Italian culture, not white culture though since u have to be pure Italian to be a full fledged member, explained when the organization turned into what it is without assigning blame on anyone else but the idiots in the mob, and then I condemned the mob.

The mob is more successful because they don't just target random people and houses on a whim. The mob studies where and when they attack. They run better rackets, they offer better protection, they r better at being criminals. This doesn't excuse their behavior and they all deserve to be ass raped in prison, but they have a less flashy way of going about breaking the law. And of course u see \textbf{racism} every where u go, because u WANT to see \textbf{racism} everywhere u go. People like u need to see \textbf{racism} everywhere so u can continue to go on blaming everything wrong in ur life on the corrupt and evil white man. U refuse to believe that even after all the hand outs and government programs and private charities dedicated to helping \textbf{black} people make something out of themselves that maybe, just maybe, a lot of ur problems come from within ur own communities and not from an external force. Is the government corrupt, fuck yea it is, but it created all the welfare and food stamp programs that a lot of people, all colors, have come to depend on for survival. Is there \textbf{racism} in the the police force, yea, but not nearly as much as people like u would have us believe.
