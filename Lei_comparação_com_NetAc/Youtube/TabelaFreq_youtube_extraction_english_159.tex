  \cellcolor{green!5}\small So very, very true and I am with you on this 100!! Whoever made rules for the beauty community must not be of a certain \textbf{age} group in the mature community, or if they are maybe they came from a generation or never felt the need to wear or do certain things. I always tell people to wear what makes them happy, and what they enjoy. In my book there are no rules at all, I go with it, and smile :) Have a good weekend, you now got me intrigued to do a video also about this very thing.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I am a total believer in spreading the message that we as mature women need more cosmetic company representatives. I too hate when skin care and cosmetics demonstrate products on younger women who have no visible need for it like u see with eye creams, etcThank you for doing this awareness campaign. I will be joining the YouTube community soon to talk and show \textbf{woman} with physical limitations using beauty products. As we \textbf{age} sometimes we develop arthritis and other functional limitations that make us adapt or repurpose tools and products to meet our needs. But make no mistake we are also extremely passionate about beauty products and have been gravely overlooked for yrs\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/115 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.739 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Im sorry but I'm going to have to disagree with you 35 mature skin really?? I don't think so even 40 is NOT mature skin at all! even 50 isn't mature skin things don't really start changing I'm talking about actual wrinkles not lines! Tell about \textbf{age} 56 around there. although I will say for me I'm a natural blond and we do \textbf{age} quicker it's the pigment of our skin so about the \textbf{age} of 49 i guess I had to start totally wearing different eyeshadow colors that I never would have worn when I was younger! and had to start reapplying makeup totally different otherwise I looked like a clown literally!!I'd always been able to wear a lot of \textbf{crazy} colors but dark Browns and \textbf{BLACK} EYELINER was my number one look!!\textbf{black} eyeliner does NOT work for me at all anymore I look like a streetwalker nor do the brown eyeshadows and lipstick colors I could wear any and every color which I can't do anymore especially dark colors that's very aging especially when they're Matt I never really wore Foundation just blush and bronzer I still can't stand the foundation I don't really have \textbf{age} spots I'm 61 but yeah I won't buy a lot of products because it's promoting an anti-aging product especially moisturizers or eye creams they're promoting and have a 13 to 20 year \textbf{old} up there as the model I simply WON'T BUY their product!! Because that SCREAMS to me it is NOT an ANTI-AGING PRODUCT at all !

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Hi Sue, I understand what you're saying about aging not starting until after 50, but I started getting wrinkles at 40 \& noticed changes in my skin at 30, I wish I had started on Retin A at 30.  That just shows us that everyone is different. And you're right we don't have mature skin at 35, but using anti-aging products at that \textbf{age} would really help stave off wrinkles as we get older. thank you so much for watching xx\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/81 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.235 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Wonderful video Melissa !! I will be 50 in a few mths-long story short-I haven't worn any type of makeup since I was pregnant with my 1st of 5 children at 24. Fast forward to March 2018 \& I started dabbling in makeup again. BOY is it so different than it was back then. BUT the only thing that hasn't changed is the ‚Äòyoung perfect looking models' that companies use to sell their product. I understand they do what they have to, to attract the public BUT it's giving younger generations the wrong impression. 'Wear this and you'll look perfect' or 'wear this and you'll have radiant skin(for life)' but it doesn't work that way. These companies definitely need more mature models, say 45 \& up that actually have some wrinkles to show that hey, even though we \textbf{age} we still want to look beautiful as well !! We'll \textbf{age} gracefully !!! Hugs girl xoxox\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/155 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.29 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Very well said Melissa.  I agree with everything you are saying (I also love that commercial).  I've been wearing makeup since I was 17 years \textbf{old}.  I am now 53 and still continue to use it, although now I do use much more products under my makeup (such as primer, moisturizers etc) to make sure my make up still looks good on me. I love to wear false eyelashes and look at all the makeup trends and I also love to buy much of the new products that come out.....so not sure why makeup companies would think that you are no longer significant once you reach a certain \textbf{age}. Plus, as you pointed out, I am at that \textbf{age} where my kids are grown and I can afford to pamper myself more (although I must admit I always have).\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}3/139 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.158 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Spot on Melissa.  What makes the most impact with cosmetic companies? Stop buying! Letters and calls are great and may get you some lip service but money is the bottom line- always. There are so many cosmetic/skin care  companies now that we can be selective. If you see an add with a 20 something \textbf{woman} advertising anti-aging products stop patronizing that company.  Personally, I feel the same about skin care companies that blatantly make claims about a product that are patently false. Companies arrogantly assume that people will not read the ingredients or research the validity.  As mature women, we are smarter than that! And with YouTube there are some great, easily accessed  resources  that enable us to take responsibility for what we put on our faces and bodies. I find it abominable that L'Oreal and Lancome have two new foundation products they have labeled as "broad spectrum SPF" when the only filter is octinoxate. Octinoxate does not filter UVA rays, the rays that go deeper, cause skin damage, destroy collagen and contribute to cancer. Because they are categorized as make up and not as sunscreens they do not have to meet FDA testing. Thanks for expanding this discussion.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Right on!  I will forever use makeup!  We are a strong group of women!  Confident in our appearance.  I am \textbf{old} enough to do what I want and I don't follow the so called rules of \textbf{age} related makeup!  I have a grand daughter who is amazed that her grandmother will wear a blue diamond lip gloss!  üòÇ I told her everyone should wear makeup that they like as long as it is tastefully done!

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small A-1 video thank you! I'm 57 years \textbf{old} and feel you hit the nail on so many heads.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I can picture you recommending things you like to people in the store üòÑI love how you follow your own rules. You have a great point that the companies might think our generation wants to play it 'safe' and not experiment - actually I experiment MORE now because I can't just slap on any ol' concealer, powder, or lipstick like before (liquid lipstick? Not happening. Ever) I used to buy the same things over and over 20 or 30 years ago. I'm also way more picky than I used to be because of experience with makeup in general, like everyone else who's over 25. One thing I will say that bothers me that isn't talked about for sensitivity reasons -  big channels with millions of subscribers (who take in every word they say) are very vocal about discrimination when it comes to shade range, saying companies don't acknowledge all demographics and only cater to certain skin tones, and that's a valid point. They will literally boycott and encourage others to follow suit to send the companies a 'message'. Ok, great, but I never hear any of them complaining that certain \textbf{age} demographics are being excluded. I'm sure the companies are making what sells and don't need to consider \textbf{age} (in their minds) because they are making money regardless. I hope this makes sense.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/223 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.897 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small It completely made sense Wendy.  \textbf{Ageism} is a real thing.  I remember my mom 10 years ago saying that it's awful to get \textbf{old}.  And it made me so sad.  Now I'm aging, I feel that way many times.   One thing I really don't like is the lack of respect that young people have for older ones.  It makes me furious when I see some of them making fun of older people.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Ageism, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}2/72 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.778 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Melissa you took the words right out of my mouth!  These are my EXACT feelings about the beauty community!  The only companies I have seen who use more mature women in their campaigns are Lancombe and Covergirl.  I wonder what all the other brands would think it all of a sudden we stopped supporting them the way they stopped supporting us at a certain \textbf{age}?  I feel sure that we are spending more money on products whether it be for ourselves or for our daughters and granddaughters.  A 15 does not have the money for Two Faced, but Mom may!  I also think the beauty community within platforms like YouTube and Instagram are sending the wrong message to our youth.  I think more and more young people feel like looks are all you need in life, that everyone focuses their time on perfect makeup and then capturing each second of their lives with selfies.  What do I have has become more important than who am I.  It's sad and it's going to affect the future.  Beauty gurus don't have perfect lives.  They work hard, have ups and downs, heartbreak, frustrations.....just like everyone else.  However the younger ones portray perfect lives, perfect homes, perfect makeup, unlimited money all the time.  The younger generation is striving to be like their favorite YouTuber but the problem is that YouTuber is only showing their viewers as much of them as they want us to see.  We are seeing editing and pieced together parts of their lives.The message across the board needs to change.

It's the same with some (definitely not ALL) of the Mature Fashion Community! I'm so glad I've found Melissa and a select few other Mature ladies that are all about breaking through the myths!

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I totally agree with you, Melissa! You should be able to wear whatever you like \@ any \textbf{age}. We are all beautiful in our own way. Just do what makes you happy.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small When I'm 95 I'm still going to be rocking my makeup and that includes shimmers. Purple and pink are my neutrals and that won't ever change. Neither of my daughters, one 23 one 20, even wear makeup and that's the generation Beauty Companies are after. Many of their friends don't wear makeup either! I watched Risa's video and it was so well done but I get so frustrated because we aren't listened to.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small That is so true. Just because women are older doesn't mean that they don't care about makeup. It is the exact opposite because we are getting wrinkles, \textbf{age} spots and things like that so we want to make ourselves look the best we can. I quit wearing makeup for almost 20 years and I started back up this past year because I had some health problems in 2016 that changed how I looked for a while and it made me feel bad about myself. I am healing and starting to look more like I use too but¬†I realized that¬†even without the health problems, I don't look like I did 20 years ago which is a duh because I will be 48 this year and therefore my 20's was long ago. ¬†So, you go girl!!!!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/136 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.735 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Julie Bryant - Good for you for starting to take pride in your appearance again! I had a \textbf{freak} accident in 2009 that left me in a wheelchair or on crutches between the 3 surgeries I've had since then (surgery 4 coming up), so I gained over 50 pounds and with all the steroids I didn't look like ME at all. Then a few years ago I developed a chronic illness and when I had to give up my career, severe depression kicked in. I stopped wearing makeup and stopped caring how I looked. My husband divorced me (was final earlier this year). But I lost 70+ pounds a year ago and that gave me motivation! About 6-8 months ago, I started watching Beauty videos and getting into makeup. I'd used the same drugstore stuff for 35 years (I'm 50), and I'd never heard of any other brands except maybe Clinique. Haha! So, everyone comes to this point in their lives differently and at different ages. Just keep it up this time! I'm never giving up on myself again... I'm single and now is the time I REALLY need to look good. üòÅ HUGS for more healing!!! ü§óü§óü§ó\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Freak & \cellcolor{green!5}Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}1/198 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.505 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Lori Abercrombie Congrats, Fifty is a Tricky \textbf{age}, and when people would ask my \textbf{age}, I snapped a little saying I was \textbf{old} enough to have manners and  know how insanely rude it is to go around asking people you just met their \textbf{age} üëπ(I guessI was uncomfortable with my \textbf{age}) BUT...  when I turned 60,  I realized I was saying my \textbf{age} loudly \& proudly,üë∏ of course to the same ill mannered crowd, yet they were nice enough to say your not 60..I can't believe your even in your fifties, no way, you must be in you early fifties..or mid fifties...I assured them if I was going to fib about my \textbf{age} I would not increase the number 5 to 10 years. But I thanked them... I like the sixties so far. Better then adjusting to my \textbf{age} in my fifties. So embrace your \textbf{age}, look into anti inflammatory diets, love your skin care, and I thank my lucky stars I started skin care early on, and if you haven't, embrace it now, its your most productive quiet time to spend with your self, and use your Sunscreen all seasons, on sunny or cloudy days. (Notice I didn't mention exercise, hmm...That's a thought to add to your bucket list). Oh and if you want a chuckle, do look on the Estee Lauder web site and look at the GIRLS, promoting EL products, if one of them is over 16 years \textbf{old}, I will be shocked.
