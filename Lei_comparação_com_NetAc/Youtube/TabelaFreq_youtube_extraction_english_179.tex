  \cellcolor{green!27}\small For the lady's and gentle men to hear!1 Peter 3 New International Version (NIV)3 Wives, in the same way submit yourselves to your own husbands so that, if any of them do not believe the word, they may be won over without words by the behavior of their wives, 2 when they see the purity and reverence of your lives. 3 Your beauty should not come from outward adornment, such as elaborate hairstyles and the wearing of gold jewelry or fine clothes. 4 Rather, it should be that of your inner self, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God's sight. 5 For this is the way the holy women of the past who put their hope in God used to adorn themselves. They submitted themselves to their own husbands, 6 like Sarah, who obeyed Abraham and called him her lord. You are her daughters if you do what is right and do not give way to fear.7 Husbands, in the same way be considerate as you live with your wives, and treat them with respect as the weaker partner and as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life, so that \textbf{nothing} will hinder your prayers.Suffering for Doing Good8 Finally, all of you, be like-minded, be sympathetic, love one another, be compassionate and humble. 9 Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult. On the contrary, repay evil with blessing, because to this you were called so that you may inherit a blessing. 10 For,'Whoever would love life    and see good daysmust keep their tongue from evil    and their lips from deceitful speech.11 They must turn from evil and do good;    they must seek peace and pursue it.12 For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous    and his ears are attentive to their prayer,but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.'[a]13 Who is going to harm you if you are eager to do good? 14 But even if you should suffer for what is right, you are blessed. 'Do not fear their threats[b]; do not be frightened.'[c] 15 But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect, 16 keeping a clear conscience, so that those who speak maliciously against your good behavior in Christ may be ashamed of their slander. 17 For it is better, if it is God's will, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil. 18 For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God. He was put to death in the body but made alive in the Spirit. 19 After being made alive,[d] he went and made proclamation to the imprisoned spirits— 20 to those who were disobedient long ago when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ark was being built. In it only a few people, eight in all, were saved through water, 21 and this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also—not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a clear conscience toward God.[e] It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ, 22 who has gone into heaven and is at God's right hand—with angels, authorities and powers in submission to him.Luke 7:36-50Jesus Anointed by a Sinful \textbf{Woman}36 When one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him, he went to the Pharisee's house and reclined at the table. 37 A \textbf{woman} in that town who lived a sinful life learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee's house, so she came there with an alabaster jar of perfume. 38 As she stood behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them and poured perfume on them.39 When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, 'If this man were a prophet, he would know who is touching him and what kind of \textbf{woman} she is—that she is a sinner.'40 Jesus answered him, 'Simon, I have something to tell you.''Tell me, teacher,' he said.41 'Two people owed money to a certain moneylender. One owed him five hundred denarii,[c] and the other fifty. 42 Neither of them had the money to pay him back, so he forgave the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?'43 Simon replied, 'I suppose the one who had the bigger debt forgiven.''You have judged correctly,' Jesus said.44 Then he turned toward the \textbf{woman} and said to Simon, 'Do you see this \textbf{woman}?

He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, ‘God, have mercy on me, a sinner.'14 'I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God.

Yet who of his generation protested?For he was cut off from the land of the living;    for the transgression of my people he was punished.[b]9 He was assigned a grave with the wicked,    and with the rich in his death,though he had done no violence,    §3nor was any deceit in his mouth.10 Yet it was the Lord's will to crush him and cause him to suffer,    and though the Lord makes[c] his life an offering for sin,he will see his offspring and prolong his days,    and the will of the Lord will prosper in his hand.11 After he has suffered,    §3he will see the light of life[d] and be satisfied[e];by his knowledge[f] my righteous servant will justify many,    and he will bear their iniquities.12 Therefore I will give him a portion among the great,[g]    and he will divide the spoils with the strong,[h]because he poured out his life unto death,    and was numbered with the transgressors.For he bore the sin of many,  §3  and made intercession for the transgressors.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}1/445 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.225 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Buy the Delta \textbf{Brat} DLC and she becomes a Level 69 Ultra Super Mega Turbo Delta \textbf{Brat} with the ability 'Have Children' allowing her to play summon extra token creatures as copies of herself at Level 1. Oh, but I guess if you're playing Tournament the DLC isn't allowed, so I would recommend a setup of a BratBlade and Pageant Armour with the very rare Timeout Timer, which, if you didn't know, increases the damage depending on the level of Bratness, which, at Level 35 as a Boss Should be capped at 200 with the other equipment I recommended. But if you're playing Legacy, Delta \textbf{Brat} is a must-pick and along the way, you may as well pick up the Ohmygah Mum DLC Pack which allows you to play an Ohmygah Mum at a maximum of level 420, with their main focus being support. Since it's legacy, you may as well pick up a Every Other Person that Exists is Stupid pendant, which can be bought for 500 gold.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Wow, I'm dumbfounded of SOME refractory demeanors of the Westerners. Their children are spoiled brats rooting to nonfeasance of proper parenting. They pervert their rights. I know it's a democratic state but they need to know their limitations too—that's why I supposed "Democracy is another term for war". I loathe these juveniles who already have a brain to understand enough policies. Children here in our homeland are \textbf{nothing} like the Western creatures. Our place is more systematized, God-fearing, and children listen to their parents. It has become a tradition—a part of our culture; to respect elderly; show honesty and humility to everyone. Not only the children, but the parents and the academies should know what is 'Good Manners and Right Conduct'. They should all be shamefaced—the world can see their deeds and it's something to be abashed of.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}1/138 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.725 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I saw this and I feel pissed and mortified for the sake of these kids. I consider this child abuse. Parents making the kids do what they don't want to do, parents yelling, arguing, and cussing in front of the children, and just treating them like \textbf{nothing} other than fashion accessories. As aiden said, this is exactly how not to raise a child 101. These parents are a failure. Kids are young and just want to be kids and they have only one chance to do so in childhood. If you take that away from them in this manner, they will only end up not knowing how to handle situations later in the adult world and fall irreversibly. Children are not make up playthings, and this needs to stop.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}1/129 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.775 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@MagicalMxshroom that's true. Of course very few toddlers act this extremely. But i can guarantee you evey toddler acts egocentric some more than others. You could be toddler that doesn't show this behaviour much and every kid is different. I am studying to become a primary school teacher and i have this kid when he gets on the swing he does not want to get off. Which is an example of egocentric behaviour. I also have kids who don't show this behaviour at all but that means they already know this behaviour is not wanted. because kids go through fases in different time periods.Keep in mind the kids in my class are 4-5 years \textbf{old} and a lot of them do not show this behaviour.And egocentric isn't the \textbf{dame} as egoistic but i'm sure you knew that :)\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Dame, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/140 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.429 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Shame on this parents! What's wrong with this American parents? I'm not including all but mostly they're really the worst parents I've ever seen. That's why most American people suffers from different \textbf{mental} disorders especially when they reach highschool. Here's a tip in disciplining your child 101- Don't be afraid to raise your hand on them. Because you need to establish to your kids that YOU are the parents and that they need to take your authority seriously and that they need to know what's right and wrong. But please do this privately and not in front of everyone.- After disciplining them make sure to talk to them and tell them your sorry and why you need to do it, tell them you love them and explain to them that it's  one of your duties as a parent to correct them if their misbehaving, because you just want them what'sbest for them.- Don't be afraid to say NO! Let them know that not everything they want they can have because the real world won't be forgiving especially with a spoiled attitude. Tell them that if they want something they have to earn it in order to have it. Make a bargain to them like " If you were able to be in at least top 10 in your class I'm going to grant your request " and in this way you were already boosting their competitive skill and also their determination. But if they failed your bargain talk to them immediately and tell them that they did their best and that your proud of them but at the same time they need to work more hard or smart in order to get what they want. NEVER give their wants until they've proven them selves because the whole bargain will just be pointless.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Mental & \cellcolor{green!27}Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}1/305 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.328 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Europe too. And it's not like that around me, at all.And... You are so wrong. Go see a specialized psychiatrist-educator who will explain the basics. We do not react to corrections in the same way.That a parent slaps his child destroys a bond of trust. There are other ways of education.As with an animal. I was traumatized because of heavy slaps while I was not capricious, except for one thing. Now, I do not trust anyone now. I never had an affection for my mother because of that. Worse, my empathy for people has dropped so much during this period (my entire childhood  adolescence.) And never came back "totally". The psychiatrist I was going to see was angry because he had a lot of consultations for family violence that day. Because YES, it remains a kind of abuse, you do not know how your child can react to that, EVEN if for you it is a normal gesture.Finally, this psychiatrist helped a lot of people at the time, children and parents, as well as my nephew when he was little.He was unbearable, and the problem came from his mother, as she raises him. She was sending bad signals, he was actually lost = serious crisis.Today he is 14 years \textbf{old}, and he is a great teenager. He does a lot of things, and he has an exemplary relationship with his mother.They find compromises when things are not right. Me, it caused a shock, a break, something broke at my very first slap. A lot of things happened in my past. So no, \textbf{nobody} reacts on the same way. And now in the country where I live, it is ABUSE. People are increasingly using educators /specialized psy when they do not know what to do. And it works, according to the cases  people I see. (I'm in medicine). And for your part "do not be afraid to say no, if they want something, they win" is blackmail: "If you want that, provided you". The story of the notes I know too well. Have something against a good note .. The worst education possible. Personally that led me to absenteeism in high school. Tired. Tired. With the impression of having aged 40 years.Plus the other problems of a mother who thinks she is the master of the world, working with blackmail, with exacerbated severity.A bit annoying when you see your friends so well with their mothers, proud of never having to do all that.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small My mum uses corporal punishment. And i dont hate her for it. Because there is a difference between abuse and discipline.And what also happens after discipline. Discipline shouldnt be the outline of your relationship with parents, if thats the case then that becomes abuse.What you said also makes sense  in terms of bargains because my younger sister is ten years younger. There is a literal difference in generation gap in terms of behaviors between her and my \textbf{elder} sister and I. My \textbf{elder} sister and i never had bargains ( if we did something wrong we just got hit and learned for good), but my younger sister does (generation gap) and it honestly helps with her behavior and encourages her to know what behavior is good and what is wrong, what is rewarding and what isnt. My sister being the youngest is/was absolutely spoilt, but shes is getting better. And what you said about not giving into their wants, well my mum sometimes do that .She'll be angry for a good reason, but will give into my little sister and make an excuse her for being tired without actually solving the problem , thats were the spoiling comes from.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Elder & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}2/199 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.005 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I absolutely HATE spoiled children. I took care of some rich woman's 5 years \textbf{old} daughter. She was wearing a fancy dress and for some reason, she had makeup on. The little bitch talked to me like I was her slave. Im gonna write exactly what she said:The \textbf{brat}: Your clothes are ugly. I dont like your face. Mine is better!Me: Um first of all, you're not going to to me like that, and Im sorry but those are normal clothes everyone else wears. And what did you just say?! Your face ain't any better! The \textbf{brat}: Starts crying Yes it is! My face is beautiful and yours is ugly!Me: Ok you little spoiled \textbf{brat}, I am not gonna let you talk to me like that. Your mom might treat you like a princess, but I am not her. To me, you are just another child in the world. You are not better than the others. It's not because you wear fancy clothes and makeup that you are the most beautiful person in the whole universe! In fact, that makeup actually makes you look like a clown. Get down from your little cloud and open your eyes! Im not gonna treat you any different than I treat the other children because your parents are rich. If you act like a spoiled \textbf{brat} one more time with me, I will call your mother and tell her you are not polite with your babysitter. And trust me, she won't be happy about it. Am I clear?And then the little \textbf{brat} started crying even more but whatever I didn't care. She needed to learn her place so I taught her. I have no regrets of what I did, call me cruel to children if you want but I had good reasons to talk to her like that. Children should not be treated like royalty, especially little girls. It gets to their head and they think they are better than others and they can do whatever they want. I was treated normally, my parents didn't spoil me with tons of dresses and toys. I was happy with the things I had and I didn't need more than books(I learned to read at a young \textbf{age} since I didn't have friends before I started school), my family, a little bit of toys and friends. Children dont need more than that.

The goal of treatment is to kill as many cancerous cells while reducing damage to normal cells nearby. Advances in technology make this possible.The three main treatments are:Surgery: directly removing the tumorChemotherapy: using chemicals to kill cancer cellsRadiation therapy: using X-rays to kill cancer cellsThe same cancer type in one individual is very different from that cancer in another individual. Within a single type of cancer, such as breast cancer, researchers are discovering subtypes that each requires a different treatment approach.What can you do to manage the side effects of cancer treatment?Supportive care services describe a broad range of therapies designed to combat side effects and maintain well-being. Treating cancer requires focusing on more than the disease alone; it must also address the pain, fatigue, depression and other side effects that come with it.Supportive care services include:Nutrition therapy to help prevent malnutrition and reduce side effectsNaturopathic medicine to use natural remedies to boost energy and reduce side effectsOncology rehabilitation to rebuild strength and overcome some of the physical effects of treatmentMind-body medicine to improve emotional well-being through counseling, stress management techniques and support groupsWhat does the future hold for cancer treatment?\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Fat & \cellcolor{green!5}Physical Identity - Physical Features & \cellcolor{green!5}2/278 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.719 \\  \hline

Sure they're stern blokes but no need to helplessly announce in a hyperbolic sort of way you're gonna do something not many people would seem to care about...For instance, you said you won't comment ever again, but that's literally the majority of kids in the comments section when they get hit with a weak insult.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Mental & \cellcolor{green!27}Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}1/174 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.575 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small These kind of child beauty contests and tv shows about it makes me SICK. every reality program is about being beautiful or having "beautiful" people in them. They are children and their parents makes them to believe, there is \textbf{nothing} else in life that being beautiful and they make them believe that they are more special than everyone else in this planet. That is why there are these little snowflakes who cant stand if someone doesnt agree with them. Half of the teenagers are depressed because they dont fit in to that what they see in tv and everywhere else. And these kids get so much pressure from their parents when they push their kids to go trough these contests and everything what belongs to it. Why children cant be children anymore. And by the way, that mom who took his kid in time out, havent ever done that before. She was just acting to the camera that she is a good mother who has rules. If you use time out in your family when it is needed, You dont say to your child that "im sorry" if that child is going to have time out for a reason. Look these kids??! Face full of make up. What next? Breast implants to five year olds, who goes to these shitty contests. Why their parents dont teach them important stuff with that same passion they teach their kids to flirt with judges who decide who is gonna win.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I have to agree with you. I am a girl and had I ever acted like these children I would not have gotten a time out I wouldn't have been able to sit down. Also when you put your child in time out there are two things you do not do you don't "Say i am sorry but yur going in time out." That is telling the child that she isn't in trouble when she is. What you do say is "Your in time out because you were not doing as you were asked." and then you place them in time out and time doesn't start until they calm down. When they stop crying and trying to get to you that is when time starts if you start it the moment you place them in then they don't have that time to have their tiny meltdown and come down from it. Time always starts when they have calmed down slightly. They can still cry but they have to stay where you put them. They can not however be in melt down mode. So happy I was what was called a terrific two and an even better 3 according to my mom. She said i never threw tanturms. She says the only time i really cried was when I wanted to be picked up but i never got o melt down point. Not because they picked me up they made it clear they would but had to get to them in the right way like if  could walk I had to walk to them. The other thing I want to touch on is WHY ARE THESE GROWN WOMEN ACTING LIKE CHILDREN?!? First off you do not call other kids bad names in front of your child. Secondly on the mother with the goat or lamb or whatever is was, She took all that time  to make her kid look pretty and she wanted her to pick up poop? Um No. I don't care if you do live on farm are you saying that she runs around a farm in her pageant dresses? Probably not. It takes two second to grab a Kleenex and bed over to pick up poop you don't make your 3 year \textbf{old} who you spent probably hours on to pick up poop. I mean you made the decision to bring the sheep you pick it up. I would have been mortified if my mother ever acted like this luckily as far as i know she neveer has.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}1/420 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.238 \\  \hline

And if you don't like that he swears no one is forcing you to watch him. My family doesn't mind if I curse, but I still don't do it because I have a thing against cursing, but like I said, as long as his parents allow it, he can say whatever he wants.As Miley Cyrus says ‘it's my mouth I can so what I want to' I'm sorry, I couldn't help it\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}2/135 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.481 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small And this is why children should be raised as just that. CHILDREN.Also, maybe calm it down a bit with the weight shaming and cursing? You're obviously only 13 or around there, and I wouldn't have been caught DEAD talking like that in front of ANYONE at that \textbf{age}, and even now I don't. Maybe if I'm really angry I might say I'm Pissed, but thats about the worst word that comes out of my mouth at any given time. But that's just how I was raised. Some people might not care. And about the weight shaming, why? I hope you only said that for comedic effect and that you dont actually talk or act this way in real life. Being \textbf{chubby} or even \textbf{fat} may be unappealing to most people, but you don't realise how truly difficult it is to have an eating disorder or to even just be overweight for no reason or because of being unactive for a long time. It's not like people want to be overweight. And a lot of overweight people are extremely self-conscious, and the insults don't help either. Plus, that kid wasn't even \textbf{fat}. If you call that \textbf{fat} I'm afraid of what you call \textbf{skinny}.Welp, this has been another long winded comment no one will ever read or care about if they do. Plus, I'd be willing to bet money most of this dude's viewerbase is under the \textbf{age} of 13, so anyone who does read this probably won't glean anything from it, and might even start an extremely \textbf{dumb} argument I shall be no part of. Unless I REALLY need to say something. And I'm not assuming the \textbf{age} of this guy's viewers because of what I assume to be his \textbf{age}, but because of the content. Kids are all over "Reaction" and "Roasting" channels, (Which I really don't understand. The channels themselves AND why kids love them so.) and the fact that over 70 of youtube accounts are children under 13. That too.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Ey yo, if the parents of this little \textbf{brat} are reading this, you fucking failed at raising your kid. Scum like you shouldn't have kids.

This world is not sunshine and rainbows, and this little bitch needs to learn that not everything goes her way! We should reinstate the law where you can beat your child! It would show them that there are people out there bigger and badder than them! I witnessed my ten year \textbf{old} cousins friend cuss out his principal, and then ask to fight him! Beat your child! America should be free again! But no, America has become a rotting dump that I want to escape from. I guess you could say America is my personal Hell. To be honest, I really hope this little ugly \textbf{brat} dies. \textbf{Nobody} would cry. \textbf{Nobody} would care. America will probably stay like this, won't it?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I hate that this is the new YouTube :(You just keep getting leafy copycat sh*t in your recommended bar, while your favorite youtubers get demonitized, and quit YouTube.I love it.Unfortunately, I had to edit this comment because apparently people are stupid soooo yah.What i mean by leafy copycats is: youtubers that bash on things and spread negative energy. I'd rather have a funny video and an entertaining video that suits me in my recommended bar, not that typical 15 year \textbf{old} that sits and reacts to a video while spontaneously adding negative comments to it.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}1/99 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.01 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Zornitsa The true problem here lies with us. Simple as that. People produce entertainment, we patronize that. Fact : Art is subjectiveAnother Fact : Entertainment is a form of art I think this kid's content and editing is decent for a 12 year \textbf{old}. So that is why I watch him. Same goes to the people that support him. And you deserve the right to not think so because after all, this is subjective. I just think him calling out awareness that how this show affects and manipulated kid's ideologies is in the right path to ' bad content '. If you think he's producing bad content, I'm sure you also think this show is morally bad since it capitalize on kids.There are also ton of research on how child beauty pageants may lead to dangerous obsession with beauty as they grow up be it over inflated ego or low self esteem, even going as far as developing \textbf{mental} illness such as anorexia. One thing you're downright plain wrong is by calling him similar to Leafy. Yes, he is in the commentary genre like leafy. But that doesn't make them similar. Leafy attacks people that don't deserve it, at best cringy. He also attacks kids and at one instance a autistic man. If you would kindly point out how they're similar, fine. Prove it to me other than they're in the same genre.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Mental, Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}2/235 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.851 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Anon Anon like dude i dont understand why people keep making it about the beauty obsessed 6 year \textbf{old}, i think i was pretty clear with that he doesn't copy paste leafy, i said that he just spreads negative energy, exactly like leafy, and the fact that he is 12 years \textbf{old} just makes it worse because that means he is looking up to youtubers in this genre, and that it is becoming a trend. I have no problem with youtubers calling one or two people out, but at least use arguments and not just 'is this the definition of good parents?'For example GradeAUnderA, he is in this 'genre', but his videos are actually entertaining and funny, this is just plain out a teenager thinking he's a good content creator by literally watching a video and talking to a microphone.You said it yourself, entertainment is a form of art. That art needs to be unique to stay alive and I can tell you that the biggest youtubers on this platform use funny and positive energy, PewDiePie, KSI, Smosh. People like that. And btw dont try to sound smart by using long and advanced words, and typing right because it doesn't make you look smart...It just makes it harder for people to understand the stupid point you're actually making. :p\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}2/222 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.901 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small [Australian accent]Oh! What a rare creature we have here. Today we observe an Alpha-\textbf{Thot} Youngling in her natural habitat. As she will eventually grow, she will learn to manipulate many unfortunate males, and even other lesser thots and females. As seen in these clips, she has several older females and males already under her influence. Truly a brutal and unique hunting strategy. Even at a young \textbf{age}, Alpha-Thots can convince many others and gain much popularity. These creatures are certainly a threat to humanity. They begin by purposely leading others into arguments to further their own interests, in a very rare and unique mastermind method. Just a reminder from us here at Shitpost Wilderness, do not approach or converse with these creatures, and if you spot one, notify your local \textbf{Thot} Patrol division.Stay safe, and keep shitposting.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, THOT & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Gender - Female sexuality & \cellcolor{green!5}2/139 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.439 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I get that this is in humour,  but these "Alpha Thots" are little kids. They have shitty attitudes because of their selfish,  attention seeking,  fame seeking and money seeking mothers.  They have the problems they do because they're being forced to do something a child is not mentally ready for,  not to mention what a shallow,  fake world they're growing up in that is giving them a false sense of what self worth is about, outside "beauty", ie: shit tons of makeup, fake \textbf{tan},  big hair and princess tiaras.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Noreen Murchante ahem, Did you not read my post?I specified that i respect your ideals ( semi christian due to family, mainly atheist) and while that is not alot, frankly, your rant just goes to show that you are quite the angry person. OPFORUM.NETjust leaving this here for the lols.ON to the claim that i am " vulgur" .....How \textbf{old} are you? This is one of the few times people have been offended by my "vulgerness".   IN FACT, my mom dosent give a shit if I say minor cuss words ( thank god they arent helicopter or narcisstict parents) like crap.Going back to the heli and N statements, judging just by your attuitude and general offense towards a teenager(which is obvious btw, if you watch my shitty vids) who cusses rarely as mentioned above, is , ironically, something aHELICOPTER SECRETETLLY NON RELIGIOUS BUT PRETENDS TO BE OUT OF SPITE PERSON.DISCLAMER: anything you reply to me will be read, I will not reply to anything similar to the comment you sent to me, only non biased and calm debate\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}1/185 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.541 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Noreen Murchante i believe we should report this kid.

Almost everybody that acts this way towards religion usually isnt a part of that religion (complicated)Now onto my last point, THE TIMES OF YOUR REPLYSI posted my previous comment at around 7:28 central time. You replied not 5 minutes later, and along with this, assuming you can type as fast as I can, (around 70wmp) then that is a short time to ACTUALLY READ MY REPLY.FURTHER PROVING MY POINT is your attidute. I have never met a adult that acts or behaves in this way(excluding parents and close friends for obvious reasons)Specifically in chruch, where its almost always a meme fest before service.I will read anything else you say, and i will not report you, but keep this spam and harassment up and I WILL\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/221 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.452 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small So let me try to understand what's happening here, a viral video of a little toddler is now famous for being a make up wearing glamor girl that wants to show to the world she is beautiful in every way, shape and form, in every day of the weeks, months years as well as day and night times which makes her parents not only happy but also concerned that she gets so moody and fills up with a tantrum unless everyone cant fully see that in her as well...While she overly concerns about being beautiful and a good actress for beauty pageants that deserves recognition and awards like tiaras, dresses some 14 year \textbf{old} sounding reactor to the video concerns she might've had to many pixy sticks, cocaine, they explain they have a sister of their very own but if that they are to ever act like someone concerned that they want the whole world to see them for a beautiful \textbf{woman} then they'll want to move to Mars.............I'm sorry is this stand up comedy? is this the new Dane Cook or something? because I can feel and hear mostly just insults come from this person describing the little girl as if she wasn't acting her own \textbf{age} but more so like someone who deserves to be on camera for laughs when posted to social media and talked about how they can't believe such big things come in smaller people like this reactor is rather the less disciplined child then her herself, because what's with the cocaine comment? does this person honestly believe she might've gotten to snort drugs at her \textbf{age}?  I can see if this little girl and the reactor where with each other, imagine if they lived together amongst 2 parents, this is surely going to be a situation where he plays GTA 5 on an Xbox and however would avoid doing his homework as he finds schools policies and terms stupid and questions why students like him would be put in detention for rude behavior or fights started in school\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Old, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}4/346 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.156 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small y y it is possible it was done by the narrorator of the video but evidence suggests otherwise. First off, the video was edited by software that definitely was not windows movie maker or imovie. Most other editing software that can do this is incredibly complicated, not so much the editing part, but the publishing part. In order to use software like that, you need to know your system on a lower level than a kid would. This suggests adults were involved. Second, the use of curse words was "mature" and not typical for someone his \textbf{age}. Third, the hardware used for recording was high quality. If it was a kid working alone, he would most likely not have access to such a high quality mic, or anything. I certainly didnt when I was his \textbf{age}.Again, its certainly possible he did it himself, but I am quite skeptical\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/149 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.342 \\  \hline

My mom would just pick me up, over her head, and throw me across the room winding me on the floor in pain.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small First of all it is not the fault of these little kids that they behave this way. The parents did a bad job.

These kids would be far more calm, patient and smart. These beauty pageants are one of the worst places for kids, especially in that young \textbf{age}. All they learn is how to judge people by their appearances and to gain the attention which their parents probably never got. It's sad, what is happening in the USA. In pedagogy you learn that kids are a very special part of our society - our future, but if parents only invest in their make-up and clothes, they will evolve into something you can see in this video.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small 00000 0 First of all it is not the fault of these little kids that they behave this way. The parents did a bad job. Kids want to evolve by giving them a healthy surrounding, by educating them and by spending a good amount of time with them outside in the nature. These kids would be far more calm, patient and smart. These beauty pageants are one of the worst places for kids, especially in that young \textbf{age}. All they learn is how to judge people by their appearance and to gain the attention which their parents probably never got. It's sad, what is happening in the USA. In pedagogy you learn that kids are a very special part of our society - our future, but if parents only invest in their make-up and clothes, they will evolve into sth. you can see in this video.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Elle. squish. 8210 (third opinion)As we go through this life we have, we must accept and realize that \textbf{nobody} is perfect in the world, and human nature makes all kinds of mistakes. I believe that when people make mistakes, its really important to never repeat it again and learn from the first time. We make mistakes on tests, we make mistakes on choosing our better half who ends up to be the total opposite of who you had known from before, we make mistakes on our work, in our homes, in choosing friends who are really not that great to be around with and hanging out with the wrong crowds. These can all be corrected when we make the right choices in life and when we are selective and very careful about associating with types of people there are in the world. Making mistakes is part of human nature, but we must also realize to prevent from the same things to happen again.If at first you don't succeed, and when you make a mistake in a test, or in an assignment, the willingness to re-do and try it again is totally up to you, but I would take it. If this happens to you, go up to the teacher, professor and have a civilized conversation with him/her and explain honestly on what happened and see if you can redo an assignment and hand it in. I know sometimes some teachers give an assignment or test and you cannot redo it again, but it never hurts to ask the teacher for a re-test or something and apologize to the teacher and say, I could have done better, I could have excelled more in making the grade and apologize for it. I am certain that when your sincere and you admit that you did not study hard enough and you did many mistakes on a test and when you come clean about it and re-study for it, you mark my words, the teacher will be pleasant and he/she will accept and give you a re-test. Honesty is the best policy and the teacher or professor will appreciate you for it.Mistakes is something that a lot of people do not admit in doing and there is really no shame in doing mistakes because everybody does it. It is hard to admit our mistakes and we try to hide it as much as we can, but it comes out no matter what happens. Do not worry about it so much, but worry about it if its been done more than once or twice. In Order to succeed, go forward and excel in life, we have to make mistakes in order to do better things in the long run and in order to progress well. If we ourselves do not make mistakes, then how will we ever know to do the right thing? I know the solution. Always analyze and think about your actions and words before you say and do them. Do your best to not make the same mistake twice and it does not hurt to ask for guidance and assistance with things. Not asking for help and making mistakes is a mistake in itself. There is no shame in it.I know a lot of us are proud and want to do things on our own without help, without asking, without coming clean about it, but that really is not a great way to deal with it. There are many websites out there with so much information, there are people who can help us, make a phone call, send an e-mail when curiosity strikes, when you want to know how to do something, make something or get something done. There really is no shame in asking. It is a shame if you do not. Helping each other out and doing things together is very important. I know a lot of people are independent and do everything on their own and have never asked for help in anything, but one day we may need that help.So try not to make mistakes, but make mistakes to learn and get ahead. \textbf{Nobody} achieves greatness without it.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nobody & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}2/692 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.289 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small This show is a joke. The children are exploited by their parents who live through children. The first little girl is doomed basically because she has been allowed to be a \textbf{brat} and wasn't taught any different.      The \textbf{woman} who locked her child in the room wasn't even doing anything because the daughter isn't supposed to be screaming but sitting down or standing. It's called time out I think or something similar to that so don't see how shutting the door is going to help when the daughter wasn't even behaving during her time out.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Don't these parents even realize what they're really doing to their own children? They're just a kid! Did they really just failed to understand that those words means that their kid cannot really choose what's better for themself let alone tell their parents what they really want?? See, these children here, they believe in their parents so much that they're litterally let themselves being controlled by their mums and dads. I bet those children had no fucking idea about anything like friends or something like that because their parents keeps on telling them to "get prettier".  As a parent, they should've realized that make ups are NOT FOR KIDS. Sure, it'll be funny to play with it once in a while but NOT THIS OFTEN?? Like, serriously? I might be wrong, but, what if there's unsuitable chemicals in the make ups? What if its slowly destroying their skin? Not only that, putting on make ups on little kids right before telling them that they're pretty is basically telling them that you can only be pretty with make ups. Isn't this is such an unhealthy way of thinking? Being a little kid is fun. You can play all day and do lots of shit with your friends. Innocent times are wonderful. Not this! What the hell is this? All of their childhood are wasted on make ups and dresses??Parents, just because this children is yours, doesn't mean that you can do whatever you want with them. They do have a brain, have feelings. Don't just care about their reputation, achievement, body physic. Care about their feelings too. This is one of the "nowadays first world problems" : Parents viewing their own child as "living tools for great achievement". Yes, we know that you want your children to achieve great things, so you can show the world that you're really proud of them, but, bitch please, are they fine with that? It's no fun living in the world of luxury and fame yet little to no happiness. Your child is not a tool : they're a person.Take a moment to think to yourself. Giving them shelter to live and food to eat shouldn't have really been count as "a parent's kindness" since all of that is a must. Why? Well, you could go to jail if you don't treat you kid well. So just because you're the one who raised them doesn't means that they should obey everything that you said. Yes, I said "everything" because not all of them are that bad. My point is, parents should really try to chill out when it comes to raising kids : their kids are not a \textbf{race} car that you can \textbf{race} to get big prizes.Edit : Yes I wrote all of these down cause I'm triggered af\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/468 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.427 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Dude - this is not a question of the toddlers, YOU HAVE NO CLUE WHAT YOU ARE ACTUALLY CRITIQUING - in this video you are on both sides of this argument. It is like you are bi-polar on your commentary. First you blame the adults, and then you criticize the toddlers reactions. I wouldnt be surprised if you end up being just like the goat guy. For instance you insinuate an adult would give a toddler some cocaine - that is not funny - it is illegal, Watch what you think is humor, especially about young kids. It seems a bit hypocritical seeing you pulled the innocent kid victim card to get your platform. Now you are criticizing toddlers - and telling them to take cocaine. That isn't shock comedy. That is re-portable narrative, Youtube has been really harsh on this recently. Your tone and dialog come off as harsh and bullying. Ayden, I think you have a great career a head of you. But you are destroying your chances with this type of content. Chances that could elevate your platform to a whole new level.In this video you are beyond salty - you are borderline toxic. As an influencer you are more like the toddlers in this film then the adults. If you want to make some good commentary stop criticizing people for what you know \textbf{nothing} about. Stick to youtubers - leave the rest of the world alone. Until you have experienced it.Keep making content - just tone down what you are criticizing. Watch your dialog and your subject matter. It takes time to figure out how to be edgy and relevant without being a belligerent bully.As to toddlers and tiaras - that show is disgusting - the worst form of humans exist in child pageantry. there is no need to call them scum. It is a well known fact. TLC is known for some real crap. and T\&T is some of the worst. I say pick a reality show that is borderline watchable and dig the crap out of it. Like the walking dead - or a million other crime dramas - critique the writers and their lack of plot story and detail, and destroy the lazy incompetent worms we have to put up with. or make them sharpen the tools of their already overpaid writing and editing careers. This will get you noticed and possibly involved. You have some great wit and good timing. The humor needs to mature a bit. That will come with expierience. Good luck. I hope to see more.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!27}1/430 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.233 \\  \hline
