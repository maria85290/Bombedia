Now she found a new way to get attention being this twatt she is today. If you disagreed with the adam sandler audition don't go move on the world doesn't evolve around you, that's a hard concept as your an out of work washed up actress screaming for attention in the last resort you could. i think maybe you where just angry because you didnt get the part spiteful twatt so you need to chuck a tantrum.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}1/144 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.694 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The legal system in most countries truly needs an overhaul due to the way victims of \textbf{sexual} assault and/or rape are typically treated.In many western countries a single judge, typically a male, is the person who decides whether the case "has merit" enough to go to trial which involves a jury. And unfortunately those few cases where a \textbf{woman} does report the rape to police and takes it to court usually end with that one judge deciding it won't go any further i.e. the case is dropped. Furthermore, those women who do go to both the police and the courts commonly experience a lot of blaming by police officers and it gets much worse when it comes to the lawyer defending the assailant(s).   It still happens that the \textbf{sexual} history of the victim is legally allowed to be brought up, as is her mode of dressing, behaviour and so on, all to try to make it look like it wasn't assault or rape. And if the \textbf{woman} froze, a most typical response to \textbf{sexual} assault and understood as quite a normal reaction -  at least by psychologists and rape crisis counsellors - the fact she froze and didn't physically 'fight back' is taken to indicate she consented! Unless a survivor of assault or rape has very obvious marks on her that \textbf{doctors} - typically those who saw her after the traumatic event such as when making up the 'rape kit' in Hospital EDs - will unequivocally state is proof of force used against her, from bruising to tears etcetera, it's extremely \textbf{common} for the case to be reduced to one of 'he said, she said' with the survivor being further victimized by a court system where a \textbf{woman} who has been assaulted or raped has every aspect of her life out under the microscope by the defendant's lawyer to try to prove it was consensual and indeed to blame the survivor. Furthermore even cases where evidence of physical force is obvious, the assailant's lawyer will still try to make it appear to be a case of consensual \textbf{sex} that was a bit 'rough'. One famous case in point is in the book "Lucky", the debut novel of the writer, Alice Sebold, of the much more well know "The Lovely Bones" (which was made into a movie), in which she relates her own horrific rape and the trauma of getting it to court - and winning. At the time, Alice Sebold was a virgin who was attacked and raped by a man she did not know on her College campus, and it was very obvious that it was an incredibly aggressive rape: her assailant had also threatened her with a knife, nearly strangled her, hit her etc. - but the lawyer for the rapist went on the attack in court regarding everything from the clothes she was wearing at the time to asking why she didn't strike him or scream out! The book, "Lucky", is a must-read for every \textbf{woman} (and those who know a \textbf{woman} who has been through \textbf{sexual} abuse, assault and/or rape), particularly as it reveals the mendacious techniques used by lawyers for rapists and abusers, and the way victims of such trauma are re-traumatised by the legal process.Combine the horrendously traumatic effects of being through \textbf{sexual} assault or rape - such as seen in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), a frequent result of such events - with the current legal system that tends to revictimize the survivor(s), and it's no wonder so few women report assaults.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Common, Sex, Sexual, Woman, doctors & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General, Nationality - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}13/590 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.203 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Rose McGowan was never a Meryl Streep or Julia Roberts type actress.  She used \textbf{sex} to get where she is and now wants what others worked for. She didn't quit Hollywood it quit her. She's found relevance in this  metoo era of professional victimhood and manufactured outrage.  I don't think she's ever proven one single ridiculous story she's told. She got crap for bad plastic surgery and made up a car accident. I dont doubt that she slept with producers and regrets it now that the money is gone. She's a pathological liar and narcissist.  She had no problem with \textbf{sexism} in Hollywood back when she was getting roles. This generation certainly needs some strong female role models but people like Rose McGowan and Stormy Daniels aren't them. Plenty of women in Hollywood have refused to do the hotel auditions and lost roles but built careers off talent and hard work. They get absolutely no credit for that. People who build a career on a mattress have a short career.  It only last as long as their looks do.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Sex, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/180 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.111 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Asia Argento was cheating on Anthony Bourdain with Hugo Clement days before his death, it was photographed and all over European newspapers.  Anthony confronted her, they had a fight and Asia post a bullying picture on Instagram towards Anthony, hours later Anthony was dead.  When Asia found out he was dead she removed her bullying post and proceeds to post how he was her rock and how much she loved him.  The media won't call her out because she is huge in the metoo movement and a huge feminist, she was photographed happy with Harvey Weinstein 4 years after the alleged rape occured.  Her friend Rose Mcgowen  was asked to help Asia not get shamed by the public, even though the media has left her alone.  Rose wrote a letter recently and gave it to media outlets to state that Anthony and Asia had an open relationship, (this was not known to be true to anyone, no photos in 2 years with other partners, Asia also asked the paparazzi Rino Barillari to delete a pic of her and Hugo dancing ) they are trying to do public relation damage control about Asia being a slut and helping to kill Anthony with her bullying, with not one word of sympathy to the daughter of Anthony or the family.  Anthony deleted Asia from social media before he died....Pass this on he deserves it.  [LINK]  [LINK] Asia Argento once made a movie where they dressed a 10 year \textbf{old} in drag and performed oral \textbf{sex} on Marilyn Mansion.  Her dad made horror films simulating snuff films and had her star in them as a child, he also featured pedophilia.  Asia Argenta's Instagram has many pictures of her worshiping the occult.  It is said that she thinks she is a \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} \textbf{witch} (whatever the fuck that is) Her young daughter has the same images on her profile as well.  Her best friend Rose Mcgowen that helps her try to champion the Metoo movement has a felony cocaine charge pending.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I would've appreciated her opinions and her overall role in the movement a lot more if she had a history of fighting for women's rights and if her career choices somewhat reflected that. But if you look at her work prior to her turning 30 it essentially consists of exploiting her \textbf{sex} appeal, being a gothic-50s \textbf{sex} vixen with an edge and controversy generating \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} carpet dresses.

This person was going to be prosecuted if the victims were willing to be dragged through the mud for months during a public trial. Months of having to endure "slut shamers" like you who was not there but yet somehow knows exactly what happened. The humiliation and shame they already felt was compounded by a room full of lawyers (including their own lawyers and local police) telling them they don't have enough evidence to win a conviction so wouldn't she just rather get it over with by settling? A confident person with enough evidence and a smart lawyer would never back down for some cash. But a scared girl with no support, usually girls with a history of instability or abuse, brainwashed to have a fear of being banished to slut-ville has-beens who failed to sleep their way to the top town, well that humiliated and defeated victem will take what everyone tells her she deserves!

Don't act like you have never heard of rich people getting away with something criminal. There are thousands of cases where criminals and predators have paid away the consequence of a crime. In the case of Harvey, Cosby, and any other cerial rapists, how many victims need to come forward before we start talking about the institutions that enable these Predators versus focusing on how a damaged and scared victem acted poorly.

I disagree also on one thing: women of course must wear what they want and have the right to feel comfortable with their own body, however showing your boobs and ass on a magazine or during an event doesn't give an independent, powerful strong message to women. On the contrary, in my opinion, it gives the idea that that is the only thing women can do. You are sexualising yourself and you are using the same narrative provided by generations of sexist men. To the young girls and women who read this: how to break the narrative? Become writer, director, producer. Create your own narrative and live it. Be aware of the dangers. Learn how to respond.

It is scary when a \textbf{woman} steps into her power, hence the reason men and society wants to keep her squashed down, devalued, demoralised, distressed, depressed, denied.  Also, she isn't being bitter.  Again, Rose, any \textbf{woman} (and man) can speak anyhow they want, if you don't like it move off the video - don't comment.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}4/136 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.941 \\  \hline

It fuels her anger, and seems to be her motivation to say "fuck you" in whatever way she sees fit to say it.On a side note, society controls everyone's sexuality to one degree or  another. It's seen as liberating for people to be free to just do whatever they want, especially with regards to \textbf{sex}, but again, once you get it into your head and accept that you CAN do whatever you want, the next question should be "should I?"

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Roman Darius 😲 I can't believe you just said that. I mean, I sort of get your point of women not protesting for the things that don't benefit them. The thing is in a more biological standpoint, men are usually stronger and therefore better for the army, although nowadays there is a a lot of women in the army. You should also consider that when men were drafted women filled in their jobs, so they were still contributing. The problem is women nowadays, as Rose says (maybe not in the most calm way) deserve equal opportunities in the workplace and not to be a treated as mere objects partly because I think we have proved more than enough that we are much more than that.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Lol.  You know what I find very telling after watching and skimming through the comments?  The majority of male commentors here (and some female) who are proving Rose's point about sexist Hollywood indoctrination.  People don't even have to agree with all her points or perspectives but there should be a way to counter it without resorting to misogynistic remarks.  Most of these insults flying at Rose don't have an intellectual foundation in their bodies.  What I keep reading in response are these defensive attacks saturated with \textbf{sexism}.  The attacks are completely sexualized:   She is referred to as a Cunt (a derogatory term for a \textbf{woman}'s genital area); being told she is just bitter because she is now too \textbf{old} to be objectified sexually; ridiculous justifications that it is nature for Hollywood to sexualize women because of procreation (wtf?); and my personal favorites - all the spiteful MRA anti-\textbf{woman} lingo being thrown loosely around whenever a \textbf{woman} points out an injustice against other women.  We'll hear  'but what about all the men' to detract and counter the female issues.   Or we get 'she is \textbf{nothing} but a femnazi' while all feminism gets brandished as evil and wrong.  All these responses are reinforcing how right Rose really is about the 'system' itself and how the male mind has been indoctrinated to insult or engage in bringing a \textbf{woman} down they don't agree with.   This mindset is also plaguing women too.   Many males here are doing it through \textbf{sexual} name shaming rather than creating some type of respectable argument to debate her points.  The insults go straight to her looks or her feminine sexuality.  She is called \textbf{fat} or ugly; labeled as a Cunt or a Bitch (a comparison to a female dog).  Why?  I mean, at least most of the time when men are being insulted they get more neutral insults flung against them.  Why can't a \textbf{woman} just be a plain out a**hole or a jerk like some guy if all the maturity needs to sink below sub \textbf{zero}?  Why does every derogatory insult need to attack either a \textbf{woman}'s \textbf{gender} or sexuality when there is disagreement?   The very comments proclaiming to be against her are helping to showcase what it is she is actually against.  This is ridiculous.  She gets slammed for actually using the very system in place, that many women have, a system that would have held her back for not complying with it.  And because she might have had some self-realization for what it was that she was participating in she gets crucified for wearing something tight or very revealing at a time in her life to discredit her?  Those types of remarks are showing the misogynistic indoctrination of the West because switch over to some indigenous populations where the females still remain completely explosed on top and use scarce undergarments in their cultures away from civilized indoctrinations.  They are not being sexually exploited or shamed for this by the men in their tribes so this BS argument that it's natural for men to treat or exploit women in this \textbf{sexual} way due to procreation is hogwash.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Fat, Gender, Nothing, Old, Sexism, Sexual, Woman, Zero & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s, Age - Youngsters, Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical Features & \cellcolor{green!27}11/520 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.115 \\  \hline

Strong women and men guide their own career. Rose McGowan took her own clothes off and took \textbf{bimbo} parts.

As if every major hollywood actor isn't some massive heartthrob who has to train 7 days a week for months drinking only chicken milkshakes so you can finger fuck yourselves to them. Men are used as \textbf{sex} objects just as much as women are, the only difference is in the preferences of male sexuality vs female sexuality. Leading men are usually \textbf{sex} symbols for longer simply because women young and older by large margin find handsome older men sexy, and young girls and yes older women, find young twenty something studs sexy as well. Men on the other hand, typically only find younger women sexy, that's genetic, it's how nature wants us to be to find healthy young women to reproduce with and create stronger children, it has \textbf{nothing} to do with \textbf{sexism}. Is Ryan Gosling \textbf{fat} in any movies? Do you think if he suddenly gained 30 pounds and refused to lose it he would get ANY roles, or women would give a fuck about him anymore?Rose McGowan is a fucking terrible actress, she should thank her lucky stars, much like Zac Efron that they were considered so good looking that they got roles even with their minimal talent range. Not to mention that almost every major movie today and video game is dominated by a strong female lead and that's fine but the idea that women are being oppressed.....what kind of brain do you have?This fake men vs women war really needs to stop. Most of us men have supported strong women forever, we don't give a shit if the hero is male or female as long as they are awesome. We all played the shit out of tomb raider 20 years ago and feminists complain that it's only acceptable because she's hot......when the fuck has a male video game hero not been a ripped, ass kicking super dude that none of us could hope to be?This bias blindness women have is really troubling.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small +horrored "3rd wave feminism is about superiority" --- according to you and the other antifeminists who insist on shutting down the discussion by slandering all feminists as being radical anti-man feminists rather than putting forth the effort to counter their claims. To more reasoned people like myself, modern western feminism has multiple facets and focuses and even ideologies (e.g. some feminists insist transwomen are not women), but one sort of consistent theme is a focus on the way society interacts with and constrains women in non-legal manners (with the exception of issues like birth control), as opposed to the more concretely legal agenda of the earlier waves of feminism. So it's a pretty third wave feminist thing to point out the \textbf{misogyny} of rappers, or the type of \textbf{sexism} Rose McGowan is claiming exists in Hollywood. Now, you don't have to agree with her, but the fruitful way of expressing that disagreement is to provide cogent arguments ... not lazily claiming she has no points or logic and that all of third wave feminism is about female superiority.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Misogyny, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/178 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.124 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Roman Darius If you want to talk about tampons, the concept is very simple: if I have a headache, I take medicine. Medication is considered a necessity, so they are not taxed. Trust me, you want me to take medicine for my headache so I won't annoy you with my white girl whining, am I right? So...I'm bleeding from my uterus, I need a tampon. Tampons and feminine hygiene products are NOT considered a necessity, so they are taxed in some states. You want me to use a tampon to keep me from bleeding all over your house, right? I mean, I could free bleed (theoretically, because personally I don't get my period anymore. Cancer sucks.)...now, because of my white girl privilege, paying a tax for my tampons was never a problem for me. It's the principle. Women bleed, we have no choice. We need sanitary products for health, safety, and apparently to make you men feel more comfortable. There are women in shelters, in poverty, and on the streets who free bleed because they have no choice. It's not safe. It's not healthy. Why should lip balm be tax exempt and not tampons? I guarantee if men bled, there would be no tax. Just think about it. Calm yourself and think. In the words of Ashley Judd, since you mentioned her, "I'm nasty like the bloodstains on my bedsheets. We do not actually choose if and when we have our periods. We do not like throwing away our favorite pairs of underpants. Why are pads and tampons still taxed when Viagra and Rogaine are not? Is your erection really more than protecting the parts of my womanhood? Is the bloodstain on my jeans more embarrassing than the thinning of your hair?' Fun fact: Ashley didn't write this poem. It was written by a 19-year \textbf{old} young \textbf{woman} from Tennessee.Fighting for tax exemptions is just of the issues in which we, the privileged white girls, used our voices to bring to the forefront with the Women's March. We used our privileged voices to get people to pay attention. We used our privileged voices to stand up for the underprivileged...and I have a feeling that you are asking, "What are they marching for, anyway? Women already have rights." To that, I say this: This march is for people of all genders, races, ethnicities, socioeconomic backgrounds...people who are afraid to report a rape because others might not believe them. This is for my fellow plus sized women who will be denied jobs because the fitter women "look smarter". This is for the people who do all the work while the opposite \textbf{gender} boss takes the credit. (Yes, Hidden Figures is real, and still relevant.) This is for LBGTQ citizens who just want to love who they love and make it legal, just like you. This is for the young kids who don't have access to quality education and health care. This is for women who wear hijabs and endure the stares and secret suspicions of others. This is for the \textbf{transgender} and \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} teens who are beaten to death and hung to a fence because their attackers are afraid of what is different. This is for the \textbf{woman} who will lose her health insurance and will be diagnosed with cancer, who will have to choose between being treated and going bankrupt or dying. This is for people who have been sexually assaulted by a person in a powerful position (i.e., "grab them by the pussy/balls") This is for my young students who are terrified their parents will be sent back to Mexico, and because of the president's ignorance, they have learned to hate. This is for women who might lose access to free birth control while insurance companies continue to cover drugs like Viagra/Cialis. This is for victims of \textbf{sex} trafficking. This for the people of color who are unfairly treated by some members of the police force, and women of color who do not get equal pay to their white counterparts. *It important to note that these marches happened all over the world, perhaps among women who do not have any rights at all. *During his campaign, Mr. Trump clearly sent a message that he does not respect people who are different than what he sees in the mirror. He has verbally and nonverbally communicated negatively regarding women, hispanics, people of different religious faiths, immigrants, people with disabilities, and other marginalized groups. For example, he says women who have abortions "need to be punished". He says "Mexicans" are rapists, murderers, and drug dealers. Perhaps that's NOT what he MEANT, but that's what people HEARD. Some of my students are children of immigrants who hear these things and think their families will be broken up. They are scared. They listen to what their parents are talking about, and now have learned to hate. I now have to try and undo that. Now granted, he seems to have softened a bit on his stances since being elected, but people are scared. People are resentful. People are angry. They want to be acknowledged. Although he may not have meant harm by his statements, his rhetoric scares people who have fought for and earned equality rights...and anyone who has earned anything knows it can all be taken away by the stroke of a pen (remember The Tudors?), which could make a person angry and untrusting over time. As a white male, he was granted these rights just by being himself. For any other group, it has been a struggle. 500 years ago, daughters were sold to men to strengthen wealth and status for their fathers. Historically, our thoughts and opinions, and our desires were never valued as much as a man's, and it comes down to thoughts like, "well, women already are equal, so what's the problem?", which tells me that the \textbf{patriarchy} is still alive and kicking, which is frustrating. Just because you may not have experienced it doesn't mean it doesn't exist. I'm not saying that everyone at the march was doing it for the right reasons. Hate speech and insulting the president will never get us to where we want to be, but that's what happens when members of these groups feel threatened, and Mr. Trump's lack of empathy and unapologetic attitude is alarming. We can disagree on issues, which is completely fine, but bickering over the details just to get the last word in comment thread doesn't get to the real issue, which is: "I see you. I recognize your struggle. I am with you. I support you. I value you. I will protect you." That's all anyone really wants...and claps for you if you're still reading this. Men, by the way, are more than welcome to organize a march and fight for your rights. \textbf{Nothing} is stopping you.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gay, Gender, Nothing, Old, Patriarchy, Sex, Transgender, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s, Age - Youngsters, Gender - General, Sexual Identity - General, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality, Sexual Identity - Transexuality & \cellcolor{green!27}10/1140 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.877 \\  \hline

They feel inadequate and competitive  around other men that have. Submissive Women make them feel better about themselves and their masculinity. When women aren't it makes them very angry. Because they feel more inadequate. Man struggle with women that make more than them, that are more educated or more intelligent than them. They struggle with women in power situation or women with more skill. Because of \textbf{gender} roles and toxic masculinity. Man is supposed to be the bread winner. The protector. The handy man. They're supposed to be Alpha, a mans man. Captain of the football team not the captain of the debate team. They struggle with this perceived role and their place in the tribe. They want the cheerleader the hottest most popular girl in school because it will solidify their standing in the tribe. More conquests they get the more manly they are.

Just like Dolezal identifies as \textbf{black}, I guess...She said the positive side of \textbf{sexism} that isn't focused on is progressiveness?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@\textbf{M\textbf{ick}} Obrien I repeat, it's grim to see that people like you exist. Value isn't only found in things that are outwardly beautiful. There's value to be found in intelligence and humour, as well as  patience and empathy and thoughtfulness, which are qualities so lacking in many of today's celebrities. A corollary of Hollywood's narrow appreciation of beauty is that they overrepresent young actors, to the point that 30 has become a cut-off point at which an actor is termed "\textbf{old}". Yes, our hair gets grey, but it doesn't mean we become worthless or ugly. Look at how beautiful Audrey Hepburn remained through her 50s and 60s. It was at that point in her career that she turned her attention to humanitarian causes, and showed more of her inward beauty in doing so. You're right that Hollywood places immense focus on physical beauty, but you are wrong to passively accept that "that's just the way things are". It doesn't have to be that way. We shouldn't be passive endorsers of that mentality. It's stifling to art and to creative progress. Beauty is boring. It doesn't represent reality; life is often ugly, and beauty has to (and can) be found in things which at first glance may appear ugly. But Hollywood ignores that fact, and so we get patronising, vacuous movies like Entourage or Fast and Furious 7 shoved down our throats, and WE are the fools for mindlessly buying into it and funding Hollywood's shallowness. To go back to Rose McGowan, I agree that in recent interviews she has come across as very bitter. There possibly have been personal events in her life which have made her this way, and it is not our business to pry into them or mistreat her in the way that some people have. She is not a bitch or a "\textbf{feminazi}", whatever the fuck that means. She's a human being with flaws like everyone else, but at least she's honest about them. She doesn't put on a false grin, or dress up to impress the audience, or act like everything's fine to please her publicist. I admire that hugely. She sees major issues in Hollywood, just as her counterparts like Bret Easton Ellis and Quentin Tarantino have pointed out (and similarly been lambasted), and she does the right thing by speaking out about it. And your idea of beauty is so dull. If you see interviews with Rose in the 90s, she's just wearing a non-descript \textbf{black} shirt and \textbf{black} jeans and yet she's so beautiful because she's intelligent and knowledgable and \textbf{weird} and funny and can sustain an interesting conversation. Those are human attributes which are MORE valuable than how a person looks because they will not fade, and they will only grow stronger as a person gets older.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Feminazi, Mick, Old, Weird & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - Black, Gender - Female intelligence, Nationality - Irish, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments, Religious Identity - Roman Catholic & \cellcolor{green!5}7/466 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.502 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@ohwellwhateverr Basically you agreed with the bulk of what I said. But you can't seem to understand IT IS NATURE. It is nature that makes guys attracted to YOUNG AND PRETTY girls. No kidding there's still value in older women. That's just stupid to point that out. \textbf{Nobody} says after a \textbf{woman} is past her physical prime she's useless. But nature makes some things SEXUALLY attractive and some things not sexually attractive. All I am saying is 'Hollywood', or any industry, will capitalize on that fact for potential profit. You try to sell clothing with \textbf{fat} or ugly people modeling them. You're a liar if you pretend it makes no difference. That's just being \textbf{blind} to reality because you dislike the cruel nature of reality. I understand you don't like that nature is not fair. Some women will get to enjoy being beautiful and desirable. And the same goes for some men. Some men, too, will enjoy being handsome and they'll enjoy having that degree of power. You can't deny physical beauty exists. All I am saying is 'Rose' capitalized on her physical beauty. She milked it when she had it. She's older now. Is that in debate? Do you debate she's not quite as pretty as she was when she was, say, 20? You see, you will debate that. Because you'll combine beauty of all forms into the equation. And I'm only talking about physical beauty, the kind we colloquially call being HOT, or sexually attractive. You know damn well what I'm talking about. Obviously older women are still 'beautiful', but clearly in other ways. C'mon. Let's not play semantics with words. And I don't like this reality of life any more than you. But I won't blame 'Hollywood' for it, or any business. Basically what does 'Rose' expect? Does she expect to play the hot and cute babe roles forever? Because she played those when she was young. And now she's older. What's the problem? Why can't she move on to play more motherly roles? We both know you're all just angry that reality does have something called physical beauty. And not all men and not all women get it. It's just luck. And, it's a curse, too. Because physical beauty will fade with the certainty of what goes up must come down.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small +Karlene E You are drawing very broad conclusions from the point I made. Also, hysteria was a 19century phenomenon. You know, the 1800s was not that far ago!What I wanted to say, is that taking a woman's words at face value is not enough. So going back to the interview: McGowan says many things but it just doesn't sound right. Meaning that deep down she seems to still hold on to Hollywood "values" but for some reason she criticizes them vehemently. So vehemently, that it's suspicious. And this violent split between the explicit message and the stuff actually at play is what hysteria is about. My guess, is that she feels guilty because of all the enjoyment that these Hollywood years brought her. Another scenario, is that she can't stand that because of her \textbf{age} or whatever her HW career is virtually over.Having said that, criticism of HW is something very positive; besides Bret Easton Ellis, the guys from South Park and Marilyn Manson I can't really think of other rebel HW insiders.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/175 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.571 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Maciej P I noticed two levels in her speech as well, but my perception of her is different. I think that she is genuinely angry at the system and she seemed unsure how much of that hate to show... The concept of hysteria can be traced to as far back as the 13th Century. The point with "hysteria" is that it pertains to a time when women were completely undervalued. As such, such a reference to a modern \textbf{woman} is extremely offensive. It is no better than saying: you women and your protestations... You are so silly!!! I can't possibly take you seriously, because you are not my equal." Of course you wouldn't trust the word of someone who is not your equal, no one would.

I think that there are no universal criteria which allow to compare men and women across the board.When it comes to hysteria I think that it still exists nowadays but in a much less widespread way. As a society we basically lost interest in hysteria, because with the rise of new sciences like psychology, sociology and psychiatry people came up with other \textbf{mental} conditions. Society itself changed too, so we no longer obsess over "\textbf{crazy} women" but instead take extreme interest in conditions like adhd, bipolar disorder, depression, social anxiety etc.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Crazy, Mental & \cellcolor{green!27}Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}2/120 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.667 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Maciej P Do you understand what "hysteria" pertains to? The word comes from the Greek word for "uterus". To make this as simple as possible. Back in the day (circa a few hundred years ago), women were thought to have no \textbf{sexual} feelings at all and that the ejaculate from a man was all they would need to placate them. So, there were completely unsatisfied women everywhere (hint: women get "blue balls" too, but our "balls" are ovaries}. So these women were irritable, had trouble sleeping, complained of lustful thoughts and discomfort in the lower stomach. Hysteria pertains specifically to women en mass being sexually frustrated as hell. So no, I do not call that "\textbf{crazy} women" at all. I think that many aspects of our modern world are very \textbf{crazy}, and I am not surprised by a \textbf{spike} in \textbf{mental} health issues as a result, with both men and women. Societal stress is too high, and many people cannot take it. I really think that people were built for a different kind of life than the one that we have.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Crazy, Mental, Sexual, Spike & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments, Religious Identity - Protestant & \cellcolor{green!5}5/181 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.762 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small +Maciej P I think actually the point that needs to be made here is that any scientist in the area of psychology today would be able to tell you hysteria does not exist. It is a very \textbf{old} concept that is no longer valid because it has not been found in the literature. So your comments relating to hysteria and feminism are not related to any kind of scientific reasoning and therefore you should go out and do some research and come back when you have something real to say that is backed up by evidence.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}1/96 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.042 \\  \hline

Since the only people to use such a word have been dead since before our great-grandparents were born, we have to use the word in the way they would have used it, vis-a-vis, hysteria, will for all time be associated with the fact that men thought women were receptacles for their sperm and had no \textbf{sexual} desire that wasn't sorted by a man's ejaculate, thereby making millions of women completely sexually frustrated and generating the very irrational behaviour that men like to ascribe to women.

In my mind, hitting is the ultimate act of disrespect between adults and also a sign that you have utterly given up on communication or that you are incapable of communicating adequately, and maturely.I get what you are saying, but most men are proportionally stronger than women of similar height and build. So, when a \textbf{woman} slaps a man (it's wrong, and I wouldn't do it), it is a strong man (emotionally and mentally) that walks away and doesn't retaliate physically.The only reason I ever raised a hand to my ex was because I was very young and didn't really know better at the time, and also to defend myself.

I can tell you without watching the video, about what happened to me as a result of the abuse. At first, I did not fight back. I blamed myself, I felt as though I had done something so egregiously wrong that he felt the need to punish me. I already had a fairly broken spirit by the time the physical abuse started because the verbal abuse had already smashed my self confidence. So when the hitting started happening, I felt like I was at fault. I don't wish it on anybody. Then one day, I just snapped. He slapped me hard in the side of my head and then, when my ear stopped ringing, I got up off the floor and punched him in the face. Then I started to regain my spirit, and he stopped hitting me and saying stupid shit to me, when I started fighting back. Again, this is only my experience, and again, I wish it on \textbf{nobody}. This is why I chimed in with my 2 cents, when you referenced a man hitting a \textbf{woman}.

There's a lot of judgment from men who call the women who did submit to Weinstein and others "whores", as if that's all there is to it and the pervasive culture of \textbf{sexual} privilege isn't a problem in many industries, where to get anywhere women have to put up with crude remarks at the least, groping and accosting, and requests for \textbf{sexual} favours at the worst. It's a culture where if many women want to get anywhere, especially in the past, they HAD to submit, or risk their careers and possibly even livelihoods.I tried asking another man what he would do in the same situation and he just ignored my question and insisted all those women where prostitutes and whores etc. I guess the only ones who were sexually involved with these men who get off innocent in their eyes are full-on rape victims, because you know, women obviously have 100 choice unless they're physically forced into \textbf{sex}. Or they have to be saintly and hold themselves to standards most men are never asked to in such situations. It's a very bizarre worldview and unfortunately shows us that male privilege is alive and well. Btw I'm a man, and most men do not feel the way comment sections show.

As if I didn't go out of my way to distinguish myself from the sort of sap who blathers on about "shaming" as an excuse for bad behavior. It's not that there isn't a valid critique of "PCness" - but it still bears pointing out that most of the people who whine about the "PC police" ARE in fact just bigots who hate being criticized for THAT.

Decades on from Civil Rights legislation, and there are still plenty of racists in America - you CAN'T legislate enlightenment. But you CAN make it illegal to deny rights to people based on \textbf{race}, if you fight for that hard enough. And of course the racists will hate you for it, and call you names and insist that THEY'RE being oppressed by your denial of their prerogative to oppress you...but FUCK 'EM! (I'm not \textbf{black} either...lol. These are actual principles, not me trying to arbitrarily make myself the center of the universe to whom everybody else must kowtow.)Speaking of which, as for calling people bigots, it's just a case of "if the jumper fits" (Kim Davis reference). It's an English word with a definite meaning. I mean, I routinely see "conservatives" in comment sections saying things like "Lazy \textbf{black} welfare queen thugs are the REAL racists!" without a trace of irony. Touche.BTW there's a reason for a bigot to transcend his bigotry for his own sake - because bigotry is a form of willed stupidity.

Since advertising is primarily aimed at women, men in commercials are also now routinely depicted as either being emasculated losers or stupefied morons. Young men consuming this content grow up thinking that it is acceptable and even encouraged to aspire to these character traits. In doing so, they are robbed of their natural masculinity and find it extremely difficult to attract well-rounded women, who are rightly disgusted by such behavior. The entertainment industry is largely controlled by men, again underscoring the fact that this assault is a top down trend that has little or \textbf{nothing} to do with the \textbf{gender} war.Second wave feminism was a creation of the establishment itself and at its core has little whatsoever to do with genuine concern about women's rights. Radical feminism deliberately confuses \textbf{gender} roles and makes young men apprehensive about exercising their masculinity for fear of being seen as overbearing or aggressive towards women. This has contributed to an entire generation of 'metrosexual' men who are \textbf{promiscuous}, unwilling to commit to a relationship and unable to fulfil a women's basic needs for healthy companionship, destabilizing society and making it more difficult for women to find suitable long term partners with whom to have children.2) Masculinity as a Dirty WordDissident feminist Camille Paglia recently wrote a Wall Street Journal piece in which she warned, 'What you're seeing is how a civilization commits suicide.' Paglia was referring to how the emancipation of masculine virtues by the establishment threatens to create massive destabilization in society due to less and less men being able to fill traditionally 'masculine' roles in the jobs market. Paglia points to schools cutting recess, the effort to deny the biological distinctions between men and women, and the left's characterization of controversial opinions as 'hate speech' as examples of how masculinity is being deliberately eroded. 'Masculinity is just becoming something that is imitated from the movies. There's \textbf{nothing} left. There's no room for anything manly right now,' warns Paglia, adding that young men have, 'no models of manhood.would you ever consider calling women dicks, cocks, dickheads, pricks, wankers etc., the way you call men pussies and cunts?
