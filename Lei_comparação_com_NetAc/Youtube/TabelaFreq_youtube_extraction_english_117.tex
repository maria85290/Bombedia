  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I'm turning 30 in a few weeks and I've never been more depressed. I think it's because I graduated college late and started my career late, no relationship right now. I feel like I wasted my 20s. Older folks still tell me 30s are young and I definitely don't feel 30, but it's the first time younger adults will see me as "\textbf{old}" .

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small some aspects of the human condition are relevant to the \textbf{age} of the person, some are not. to disrespect someone on the basis of their \textbf{age} is a fallacy. a person can contribute tremendous value to a society at every stage of their life. at each stage of a persons life they are likely to contribute in ways that are unique to that stage of their life. a twenty year \textbf{old} male that has the life goal of having a large family is not expected to marry a 65 year \textbf{old} female. a 65 year \textbf{old} machinist is likely to have a lot to teach to the next generation of 12 year olds. it is all about context.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}5/118 & \cellcolor{green!27}4.237 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small This is a load of BS, in my opinion. Everyone goes through \textbf{old} \textbf{age}, it's not a social construct or form of discrimination that affects one group of people. Comparing it to the other "isms" of the world is pretty ludicrous. And honestly, I don't think wanting to retain a youthful and healthy figure is something people can stop wanting naturally.  I've seen many \textbf{old} people who look better and are more active than these younger people because they took care of themselves and ate healthy. Most of the \textbf{old} people I see at the gym are fit and workout daily, which I give them props. We all have the power to control our destiny. I honestly believe that if you eat healthy,  stay active, save for retirement, becoming \textbf{old} wouldn't be that bad. Retaining youth  doesn't make you an \textbf{ageist}, it makes you smart because you're preparing for the future. What's stopping you from becoming  fit, financially well off, and spending your \textbf{old} years traveling instead of being in a nursing home eating pudding and sitting in a wheelchair?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I liked it when Ashton says "have you ever been to a party and headed for people your own \textbf{age}...all these behaviours are \textbf{ageist}, we all do them and we can't challenge bias unless we're aware of it".

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Women are the same bitches who took advantage of \textbf{ageism} when they were younger. They didn't need to pay a mover to switch apartments because they had young men to move stuff for them. They didn't have to pay for dinners or drinks in bars. But THEN as they got older, things weren't handed to them anymore. They hadn't developed their minds in preparation¬†for being on their own. Even Sally Field was complaining about \textbf{ageism}. Well, guess what? Field got her start as Gidget on TV. She was an 18-year-\textbf{old} who looked sixteen and that's WHY she got the part. And she took that part, then the Flying Nun, and moved on to be an A-list actress. It all started with Gidget, and looking young. Maybe Gale Storm wanted the Gidget part but she was too \textbf{old} for it.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Ageism, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}3/140 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.143 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small As an enemy of most of the Social Justice Workers ideas I have to say that her speech wasn't bad at all. She said that illness and real problems older people must face are true, but besides of that we shouldn't feel worse just because of the \textbf{age}. I understood is as a message: don't let that nocebo works. A lot of people are absolutely healthy and their body is still in a good shape, but they feel \textbf{old} just because they know they are 40 or 50+. And they start to behave like \textbf{old}, ill people. This is what this \textbf{woman} mentioned: as long as your body can work properly (and sometimes it's possible to the end of the life), don't let your spirit feel \textbf{old} and don't behave like you will die soon.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small What a load of garbage.  This is a perfect example of SJW philosophy.  Just tell yourself something until you feel better about yourself even if it's not true.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Remember, just because some SJWs hijacked all the "isms" and argue that "all straight white males are pretty much all isms", does not mean that they don't exist at all. Don't let exaggerations like that fool you into thinking a pervasive issue like \textbf{ageism} does not deserve attention. I might disagree with the SJWs in how to then address the issue, but I would never argue that it does not exist or is not important.To suggest \textbf{ageism} doesn't affect behavior is silly. Why do you think anti-aging products exist? I don't think they are some sort of crime against humanity like some people seem to, but I do think it's a symptom of an underlying beauty standard disfavoring the \textbf{old}. The fact that people are prepared to pay top dollar for such items shows that these impacts are not so esoteric after all. People really do care, the impact is real and measurable. After all, a beauty standard is largely a cultural construct; other cultures have had vastly different ideas about beauty than the current Western culture.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Ageism, Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}3/178 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.685 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Ralph Schraven Very nice comment. I don't deny \textbf{ageism} doesn't exist and it certainly has a huge impact. All I'm saying is that when we compare a young person and \textbf{old} person in most cases the \textbf{old} person is gonna be slower, less attractive, less fit. So our stereotypes are best on our observation of the world. I'm not saying someone should be treated differently because of their \textbf{age} I'm saying it's natural to assume these things. I'm also not saying that we don't have a problem with what media tells us about who is beatiful and who's not.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Ageism, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}4/99 & \cellcolor{green!5}4.04 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I enjoyed this speech a lot. I agree with the point that culture shapes how individuals look at aging. In Western cultures, older individuals are not seen as valuable members of society anymore. In other cultures, growing \textbf{old} is an honor and younger individuals hold them in reverence for their knowledge and wisdom. Aging in America is seen as a loss of life, in a way... all we see are anti-aging everything BUT an anti-aging diet, but that's another conversation. I will piggy back another poster in that the sociological construct of \textbf{ageism} is created; however as we \textbf{age}, processes change...its a biological fact. Not everything is \textbf{ageism}, just like not everything is \textbf{racism}, \textbf{sexism} or \textbf{homophobia}. There is an overuse of -ism's in American society now. Sometimes, facts hurt... but that does not negate the reality that they are facts.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Ageism, Homophobia, Old, Racism, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General, Sexual Identity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}7/141 & \cellcolor{green!5}4.965 \\  \hline

Discrimination against \textbf{old} people is deeply rooted on all of those prejudices we all have against \textbf{old} \textbf{age}, imparted by the same media that has affected how we view \textbf{gender}, \textbf{race}, etc. We see aging as an impairment, a disease that needs to be isolated even, and as part of our culture, this view on \textbf{age} DOES affect how they feel, their productivity and generates more issues in their health.

She lies about things such as the effects of \textbf{age} on the human body and reinforces it with popular SJW beliefs. The fact is, aging DOES have negative effects on the human body. Its not a social construct, and its not just a market that these so called big pharmaceutical companies have pushed on people. It's science. As people \textbf{age}, the  telomeres that act as a cap for the end of a chromosome begin to shorten with each replication as a person ages, causing each new cell to be more damaged than the last. Now Im not going to try and tell you that the nullment of her argument makes it ok to dehumanize \textbf{old} people, but frankly, I dont think that happens too much anyway. If a person is going to dehumanize someone, theyre going to do it to just about anyone, \textbf{black}, white, \textbf{old}, young, republican, democrat, you name it. "\textbf{Ageism}", \textbf{racism}, \textbf{sexism}, all just convenient mediums of dehumanization. So really, this \textbf{woman} is not preaching to the young white males of the world as she may think, but rather, she is preaching to the irrational people of the world (no those are not interchangeable) and those people arent going to change.

That's stronger than my personal interest in California's secession, heightened though it is by Trump's election. Of course, secession would have several advantages and some disadvantages to California and its citizens. However, I haven't researched this carefully, because it's not realistically possible for any state to secede. I was voicing my frustration with the fact that the U.S. is not a democracy but a republic. Specifically, the Electoral College, not the people, elect the president. We got George W. Bush with 47 of the popular vote as president, instead of Al Gore with 51, and Donald Trump with 46 instead of Hilary Clinton with 55. In practical terms, George W. Bush was elected by the Supreme Court 5 to 4, by its decision to stop the recount of votes in Florida.This has \textbf{nothing} to do with my feelings.

The rest of the video is entirely biased, talking about \textbf{ageism} from the perspective that it's a phenomenon that negatively impacts people as they get older, that \textbf{ageism} is discrimination against older people. This wasn't even remotely close to being an even-handed presentation.She's full of it, just talking her book. When she starts talking about all the privileges that older people have, I'll start listening. Maybe then she could investigate what happens when politicians start talking about taking those special privileges away in the interests of fairness (which is what she should call for if she wants to truly fight for age-based equality). I've seen it first hand. It's us oldies who protest the most and fight tooth and nail to keep our special privileges.

Aside from that, \textbf{ageism} goes far beyond the workplace. Many Americans just assume older people are less capable, "pathetic", simply because of their \textbf{age}. What's sad is that like American \textbf{racism}, \textbf{ageism} is simply an outgrowth of fear. \textbf{Ageist} hate \textbf{old} people because they fear becoming them.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Ageism, Ageist, Old, Racism & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}7/72 & \cellcolor{green!27}9.722 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small More than that, \textbf{Ageism} is a cultural construct. " If the culture changes in a way that no longer supports judging people by their \textbf{age}, then \textbf{ageism} will wither away.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small End \textbf{ageism} and one must accept abortion as murder.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I am aware citizenship is currently conferred by the passage through the magical mystery canal by those who observe this religiously while denying the magical transubstantiation of chunks of carbs and fermented grape juice into the remnants of a reanimated god.  This is merely an extension of \textbf{ageism} for the convenience of justifying murder.  Which as Doe v. Bolton and Roe v. Wade determine is the right of a \textbf{woman} to do to her child, even after it has passed through the magical mystery canal.And DNA became the method of identifying a human being for the purposes of determining life and death in legal cases when Timothy W. Spencer was executed on the basis of DNA for his identity.  If you have a complete DNA then you have an identifiable human being who may be executed or exonerated on the basis of that identity.  This identification of persons did not exist at the time of Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton or it would have changed the outcome of the cases because it would have changed the definition of what is a person.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Since 30 to 50 percent or more fertilized eggs are naturally aborted with normal menstruation, your notion that at conception one must treat a fertilized egg as if it had all the moral equivalence of a fully formed human child is so extreme as to be laughable.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small "a \textbf{woman} must be free to make when it comes to child bearing."No person "MUST" be free.  That is pseudo-reasoning at its best.  A person might be allowed to be free or justifiably free.  But there is no compulsion of nature that forces a mandate for a person to be free.  All person give up their freedom to function as sole actors in moral and ethical decision making the moment they enter into a community of others.  A person is free to make moral decisions that affect no one else solely when they live utterly independent and devoid of all interactions with all others.  That "complexity" you mention has no value because those whom she affects in her decision making have no legal authority for redress when her decisions harm them physically, sexually, intellectually, and/or emotionally."fertilized eggs are naturally aborted with normal menstruation"Acts of nature have no moral conviction.  This is a \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} herring.  And the correct term would be miscarried not aborted.  This is a straw man you conflated into the \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} herring.\textbf{Nothing} in what you stated is valid ethical or moral reasoning.  It is only self-serving argument for a feminist lobby intent on maintaining a practice which is ethically more repugnant than slavery.  Slavery denied human beings liberty which denied them the pursuit of happiness.  Abortion denies identifiable human beings life which denies them liberty which denies them their choice to pursue happiness.You have an option.  Either 1) Homosexuality is an abnormal result of genetics resulting in the \textbf{sexual} identity of the person being driven by genetic outcomes, or 2) homosexuality is the result of experiential training on a mind that is tabula rasa.

\textbf{\Large Result analysis:}

\begin{itemize}\item Taking into account the words that were detected, we can reach the conclusion these comments are associated with : : Age - General;Age - Over 65s;Nationality - General;Age - Youngsters;Ethnicity - Native-American; Ideological and Political Identity - General;Ethnicity - General;Gender - General;Sexual Identity - General;Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments;Social Class - Working class;Social Class - General;Ethnicity - Black;Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality;Ethnicity - Asian (East- China, Japan, Korea, Philippines, Vietnam);Sexual Identity - Transexuality;Sexual Identity - Female homosexuality;Gender - Female sexuality;Gender - Female age and physical appearance;%.

\item The percentage of hate speech related words is 2.4206.

\item Considering that the variable \textbf{Age - General} has the most occurences in the post, we can interpret that this is the predominant hate speech.

\item Overall there were 359/407 occurences of hate speech related comments.\end{itemize}\end{document}
