  \cellcolor{green!5}\small There are so many people in the comments here who don't realize people in their mid to late 30s are actually just the oldest Millennials. lol We've been infantilized for so long that people think Millennials are still teenagers when that's actually Gen-Z. There's been several times since I turned 30 that I've had younger people respond to my dissenting opinion with \textbf{nothing} but "You're 3  " (whatever specific \textbf{age} I am at the time), as though that's a valid response to negate everything I just said, even when the topic was how pointless it is to be toxic to strangers (which you'd think life benefits of how you act would be something an older person would be qualified to speak on out of life experience alone). It's idiotic and only tells me the person isn't worth conversing with anyway, and the same goes for anybody who pounces on physical appearance instead of substance. It's like... okay? Go ahead and act that way towards me, you're only making yourself look stupid without me actually having to engage you.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small This method of undermining a person's argument is called ad hominem. I've seen it be used against dozens of people, including politicians that focus on others instead of themselves. It's a logical fallacy that you have to call out to hopefully break.

The same is for perfect, flawless looking people. Just because they are \textbf{skinny} and sound as suave as a slick blade does not mean they have well constructed or valid points.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small It has \textbf{nothing} to do with stereotypes Rich, or even \textbf{age} for that matter. But more to do with people who have no moral or ethical values because their parents taught them to hate the world. Call it whatever you like, but its flat out harassment, and unfortunately Google empowers hatred on Youtube by allowing it. Unfortunately, this is what happens when you have a system where there's virtually no rules of engagement, people will crap on each other. It also doesn't matter what one's opinion is, hateful humans will always find a reason to preach more hate, its all they know. Just last night I expressed my opinion for the issues surrounding firearms in the U.S, and one response was literally laced with profanity and threats.

Do these younger idiots think they have a better grip on technology and video games because they've been doing it for maybe 10 years, vs someone like Rich who has been living and breathing it for 30+??
