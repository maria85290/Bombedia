Similarly, in recent news reports, an associate of El Chapo claimed that President PeÃ±a Nieto was bribed 100 million dollars, as reporting that he had been bribed 1.9 billion pesos would not have been very helpful to the intended audience in conveying the scale of the bribe. I suppose if this had been a Mexican channel, it would have made perfect sense to report that her death is going to cost tens of billons of pesos.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Ah, yes. Of course, the US. Here's the thing:The US is certainly the mightiest \textbf{nation}. I myself am completely in support of it and possess very friendly feelings towards its place as the current hegemony and in general have \textbf{nothing} but kind things to say about its commitment to its ideals. And its among good company. The Roman Republic, for example was very similar in terms of might and foreign policy in some respects--being The Big Boy of the Mediterranean world. Being much stronger than the kingdoms that surrounded and preceded it. There's \textbf{nothing} that says that a Republic can't be great and powerful--in fact, republic institutions tend to do wonders for the productivity and economy of a \textbf{nation}.  But, as with a lot of things, there's a breaking point. A period when everything falls apart. All governments? Monarchies, Aristocracies, and yes, Democracies? Eventually atrophy. They decay. As a simple effect of time, everything gets corrupted and muddled and in-need of a good fix. Governments are tools. Tools get worn-out. How did the Roman Republic fall and \textbf{transition} into the Roman Empire? Why was it necessary? Because the Republic and its institutions, as honorable as its ideals were, eventually broke down and proved itself vulnerable to the wills of ambitious men and their support bases. Even before Caesar, it was already up a point where hardly any progressive legislation could be passed without currying favor from the right people in the right factions. In this environment? It's understandable there would be public dissatisfaction and disenchantment. \textbf{Nothing} was being done. People were going hungry. Traffic was getting worse, the local officials were getting more and more  shameless, and taxes still had to be paid. Is it really any wonder that the people would end up falling for personalities instead of ideals? Tying their own successes to successes of a particular individual regardless of what ideals they represent? How's it doing now in America? Political deadlock. \textbf{Nothing} gets done. \textbf{Nothing} important anyway. Bureaucrats and Party Goons have gamed the system. People hate their elected officials--and yet they keep getting reelected anyway. Any progress made by one party gets undone with the election of someone from a rival one. And its understandable. After all, the last thing you want is to weaken you and your parties chances at reelection by keeping a policy from your enemy people actually like. If you can't steal it? Get rid of it. And this will keep happening. Ad nauseam. In perpetuity. America will take one step forward? Two steps back. Then 3 steps forward? Then one step back. Incrementally getting better? And incremental getting worse.  And pissing people off more and more--because no one cares about them or their problems. The solutions people want? Are different from the solutions their leaders in the system want. People are coming from different value sets? And everyone's getting desperate for a change. For a savior. Because people know that sometimes it doesn't take a committee to solve a problem--but a decisive decision-maker. And that's when your populists come in. As a matter of simple consequence. There comes a time in every Republic's life when the power struggle becomes defined and streamlined. It stops being a fight between ideals and policies and more of a simple power struggle between coalitions and their united power-bases. Everyone wants the top spot. Everyone wants to be the one who gets to say what is and is not done. And they will never stop until they get it. Damn everyone else who just wants people to come to a goddamn decision! And heading these factions? Are the populists. People who will say anything to get elected. They're more rival generals than they are countrymen. And eventually their power still either equal each other so completely that they can veto and outvote each other constantly--or one of them will become so powerful that the whole system becomes a sham. That's what the Monarch is there for. To curb the capriciousness of the ambitious by ubiquitously taking it away from them--and making it so that the monarch's acquisition of it? Isn't tied to something as malleable and fickle as public opinion. A monarch  does not care about public opinion--at least not in a way that a politician does. The Monarch only needs people to be supportive and friendly towards the institution and the institution whom the monarch borrowed its majesty from--like the Church. A person will remain a monarch regardless of their popularity with the public. They do not depend on popularity or being clever with their words--they merely have to be. They merely have to be respectful of the institutions of State and mindful of their dignity. It's all kabuki, my friend. All theater and performance. But it's an important performance. And the part a monarch plays? Is essentially one between a high priest and as a mascot for the State and its values. A living human face for the soul of a \textbf{nation}. And as such? They can make decisions that politicians and elected officials could not. Not, leaving decisions to a fucking mascot whose leadership ability is dependent of a genetic lottery would be idiotic in an Absolute Monarchy. But in a constitutional/parliamentary one? It's different. Having the king of queen or emperor be a blubbering, sad mediocrity could be considered ideal. Because it's not the head below the crown that's important. It's the crown itself.  Let's say political deadlock happens and neither side wants to back down. The people are unhappy. And so they decide to write their sovereign about their problems with the government and how frustrated they are. If implored and with enough public support? The  monarch can be requested to dissolve an ineffective government and order new elections. Which they can do (theoretically). And the monarch will do this? Because the monarch only cares about keeping itself a monarch and keeping people friendly towards the institution of the crown. It gives ambitious people something to look-out for. A reminder. A reminder that they're not untouchable and that they can't just talk or scheme their way into becoming Boss of the \textbf{Nation}--without incurring the wrath of someone they can't touch.Now, while modern Constitutional Monarchies are far from the most powerful states in the world now? They are among the most stable, happy, and effective. And, I believe? It's partly because of this aspect of their office. Those who want to be the heads of government along with their parties can be as fear-mongering and capricious as those found in a pure republic--but they do have to be more mindful because their true head of state can theoretically remove them anytime they do something truly stupid. In this way, I see the monarch as a way to protect democratic institutions. A safeguard. It's essentially a way for people to prevent the need for a dictator by giving them a softer out in case things got really shit.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nation, Nothing, Transition & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Nationality - General, Sexual Identity - Transexuality & \cellcolor{green!5}9/1157 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.778 \\  \hline

All of what you have said seems to ignore the very real fact of evolution. That ancient monarchs may very well have behaved in the ways you describe, but as time has passed they've become much less extreme. Like how the Queen can't just declare war willy nilly. And she can't just raise taxes, modern monarchs aren't autocrats and have realistic bounds on their power. And since you used the past tense 'was' I assume you understand that attitude no longer permeates monarchy. And, though I've also mentioned Scottish independence, don't see it's relevance to this conversation. Because no \textbf{nation} would realistically want independence because they had a monarch.

You continue on with this 'obsolescence' argument, but since obsolete means out of fashion or no longer in use, I would say that monarchy is in no way obsolete. I would suggest you watch King Charles III, an excellent movie which perfectly showcases the power of the monarchy and it's precarious balance with Parliament.I agree with you on scientists, \textbf{doctors}, secularism etcetera. But I don't see it's relevance to this argument. Though Lords Spiritual do occupy part of the House of Lords, there is a clear divide between church and state here in the UK. Unlike somewhere like Saudi Arabia. If by 'superstition' you mean practices like zodiac, I agree. If you mean religion, I disagree.

It's a bit hard when the Venus project's a channel to know what I should watch.In the meantime, technocracy (as described on Wikipedia) is 'a system of governance where decision-makers are selected on the basis of their expertise in their areas of responsibility'. It sounds great on the surface, but there are issues that can be raised. Who will appoint them? Clearly not the people, since they don't have the objective skills and knowledge to do so. An easy fix would be to have previous leaders appoint them, but this would hamper a budding technocracy since the people would object to someone with a political alignment that isn't in line with theirs appointing a leader without any oversight. And of course, the public gets no choice over what issues they tackle since they've been appointed to lead the country. There is one example I can think of where a technocratic leader had succeeded. When George VI appointed Winston Churchill as PM after Neville Chamberlain's withdrawal. And since that turned out great, it puts a few holes in your argument about appointing 'average' people.As such Technocracy is untried and untested and unless you can find a large population of willing \textbf{Guinea} \textbf{pigs}, it won't be tested.I don't see how I'm regressive, that would imply that I want to reverse societal and scientific advancement.

However, the proposed society would be almost \textbf{communist}, which would place heavy expectations upon anyone in a position of power to be totally incorruptible.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small She's there for a heck of a lot more than "tradition".Legally, she must give her assent for a bill that has passed Parliament to become law.According to Bagehot, the monarch has three main rights: the right to be consulted (meaning the government isn't supposed to keep secrets from the king or queen), the right to encourage, and the right to warn.  While the monarch can't order the government to do or not do something, they can certainly make their feelings known. And with the weekly meetings with the Prime Minister, the monarch can help ensure that the PM is actually staying on top of things.  Both John Major and Tony Blair have commented that, on occasions when they weren't as prepared on some subject as they should have been, the Queen made it abundantly clear that at the next meeting, they had better be able to fully answer the questions she put to them.And while normally the leader of the party that gets the most seats in Parliament is asked to form a government, it is still the Queen's ultimate decision.  In 1963, Harold Macmillan, citing illness, unexpectedly resigned as Prime Minister.  Because the Tories had no formal process for picking a leader, Macmillan's deputy, Rab Butler didn't automatically become leader of the party-but a PM had to be selected.  So, she consulted with \textbf{senior} party leaders and picked Alec Douglas-Home\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Senior & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}1/234 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.427 \\  \hline

Their \textbf{nation} has occupied a position as a world leader and I respect them. But I ask, why are we modernizing a monarchy? We're a democratic planet. Kings and Queens don't rule over us anymore. We are free to earn our place in the world, free from absolute rulers in any form. This is my only concern, overshadowed by respect and goodwill. I welcome any input and I offer this only as schoroly thought.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I think that the main reason that most people (including me) love the Queen and the Monarchy in general, is because she is a figurehead. Let me explain. In modern republics, your head of state is chosen max every 5 years ( I think). Thus it is quite hard to feel \textbf{nationalism} in that country, as the very person who should represent your national identity is someone who won't be there in 5 years time. In other words, Presidents etc are country leaders who represent the people but not the culture. This is why I think the republic is flawed in ONLY the fact that it ignores the centuries of monarchies which built said \textbf{nation} up, and whilst there may be a few bad apples in terms of kings or queens the majority is positive and has the thoughts of the \textbf{nation} at heart. That's why a constitutional monarchy like we have in the UK is in my opinion the best choice, because, not only does it keep the values, traditions, and even the family that have built it in the last hundreds of years, give you a figurehead that will be there for a long time to feel national pride towards, but also provides the liberty and democracy which I believe is a basic human right.Also...God save the Queen\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nation, Nationalism & \cellcolor{green!5}Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/222 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.351 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Actually John, country debt means very little, and please stop trying to tell people they are idiots for pointing this out.Debt for a country is a little misleading. The majority of the debt that the US holds is to it's own citizens, in the form of bonds. Also countries don't really "Borrow" the same way(Well not usually anyway) you or I would.Instead a country will just offer more bonds for sale, which anyone including other countries can buy. This isn't always the case, but the majority of the time it is. Debt owed to places like China, Norway or any other country you can list is all "voluntary" and has economic returns for debt holders. The US still has to pay the interest regardless of any debt that anyone holds. So a country, or you yourself taking out a bond, you give X number of dollars, and the US promises to give you Y on specific intervals without fail. You know, sort of like a savings account where you would put in money you can't touch, but you get a return until you want to sell the debt. Which is also another thing, if China for example wanted to sell it's bonds, two things could and would occur. They would be put onto the open market for others to buy, other countries, individuals etc, and any unsold bonds would be either paid by the US, or put on a schedule to return.Also debt is a little misleading. Say I owe you 5,000\$, and you owe me 4,000\$. How much do I owe you? 1,000\$ right?Wrong. I owe you 5,000\$, and you owe me 4,000\$, which while effectively I actually owe you 1,000\$ this is not how countries treat debt. While China owns a lot of US Bonds and other types of debt, the US also owns a lot of Chinese bonds and other types of debt. The US Debt is 17 trillion without factoring in what other countries OWE the US. In the end all countries effectively have some sort of debt, and in a lot of cases the debt is a wash, in a lot of other cases it's imbalanced. The US is not nearly in balance for it's out and in.Regardless in the end what matters isn't debt, but GDP to debt ratio. As long as you can continue to pay interest, no one cares. Also no one country owns so much debt that it could \textbf{cripple} the US if they demanded it all back immediately. Other countries would absorb some debt, citizens would absorb it, and a certain portion in the worst case scenario would be either skipped to be paid at later date, or put into schedule.Of course that effects the credit rating, but in the end a countries debt isn't what you think it is.Also this was a brief overview, it goes insanely in depth and i'm barely scratching the surface.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small By "Secret" they mean a plan they haven't told the public because it would cause distress. Few people, if anyone can give a first-hand account of a queen before the currently reigning one. As such simply stating "We have a plan in place for when she dies" would make some people upset because they don't want to think about such a long-lasting monarch passing on (Especially one whom people seem to like as much as her) It's like if the United States government were to just come out and say "This is our plan for world war 3" odds are there is already a plan in place to prevent all-out nuclear war from destroying the planet the second a large war starts, but \textbf{nobody} wants to be blatantly told that by Donald Trump (or anyone else for that matter.) So instead they keep it as a "Secret" protocol... It's something everyone knows is in place because it'd be fucking stupid to not have in place, but it'd be just as stupid to say it out loud because it could incite violence, panic, and chaos. It's the same reason government officials refuse to comment on Extra-Terrestrial life. We have scientists in the government who watch and test theories of unidentified flying objects, but they won't admit to it because the existence of other life or even the thought that we are trying to look for it could send some people into a crazed frenzy. On one hand you would have the "righteous" religious people who believe that we are the only intelligent species in the universe trying to attack the government for looking for extra-terrestrial life the same way they attack the government for protecting \textbf{L\textbf{G\textbf{BT}}} rights or moving the United States away from being a country with a benchmark religion. On the other hand you have people who may start rioting when they realize that possibly billions of U.S. Dollars (a.k.a. YOUR money through taxes) go towards funding secret projects that look for life that they themselves don't believe in. I can't talk to your beliefs personally since I don't know you, but assume you are someone adamantly against abortion and you find out that your tax-payer dollars are being used to scrape up a fetus. You wouldn't be too happy about that would you? Overall these protocols aren't "Secret" in the sense that they are never told to anyone and always kept under lock and key. But instead they are things that the world generally knows but don't want to acknowledge for the sake of making life easier. \textbf{Nobody} wants to sit around all day and read their mom's last will and testament over and over again waiting until the day that their mother dies. By the same note \textbf{nobody} wants to hear the plan for when the queen dies over and over because it's just not something you want to think of on a daily basis. It's something you want to keep out of your mind to keep yourself happy while also knowing there is a plan already in place so things won't immediately fall to chaos the second it happens.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}LGBT, Nobody & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Sexual Identity - General, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality, Sexual Identity - Transexuality & \cellcolor{green!27}6/523 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.147 \\  \hline

Obama set it up so that if you don't get health insurance, you are heavily fined from your tax return that we need to pay bills etc.  I didn't want Insurance. But I and to get it. It's 2,700 \$ a year. That's a 10th of my salary. I don't see a cent of help from the insurance unless I rack up medical bills over \$5,000. After that they pay a small percentage until I spent 6500\$ total. THEN they pay 90 of the rest of the bill. I have to pay full price for office visits, medication, etc. So literally unless I'm in a catastrophic accident I am flushing my money down the toilet.  I could've saved that money back and pay for all my medical bills with a shitload left over.   Plus after Obama he had driven the races even further apart. He has given the terrorists millions of dollars for literally \textbf{nothing}. In my opinion he had been the WORST president for us. And you only have an outsiders opinion. Your opinion is shit because you don't live here. You're not being called a \textbf{racist} bigot for merely being born white. The \textbf{racism} has grown exponentially in this country. Blacks were convinced that whites are the issue- and whites are pissed off that blacks are blaming them for everything which fuels their \textbf{racism} too. We are in the verge of a civil war. And do you know whose presidency this all happened in? Obama. He was rewardinf the lazy and the sluts with 12 baby daddies. Raised benefits to able bodied people whi didnt want to work. Im all for supporting the \textbf{elderly} and \textbf{disabled}. Im not talking about those. There is a high entitlment mentality going on here. Peooke expect to pop out kids left and right and have someone else pay instead of the father. This si also taking away money from the \textbf{elderly} and \textbf{disabled}. And all the money im putting into social security for MY retirement is being given away so quickly that more than likely I will never see a dime back from it becaise the system will collapse at this rate. We had obama who refused to vet the people coming in from countried that are known to be \textbf{terrorist} ridden.

Now we have muslims terrorists bombing people and starting to try to force cities into Shariah law which directly contradicts our constitutional rights. But liberals are too \textbf{pussy} to refise them cause theyre scared to be called \textbf{racist}. Trump is slowly trying to turn things arounds. And hes doing a great job!

And having 2 pplitical parties that never agree on anything this is a major thing to elect a president. Evllif we dont like how the cou trys being ran we have a chance every 4 year to change it. This is why promoting change is good because not everyone can agree on the same things here. Its fair. We have many many nationalities, views, and personalities in this countrym we are a hodge podge of different cultures and beliefs so we will never agree. This so why having an elected representative is So important and that's why they campaign. And not gonna lie, many Americans are \textbf{dumb} as hell. If we solely depended on electing every member of congress all the time like we do a president, it would be chaos. The mass of the people vote for president only. Not Congress because the president picks people he thinks will follow him while maintaining a balance of parties. Picking a bunch of people each time gets confusing and we'll end up with a bunch of different views. Seeing how the majority of Congress has to vote in agreeance to pass something, \textbf{nothing} would ever be passed. We need a single voice to guide it all along. But Presidents can be "overthrown" through impeachment. So they're not just going to do whatever they want willy nilly. Plus they'll want to be reelected so it not wise to piss off the people. technically The president CAN just pass something on his own without vote BUT he can easily be impeached if we find it wrong so there's not just no consequences for their actions.

If you were to become a republic and replace the Queen with a President, you'd have to pay tax money to maintain the institution of a Presidency. The American presidency costs more to run PER YEAR than the British monarchy for the last 100 years (literally, it costs \$1bn each year for the president, the monarchy can fund itself for 25 years on that amount) Why the heck wouldn't you choose to keep a monarch?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The Divine Right of Kings was a doctrine used in most Catholic monarchies. But the reason why all monarchs in Europe sit on their throne is NOT because they claim they were called by God. Every royal house in Europe is related to Charlemagne who was ELECTED as Holy Roman Emperor. His peers CHOSE him by popular vote to sit on Europe's thrones. He split up his various lands among his children and each kingdom went its separate way.The Divine Right of Kings was studied and developed by James I, but very few monarchs claim their right to rule because God wills it these days. The Divine right is a really piss weak argument -- the Queen is the Queen because the masses respect her family and lineage and because her family is the most powerful in the Kingdom. Royal houses must be wealthier and more powerful than their subjects or they would be overtaken by rival Kingdoms. The Divine Right has \textbf{nothing} to do with monarchy these days, she is the head of the church in a ceremonial position and that's about it. If we didn't want the House of Windsor then we'd say so and push them off and elect another family line to the throne, but no such family is rivaling the Windsors so it doesn't matter.

Mints handle exclusively coins, and again regularly change the patterns and processes though not usually for any pragmatic reason. Special coins celebrating something are quite \textbf{common}, also the picture of the Queen used on the coins has been updated as she has aged. Most importantly notes and coins DO NOT suddenly cease being legal tender just because a new version comes out. Coins marked with Elizabeth's head will still be in circulation decades from now.

The \textbf{old} ones will still be used and they won't produce any greater number of new currency than they normally would. The only reason all the notes and coins currently in circulation have the present Queen on is that during her reign as it's been so long, all the \textbf{old} notes and coins have gradually been updated (like recently with the new pound coin) meaning none of the ones around before her time are legal tender any more. There was a time right up until the 1970s before the currency was decimalised that you still occasionally found very \textbf{old} coins with Queen Victoria on them in your change!

In fact, a lot of the royal family either serve in three military or are Olympians for Great Britain. Let's not even get started on the charities and organisations set up by the royals.

Are you telling me that if you built a house it wasn't yours? It's the same premise. They built a kingdom, that's why they're royals.

If you want someone to be angry at, be angry at the rich companies and banks who own loooooads of land and swathes of homes to rent to people, and take it from them the second they don't pay.Also again, we get money FROM the royal family BECAUSE they rent the land to us. It would be WORSE if they didn't rent it us.

There's not a single country or religion who isn't guilty of this. There's no point getting all sour because of the past. Why get all upset about something that has been stopped? Colonisation was one of the things the United Nations aimed to deconstruct, which is why many countries no longer have their overseas colonies now. You have to realise that ethics and human rights are relatively recent things in human history right? It's not as simple as, "Oh, why did they do slavery, they should've been good people." Back then they didn't even see the slaves as on their level, as human. We have come VERY far.Why should the royal families be stripped of their status? It's part of the culture and they don't RULE anymore. So it makes no sense. Why do you think they do \textbf{nothing} but sit on their ass all day using their wealth? You know that CEOs and greedy company owners are the main ones that do that right? Them and corrupt politicians? The Queen has done a LOT for the UK. She fought in WW2, can you say you've done that? She makes money for the UK, that's how she works. You're just making up shit because you think that royal = power hungry evil. They have NO power. We pay them money because they rent us land, that's it. That's how it works. If we don't, we'll end up paying MORE money. Most of the entire world are democracies! To join certain international treaties, alliances and organisations you have to BE a democracy. If you have an issue with that go look at the warlords in central Africa!We are speeding towards the most peaceful era of human history and you're still hung up on what has past.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small No, I just fucking said, the money comes from the Royal Estates. When you hear in the news that "Â£2,000,000 of taxpayers money" is being used to repair Buckingham Palace, ALL of that money comes from ONE taxpayer, HM The Queen, who pays more tax as a percentage than anyone else in the country. The tax she pays per year is far, far more than is used for the upkeep of the Royal Family - and she is the only one who legally doesn't have to pay tax. She CHOSE to do it to support her people.The Royal Estates actually legally belong to HM The Queen as an individual, if you removed the monarchy and the Queen became an ordinary citizen she would keep her estates and only need to pay a fraction of the amount of tax on them, like any other business in the country. We, as a \textbf{nation}, would make a net loss of approximately Â£300 Million in taxes each year if we abolished the Monarchy. If that happened, HM the Queen, and her family could live a FAR more opulent lifestyle than they do now, and do so in relative peace, without needing to work 350+ days a year well into their 90's. (HM The Queen attended that many Royal Engagements last year, don't you think she would rather a private life where she could've retired 30 years ago and spent it with her family? Her sense of duty and honour surpasses any other world leader, she is an inspiration to everyone who knows of her, and only bigots and fools decry her for being 'too rich'.People who hate the Monarchy have no financial reason to do so, they just hate people who they see as 'richer' than them, and ignore the countless benefits, financial, social and diplomatic that they bring to this country.And the money we make from the Royal Estates PALES in comparison to the unquantifiable billions that the Monarchy has brought to this country in the form of tourism.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nation & \cellcolor{green!5}Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/339 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.295 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small David SiitherismNo she can't. She can't dissolve parliament.  [LINK] The Act thus removes the traditional royal prerogative to dissolve Parliament, and repeals the Septennial Act 1715 as well as references in other Acts to the royal prerogative. The royal prerogative to prorogue parliament is not affected by the Act. The most she can do is discontinue a session.She technically commands the military but they don't answer to the monarch, they answer to the government, and if she tried to exercise control it would be a negative outcome for everyone, including her. Yeah, she can ignore laws, as they don't pertain to her. But the only thing she can do otherwise is give a royal pardon to a citizen.This is true about the Australian Constitutional Crisis, but she can no longer do this due to the act I mentioned above.Also I highly highly doubt those countries would become republics. You fail to realise that those countries WANT to have her as head of state, and be part of the commonwealth and allied with the UK. New Zealand had a referendum to change the flag from the union jack to something more unique and fitting for their culture and history, but most people in the country voted to keep the \textbf{old} flag. It's a sense of pride or something. Canadians too are similar, just because the queen dies doesn't mean they'll leave the realm. They will still be democracies under a constitutional monarchy, because they don't lose anything by being this way. Everyone assumes that they're part of the realm unwillingly but it's the opposite. It helps relations with the UK and there's no downside.

The Netherlands is also, a Unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy. The same as the UK.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Yes! It does matter! That was 40 years ago! She doesn't have the power to override or overthrow governments you fool! That happened in 1975! The cold war was still going on!  Do you know what else happened in 1975? 3 \textbf{terrorist} attacks in the form of bombs put the UK populace in a state of panic! It wasn't even her that dissolved the parliament! It was Governor General Sir John Kerr!My point here is, you're acting like that one event completely justifies the total fear of the queens power, when in reality she has very little. On the other hand, those you SHOULD be concerned about, corrupt politicians, greedy bankers and company owners, are less of an issue to you! Who's fault was the 2008 depression, the housing crisis? The queens? No! It was greedy bankers looking to make money by selling homes to risky individuals who would end up defaulting a lot on their mortgages, driving the price of houses around them down into the ground, and causing stable home owners to stop paying their mortgage! That was THEIR fault! And things like this STILL happen! It is they who have the power and they who are the danger!Here you are arguing the toss trying to say the queen has loads of absolute power that she can use whenever when she never really has! And yet if you look over the Atlantic, you have the top 1 of america holding 20 of its wealth. THEY are the worry. Not the queen. Because they have the money to affect politics. Fuck, just look at the whole net neutrality debacle, something that was supposed to be settled but now is trying to get forcibly undone by ISP companies with money through the FCC because they want to profit more? How is that NOT power?The last time a law was refused assent by the monarch was in 1707! By Queen Anne who blocked a bill settling militia in Scotland! Are you really gonna argue that the Queen, who is staunchly non-political, is gonna start refusing laws into assent, something that hasn't happened for 310 years?I'm going to reiterate here for your clarification, No, the queen cannot dissolve elected parliaments. Nor can ANYONE ELSE.No! She can't overthrow governments! That is the same as dissolving parliament! Which she can't do!No! She cannot override any laws! Simply laws do not apply to her! She can't just stop a law from functioning!Yes! She can technically refuse to sign a bill into law! Will she? No! Because that would hurt her interests, as well as the country!Yes! She can technically declare war! But doing so would spark a riot/revolt! So no, she really can't!She has no huge amount of power she can exercise. All of her powers are in theory, and are kept in check by the fact that she has to keep neutral for fear of angering the populace.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Terrorist & \cellcolor{green!5}Religious Identity - Muslim & \cellcolor{green!5}1/493 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.203 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small lmao it wasn't a gift though. Ranjit Singh, the Sikh ruler of Punjab, had the diamond in his possession after India fought to get it back. After his death and a tumultuous period of changing rulers, the Punjabi throne was given to Duleep Singh and his mother, Rani Jindan. Jindan was imprisoned by the British, who then proceeded to force Duleep to sign a legal document that amended the Treaty of Lahore which required him to give away the Koh-i-noor and all claim to sovereignty. Duleep was only 10. Additionally, the difference between the British being looted and raided and India being looted and raided is that Britain isn't experiencing any long term residual consequence from said loots and raids. Britain literally had control over India less than 100 years ago, caused famines that could have been prevented, created deindustrialization and economic stagnation, massacred Indians, and instituted \textbf{racist} and derogatory laws towards Indians within India.

According to the Antiquities and Art Treasure Act, 1972, the government can only ask for the retrieval of items that have been illegally exported post-independence. The Kohinoor was prior independence and certainly not illegally taken, thus the law does not allow the country to have retrieval rights.

The scripts from the Indus Valley Civilization remain undeciphered to this day, and most of you don't even have a fraction of knowledge of the history and culture of your North Eastern and Southern states.

She is also responsible for a lot of money flowing through the economy as a result of tourists coming to see Buckingham palace and the queen herself. The queen appears at charity events and travels internationally as a representative of the United Kingdom, both of which contribute to making the world a better place.

The reason United States citizens don't agree with a monarchy is because we're very patriotic and nationalistic, so we usually stick to what our fathers and their forefathers had so desperately fought to have, our independence.To note, I'm not saying the queen takes that away now but people dislike the idea of there being a queen for the very same reason people do like the queen.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I love how most people are questioning or saying the British are stupid for having a monarchy. Sure, reminting everything is gonna be great (not, but it'll be done over a long period of time) and they probably have money held back for that. However, the British have a monarchy because it is normal in our culture and history as well as being a tourist attraction kinda. Tourists wanna see the palace, or know about our royal family because not many countries today have proper royals. I spotted a comment about ethical diversity, Something about American being the most ethically diversed country, when really in the entire world, they are ranked 85, with UK being 109 and Canada being ranked 60... And Papa New \textbf{Guinea} Being first. So... Sure. Totally. But still. England have a Monarchy. I think it's cultural improvement.

YOU'RE FUCKED because there are barely any hospitals that can help you. and as if it wasn't enough, you can't manage to pay a private hospital, probably because you don't have money for it in the first place; because you paid your abusive taxes, to receive this shit treatment by the government.  you guys should be happy to be born in britain, one of the most developed and historically best provided countries in the world..   the monarchy isn't an outdated way of government. a monarch is the representation of the people's will, and if he doesn't have public support, he falls. that is why there is no space for corruption when you are a monarch...that is just MY opinion, the opinion of a humble brazilian that wishes to see the \textbf{old} Brazilian Empire restored. thanks for reading, don't take any of this serious as this is just my opinion, and i'm sorry if i offended you..\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Communist, Old, Red & \cellcolor{green!5} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - Native-American & \cellcolor{green!5}6/373 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.609 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small true. a monarch spends 15 years studying to become a skilled politician. a fine example is D. Pedro II (Last emperor of Brazil)he spoke around 27 languages, ruled for FIFTY EIGHT YEARS (He became a king when his father, D. Pedro I abdicated from the throne after portuguese royal pressure) and he assumed the throne when he was 5 years \textbf{old}. He studied his whole life, dragged the country out of misery, DECLARED INDEPENDENCE! and made it the 4th biggest economy in the world AND biggest military superpower in the globe.Sadly, after so many \textbf{communist} and democratic plots (probably arranged by the US..) he lost his claim to power and died 2 years later.. Today, we are a 2nd world country, underdeveloped. Sadly, that is the price you pay for removing such a great monach from power. Today we are ruled by a vampire (Michel Temer), who didn't get elected in the first place. He played a plot against Dilma Roussef(ancient \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} dinossaur that used to rule the country) and assumed  her spot in the presidency. Both of those know only how to speak portuguese, didn't make any kinds of great feats to earn their spots.Now you ask me: how did those \textbf{dumb} fucks get elected in the first place?It's very simple: When you have people so \textbf{dumb}, but SO \textbf{dumb}, that took a great monarch out of his throne to put IDIOTS and STUPID FUCKERS like those in the country's palace, WHO THE FUCK do you think they are going to elect?

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Ifan lusnn Fuck off with that bullshit. America has rich history, we've had multiple tribal nations in the distant past with large wars that have left many artifacts. When the Europeans arrived they made many large structures, forth and colonial buildings that are still around today. America had had many different people affect it and has influenced the world in the many ways we've been involved in it. There all sorts of cultural sights and sources in America, As I said before there's tons of historical sights and buildings with museums covering all sorts of topics. You could go to a presidential library and see all the big events that happened in their presidency. You could look up the successes of the robber barons and how they created their monopolies and made many great structures and inventions. Also the only reason you say America doesn't have any culture is because it's so diverse and the majority of it is consumed by the rest of the world. Every famous company you've seen is most likely American, same with the most successful TV shows and movies. You've just seen them outside of America so much you forget they're American. As I said America is diverse and is really a large melting pot of European, \textbf{African}, and Asian cultures. Then after that you have the broader regional cultures. For example in the north east you have the majority historical sights and a lot of cultural centers, the food is largely influenced by Italians as there are multitudes of restaurants that server great pizza and subs. The personality of the people is that they are usually reserved and sometimes snarky. In the south you got battlegrounds galore and the food is delicious barbecue and lots of gravy dishes. The southerners also have their classic southern hospitality. In the miss west you have the rust belt where most of the \textbf{old} industry barons' factories are as well as many great dairy and fish products. Ye also have the Midwest kindness. Then in the west you have all sorts of sights related to the land and gold rushes with huge amounts of national parks and forests. Here you'll also find the most Native reservations which are great to visit. There are many great beaches as well as mix of American and Latin food. This is where you'll find the entertainment industry and all the actors as well as the hipster and valley girl types. So in short America has a huger array of history and culture just like any other wonderful \textbf{nation}.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}African, Nation, Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - Black, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/426 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.704 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small KomodoDojo give me a break, America is more of an evil empire then Britain ever was. First off the Americans didn't do shit in the Second World War! The Americans entered too late when the Germans was already seriously weakened by the Russians, the Russians would have taken then Germans out it may have taken longer but even Hitler's admitted that they would fall against the Russians. America just swooped in at the last second trying to take credit for everything when they did \textbf{nothing}. Number two, the American government is way more corrupt then the British monarchy! In some states people get 2-3 times the amount of voting power then other people in other states, if that's equality then I'd eat my own foot.in America the persistent holds all the power, in Britain we have the House of Commons and the House of Lords that debate everything before anything could be set in stone. Don't give me " your country is corrupt" shit for your county is way more backwards then the rest of the world. Even if there is a disagreement in Britain between political powers like a draw between two parties to become prime minister then the queen can step in and sort it out, what if this happens in America? Everyone bitches and argues like a little dweeb trying to claim the presidency. What about wars? Did you ever study how Americans raped and sacked innocent citizens in the Vietnam war? Oh yes! Americans captured then raped and tortures innocent villagers because Americans thought they where "terrorists". What about the slave trade? Britain's official ruling out of all slavery was in 1833! America? They went to war with themselves in America went to war with themselves in 1861 because they wanted to keep other humans as slaves, Americans are so animalistic that they had to fight each other over slaves. What about gun laws? Americans have guns everywhere and often go into schools and do a mass shooting. In Britain? Guns are hard to get your hands on and America has ruffly 160 times as meany gun homicides then Britain. The Middle East? America's fault actually trying to implant fake borders and fake "diplomatic governments" to selfishly appease their own ideology of power. Seriously have you ever studied what started the wars in the Middle East? It was started by America trying to wave their dick around for oil, no one likes a micro penis being shoved in their face.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small To everyone commenting on the currency changes: 1) don't say it is stupid or pointless or whatever if you are not from the UK. The British are definitely not insulting the US for having a bunch of dead \textbf{old} men, or the Canadians for having plastic money, or the Zimbabweans for having so many 0's on their notes, so don't criticize a system that has no effect on you. Yes, you may find it \textbf{weird} and comment about it, but don't argue with other people about such a trivial thing (especially with people it will actually affect)2) To those asking why it will happen, I'd like to take you back to Imperial Rome. During this period, coins served as one of the tools used by the new emperor to both differentiate himself to the population from his predecessor, and to secure his (and not another's) rule, especially to the provinces further away from Rome. Since coins serve as the fastest way to propagate about your rule to your empire (since currency as we all know travels very fast), every emperor had themselves minted on new coins and had their predecessors removed from circulation as soon as possible. (this was obviously done with much more urgency in the cases where a new emperor had a terrible predecessor like Caligula, Nero, etc, and you wanted the population to not associate your rule with theirs)This process was picked up by monarchs throughout the European sphere, with each new monarch replacing the deceased, deposed or abdicated monarch on the currency. It may seem illogical and strange to us in this globalized society, but this has been going on since antiquity, and will continue with all forms of monarchies (yes, regarding this the Vatican counts as a very unique form of non-hierarchical monarchy) for as long as printed and minted money still gets used.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Old, Weird & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}2/311 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.643 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Doesn't it just mean to mint *new* currency with the new monarch? Especially for coins which show a date, I don't think this would be a problem: Just roll out the new batch and start taking the older currency out of circulation. This is normal and not an additional costs to commonwealth States who show the Queen on their money. For instance, New Zealand and Australia have various coins in circulation from different times and the Queen is shown at different ages: there are still coins that show a younger Queen Elizabeth on them. I think NZ updates her portrait every 15-20 years. NZ and Canada have recently launched new banknote designs anyway, these are to increase measures against new technologies in counterfeit money and this expense would have \textbf{nothing} to do with the Queen.The real cost, these former colonies would have to consider is whether it is worth becoming independent republics: replacing flags, currency and changing their system of government to avoid paying for the continued upkeep of the royal family and expensive events such as the funeral.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Krombopulos Michael You admit the british people like her and that being a republican is something not very \textbf{common}, yet you deny that she is a unifying force in the country. It's quite funny how you can think that a head of state who is overwhelmingly popular can somehow not be a unifying force, despite Brits, for generations, enjoying their monarchy. The monarchy represents the stability of Britain and it's democracy. Many other nations lost their monarchies due to coups, soviet invasion, or being annexed and their monarchy exiled. Very few willingly and popularly abolished their monarchies, and even less survived afterwords. It had almost always led to the rise of dictatorships. If it isn't Napoleon, then it's Franco, Stalin, Hitler, Mao, or, funnily enough, Cromwell. Brits have a reason to like their monarchy, and people have a reason to not like it. Both are acceptable and there is no reason to talk down on the people who do.
