  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Henry Mudgett I'm white and don't believe in tribalism. I think humans are idiots for do so. It's so primitive. Whites have done good and bad, but ultimately it doesn't matter,because the individual matters the most. I didn't do any of that shit you listed, so I feel no shame. However, I also didn't write Romeo and Juliet, go to the moon, think up the theory of relativity, etc, so I feel no pride. Why the hell would either of those things be attached to my skin tone, anyway? people are so annoying. They think if they have the same color they're the same. That's why people harass whites for crimes of their ancestors. Focus on the present. The past bleeds into the present, but you cannot punish the innocent for the crimes of the another. I am going to write a book, one day, and just yell at y'all about how you guys love tribalism and how it perpetuates \textbf{xenophobia} and bigotry. Every \textbf{race} has brutality and suffering in it and I'm sick to death of people trying to shame me just because people who looked like me were pieces of shit. I'm over it. I don't desire pride nor shame. It's a damn skin color. Its like being proud of all blondes. Meh.

And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written,18 The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the \textbf{blind}, to set at liberty them that are bruised,19 To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.20 And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him.21 And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.22 And all bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is not this Joseph's son?23 And he said unto them, Ye will surely say unto me this proverb, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in thy country.24 And he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is accepted in his own country.25 But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when great famine was throughout all the land;26 But unto none of them was Elias sent, save unto Sarepta, a city of Sidon, unto a \textbf{woman} that was a widow.27 And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, saving Naaman the Syrian.28 And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath,29 And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong.30 But he passing through the midst of them went his way,31 And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath days.Luke 4:16-31BTW I have white skin and declare that Jesus is Lord of lords and King of kings.Jesus said:43 Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.44 But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;45 That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.46 For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?47 And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?48 Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.Matthew 5:43-48Am I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truth?\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Blind, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}2/624 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.321 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small That's is funny.  :-))What you have too remember is a \textbf{race} is different from a ideology  religion these are IDEAS and all of them are flawed.So Communism, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Socialism etc are all IDEAS not a \textbf{RACE}. Alot of people don't understand the above statement which is why the term \textbf{racism} is used with anti Islam feeling in particular at present. The term Islamophobia is the wrong term as well because a PHOBIA is a medical term for an anxiety disorder which is fear of a situation which at times are irrational. Rejection of Islam is not irrational as it has not been a positive force over the last four hundred years, it has only caused misery and hate in recent history.

Any european looking at this man on stage can quickly identify him as j ewish by physical features alone.

"\textbf{Race}" doesn't exist from a biological standpoint. Humans are all so genetically similar and so intermixed that they have no subspecies, and no races. What we CALL ‚Äò\textbf{race}' is actually just a rough set of traits related to locality - and even then, very loosely. We're not even as different as different breeds of dogs (sometimes the term ‚Äò\textbf{race}' is applied to breeds - but even then, humans have no breeds, either).We're more like dogs of the same breed with different coat colors, like a blue merle versus gold border collie. Any difference among animals similar to what humans call ‚Äòraces' among themselves would be too insignificant to even mention in taxonomy. Yes there is significant genetic diversity but it hasn't reached a threshold for scientific classification. That is, there hasn't been any actual major 'isolation' event that has 'separated' the human chain or descendant for long enough to develop radically different 'sub-species'. It's below what taxonomists would call "subspecies" as for now. The day the genetic diversity is great enough to be of taxonomic significance is the day it moves from "social construct" to scientific classification.

It's a preference, that's fine.The social tension in Europe and USA is much more complicated than just races.You advocate for the nationalist group with valid concerns, but the wrong ideas and reasoning. That's why I said that you would be a great villain. This white hate is temporary. That type of thing happens. Not 70 years ago, we were all segregated by \textbf{race}. Give it time. Not wanting your white children harassed because they are white is silly. People will harass each other for the silliest reasons, some outside your control, like sexuality. They could also have unspeakable things done to them, outside of your control. Just saying this because you seem to have an unrealistic view of how things work in society. Another kicker: heritage. "Heritage" is \textbf{nothing}. Your father, your mother, \textbf{nothing} integral to who you want to be. You may choose to make them so, or just emotionally, but you are just trying to make yourself fit into something or believe it. You can be what you want to be, barring your personal limits, which you should know by self-reflection and self-discovery. Your ancestry, your skin color, your language - it doesn't mean anything. In the end, you're your own person, and you can attach yourself or not to a variety of things, and heritage is simply a frail option.

If you believe that this white hate is only temporary, you are quite gullible. Propaganda can be very, very powerful. We see I'm in the movie theater, news, and hell, even at the place I work I get questioned by Hispanics on who I voted for(which I didn't even vote for trump)and how I must be mixed because 'white people aren't as pretty as you'... it's not gonna just fly away.

While we are at it, everyone in our government needs to be thrown out and new people need to be thrown in or else this cycle will continue. Our whole government system is filled with fleas.

What if those related to you are multi-racial? Simply, your whole argument falls, because there isn't any depth to it. It's not about hating or loving any \textbf{race}. Yes, white hate is temporary. I'm white and I live in Puerto Rico, whites are the minority here. It's just the outrage culture that has you thinking that way. People are still violent towards blacks for their skin color, still violent towards gays, it's just how it is and how it's gonna be, and you're just falling for confirmation bias if you truly think that whites are targeted more than any other \textbf{race}. Yes, I know that propaganda can be very powerful and that it fools people like you, but I don't believe you to be fully gullible. Getting through all the shit to actually find information that isn't biased is extremely hard in this heavily-politicized era. "Some people were \textbf{racist} to me."Yes, this happens. People have been \textbf{racist} to me, too. The more German side of my family has been very \textbf{racist} towards some of my other family. My grandmother was denied a friend because he was \textbf{black}. It's just how stupidity and misinformation spreads. People will insult each other based on stupid, superficial things like \textbf{race} until we grow out of it. For a society that was not accepting of gays, trans, and even non-whites not that long ago, I'd say that we're progressing pretty fast and we're  gonna stick to that road, unless 200 nukes go off.Anyone who thinks that this \textbf{age} isn't the best for the most people in the world is factually incorrect. World poverty and world hunger have never been so low. If you just took the time to read different things and not just what the outrage culture media feeds you, you would see. \textbf{Race} is a social construct. Our differences in the end will most likely be minimal. Culture =  = \textbf{race}. Not all white people are the same, this goes back to \textbf{racism}. You're assuming that \textbf{race} divides our cultures, but it is not the case, culture is so many factors, even people who were relatively close to each other in terms of location and skin color, the Native Americans, had drastically different cultures and societies. Vikings were not like Germanic Christians of \textbf{old}, and both were white cultures. You're tired of American children being kidnapped to Mexico? What about Mexican kids being kidnapped in Mexico? Just, I don't see how you can believe what you believe. That type of shit happens, yes, but it isn't as simple as "oh they're to blame because of their skin color", and I find it suspicious that you bring up only \textbf{black}-on-white hate, but I'll drop it in good faith. Americans also kidnap and rape American kids. Americans kidnap and rape Mexican kids. World terrorism and overall violence is the lowest it has ever been. Thanks to information spreading and quality of life improving across the board, but you people refuse to see this and just listen to what the media tells you. I'm not telling you to ignore everything that you see that tells you that bad things are happening, but you definitely seem to be heavily influenced by part of the outrage culture in America, in particular the "white genocide" type of paranoia (notice that I said "type", it definitely isn't exactly that, but it's very similar).

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@kayla koechig "actually, I just care about my children actually looking like they are MY children."This tells me everything about you. So you're basically saying you won't be able to love your children just because they slightly deviate from your appearance? You seem like the \textbf{woman} who'd dump their baby if he doesnt meet your expectations in looks. Do you know how superficial and heartless that you are? "If YOU think that every \textbf{race} is beautiful in their own way, why would you want to mix all of us up? Where's the diversity in that?"Huh, what kind of idiotic logic is that? If every group of people is beautiful in their own way, then what's stopping you from being in relationship with them? So you are accepting of differences in people but not accepting enough to be in relationship with them? See, this is where your logic falls flat. If you're truly accepting of differences in people, you'd be capable of accepting of those differences in loving them too. So logically it follows that you believe your group of people are superior in terms of looks/culture, otherwise you'd be capable of seeing everyone as equals, but you don't. Do you know who believed the same? Hitler. That's right, people were discriminated based on eye, hair, skin color, culture and many other superficial traits which was one of the main reasons for the Holocaust. It's so obvious to see you're using the "preserving culture/diversity" argument to mask your true beliefs.Second, you don't have the faintest idea if you think culture/heritage is lost being in intercultural/interracial relationships. I'm from a family who has seen plenty of intercultural marriages and I can guarantee there's mutual respect and love for each other's culture. People who are open minded and truly love each other won't let any sort of differences get in their way to be with them. Anyone who uses "preserving culture" argument against those marriage tells me they're either lazy to put in the work/judgemental/xenophobic/ethnocentric deep down. There's only conflict in cultures only if you can't overlook/negotiate them. I even know hardcore atheists and theists doing well in relationships.Even assuming your culture gradually dies away and a new culture takes its place in the future generations, why should it even bother you? You aren't around to see this new culture anyway. This is how it has always been in the past, cultures evolve and new cultures are birthed. It's called "cultural heterogenization". Read your own European history on how your culture came into existence. So give me one logical reason why someone should give two shits about their heritage. How and why should it matter to you? How Is it in anyway benefitting you now by fearing for something that may or may not happen in future generations? "Have we learned anything from history?"Let me tell you what we have learned from history, if anything, Almost every war that started in the past are because of either nationalistic or religious reasons and even to this day we have conflicts between different nationalities and religious groups. This irrational nationalistic sentiment creates an "Us vs them" attitude which serves no purpose other than divide people.

I'll tell you what's natural, We all lived together before we all forced ourselves our way out of Africa. The side effect, however, was that we became so coddled and comfortable around people in our personal territory that anyone who shows up different than us would be met with aggression and signs of displeasure. As a progressive society, it's about time we become self aware of our own prejudice and force ourselves to live together so that we eventually override them.There's \textbf{nothing} natural in Racism/prejudice and many studies have validated this. We feel comfortable because that's the environment we grew up in."Following a series of studies, researchers have discovered that six- to nine-month-old infants demonstrated racial bias in favor of members of their own \textbf{race} and bias against those of other races.The findings are said to be a result of the overwhelming exposure infants have to their own \textbf{race}, and experts have warned it is wise to introduce children to people from a variety of races before the issues deepen."

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@kayla koechigSo many misinformation I don't even know where to start. I don't know where you learned biology, but there's no such thing as "breeds" in humans.Humans are all so genetically similar and so intermixed that they have no subspecies, no breeds and no races. What we CALL ‚Äò\textbf{race}' is actually just a rough set of traits related to locality - and even then, very loosely. We're not even as different as different breeds of dogs (sometimes the term ‚Äò\textbf{race}' is applied to breeds - but even then, humans have no breeds, either).We're more like dogs of the same breed with different coat colors, like a blue merle versus gold border collie. Any difference among animals similar to what humans call ‚Äòraces' among themselves would be too insignificant to even mention in taxonomy. Yes there is significant genetic diversity but it hasn't reached a threshold for scientific classification. That is, there hasn't been any actual major 'isolation' event that has 'separated' the human chain or descendant for long enough to develop radically different 'sub-species'. It's below what taxonomists would call "subspecies" as for now. "I have never NOT met an individual who is unbiased and somewhat kind of a saint. We just have to realize that we are no different from animals in some ways"Then you need to get outside from living in your little square box and meet more people.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Rasmus Vohlakari Nationalists like you claim not to be \textbf{racist} but fail to realise that caring strongly about preserving their \textbf{race} is a form of \textbf{racism}. Let's face it that's really the bare bones of \textbf{nationalism}, stopping interracial breeding and preserving the status quo. What they don't understand is that it doesn't matter what \textbf{race} or culture is the majority at any one point in time, only that they accept and love all the others, and that the new cultures that are born continue that ideology. Like confucianism and christianity were the principles on which Asian and White (respectivly) cultures were developed, the next era's cultures should be developed on a belief in acceptance and love. Let me give you crash course in how British European culture came into existence:The UK started with some hunter-gathers whose names are lost to history...then it appears Indo-Europeans came (various Celtic Tribes).  Then later other Indo-Europeans came and dominated and mixed with them (the Romans).  The Romans at that time were not a pure group, they had conquered very \textbf{ethnic} groups around them to Semetic people in the Levant, to Greeks, to Celtic tribes, to Germanic tribes, etc.  The original Romans were a mix of Italic people and people who did not speak an Indo-European language, thought to have migrated from ancient Anatolia, the Etruscans.So the Romans brought all this mix into the UK.When the Romans withdrew, they left some Romanized Britons behind, who later became the Welsh.England itself, Celtic got overran by several Germanic Tribes.  Those Tribes eventually mixed with the Celts (who were already mixed with the aboriginal hunter-gathers whose name is lost forever), and became the Anglo-Saxons.Then the Vikings, a Northern Germanic IndoEuropean tribe invaded the North of England and established the "Danelaw".The rest of England was Anglo-Saxon.When the Anglo-Saxons finally ran out the Danes who left a biological and cultural impact on Northeast England, the Normans invaded.  The Normans were a mix of Vikings who settled in Normandy (Northern France) and mixed with the French inhabitants.The French were a mix of Romans (who were not pure anything) and Celtic tribes that were conquered, also by that time the Franks (another Germanic tribe) had conquered the \textbf{nation}, from which France gets it name.So these "impure" Frenchmen conquered the "impure" Anglo-Saxons.Eventually all these folks overtime condensed into what we call the "English"Now do you think an Englishman looks in the mirror at night and cries he is not pure Saxon, Angle, some random Celtic tribe, Jute, Danish, Norwegian, aboriginal hunter-gathers, Italic, Etruscan, and the list goes on?NO.  To them they are simply English.  Don't even get me started on how many times the language or religion changed in England over the last 2,000 years.  English didn't even exist then, and there were no Christians, people did not even speak a language that would become English (Western Germanic language) until centuries later.And 2,000 years from now they might see themselves as something else...maybe just European, and be mixed with various migrants from all around Europe, Africa, Middle East, South Asian, etc.  Still they might call themselves English though, who knows.This type of thing has happened EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD.  There are no pure people.  So anyone who says they're \textbf{ethnic} or racial purity is possible, let alone desireable is a f'ing idiot.  Anyone who tells they are "pure" something is also a complete and total idiot.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnic, Nation, Nationalism, Race, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}8/577 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.386 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Just to clear up how most of these ancestry DNA tests actually work, is that when they say you have 14 sub Saharan \textbf{African} (for example) it means 14 of your genetic code is similar or the same to those people of sub Saharan \textbf{African} DNA. For this reason this type of DNA testing takes decades to get going as it requires millions of samples to get accurate ideas of genealogy. In humans basically every person will have at least a 1 or more which is \textbf{African} as that is where humans evolved. However, having 14 \textbf{African} DNA doesn't mean someone in the last century in Your family was \textbf{black}. No it means genetically your DNA has a 14 similarity to \textbf{African} DNA. I would like to point out that the video never said they used ancestry.com or some other website to do the testing.

Random fact, did you know that the median \textbf{age} of Japanese Americans is around 50 years \textbf{old} and the median \textbf{age} of Hispanic Americans is in the mid to low 20s? This seems irrelevant but my point is, there are infinite variables in this equation that absolutely effect behavioral patterns between different races and nationalities that have \textbf{nothing} to do with IQ whatsoever. Do you expect similar behavior from a 21 year \textbf{old} as you do from a 50 year \textbf{old}? I don't. If you want to get technical, how many \textbf{black} Jeffrey dahmers have you ever heard of? Or Ed Gein? Or Ted Bundy? I mean do white people have mass murdering cannibalistic necrophilia genes? I don't think we do, I mean I don't feel like a sick bastard üòÇ.. I'm pretty sure it's just natural, infinite fluctuations of circumstances. You know when slavery was abolished, it wasn't just \textbf{black} people moving towards northern cities it was also white southerners moving north. \textbf{Black} northerners (who already lived in the north, comfortably) did not get along with the \textbf{black} southerners because the cultures were so different, imagine that. Guess what else, white northerners did not like white southerners either. I would argue that the divide was actually about north and south and it became skewed to look like white and \textbf{black}. I imagine this magical experiment where all the babies from the roughest neighborhoods were swapped with all the babies from the most rich white upscale neighborhoods. All those babies would grow and learn and adapt to their environments. The culture in each neighborhood would remain the same regardless of the color of the people in those neighborhoods.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Black, Nothing, Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!27}13/369 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.523 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Humm, you're wrong if you think only skin pigmentation changes with \textbf{race}. Blacks have more testosterone and tend to be more athletic and get angry/violent more easily (might sound \textbf{racist} but it's a direct consequence of high testosterone levels, you can study about this yourself). White adapt more easily to the sea and have practiced fishing and other aquatic activies for thousands of years, they're better swimmers overall. Hair texture is also alot different, in this case because of the climate. Really, saying \textbf{race} is just about skin color is just as stupid as being \textbf{racist}. A non-\textbf{racist} person is not someone who says we're all equal, it's someone who, despite all differences, accepts them. I do accept them but I'm not going to lie and say we're all equal, because we're not. But then again, that is not a reason to hate anyone.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Race, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}4/144 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.778 \\  \hline

White people are more aquatic üòÇ. Who gives a shit, that's still fluctuating circumstances. Different parts of the world have different cultures and environments and all these different circumstances of course there's gonna be different strengths and weaknesses and social patterns. We're just one species that evolved in different climates. Physically there are some differences but they all have to do with growing and adapting to what's around us. And social patterns are the same thing too, learning and growing and adapting to what's around us, and the people around us. From climate and food to culture and history.. different people do different shit and have different interests and learn in different ways..The best part about being human is individuality. Even with patterns and assumed probabilities, 2 people of the same \textbf{race} can be completely different while a white and a \textbf{black} person can be cut from the same exact cloth, with the same family values and beliefs and culture.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/189 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.058 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Gersht Waffen fair enough but saying whites are not allowed to do it I find very hard to believe. Wether it's subtle or not white power is everywhere you look in favour of the white \textbf{race}.

Forcing everyone to look like them, talk like them, walk like them, think like them etc. And still do it.I think what your trying to say is that many people of colour resent white people preaching white power. Why? Because alot of these people are upset and angry as to what white people have done over the centuries and still do to other cultures just because of a racial difference. I'm not saying it's right but atleast understand what's taken place upto the present moment.. White people in the colonised system have everything yet it's still not enough... y'all never satisfied. And now you moan because of the consequences of what's been and being practiced? now it's being done to you lol. I find that quite ironic.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Reading that was very hard. You just compared total gene segment contrast from other primates, to the weighted geographical data which accounts for \textbf{ethnicity} in a small given number of generations. Seriously, it takes no more than 5 minutes of research to learn how this process works.The calculation is made by looking at small sectors in DNA samples (to which we're very familiar with). Then, an ever-growing data-set which in this case is filtered to account for geographical data, is passed through a simple comparison algorithm in which reliability is calculated as accurate for the number of data points involved. I don't think you know what "statistical noise" means. It refers to the variability in a sample, we're talking about a massive number here (14). Any variability is irrelevant.It means we have generations like this: [LINK] or this: [LINK] See how that makes a lot more sense now as to why you wouldn't qualify as a Native American? You're looking at how these percentages are determined completely wrong. Recessive and Dominant traits are calculated for, as well as their diminshment timelines for generations.Now that you've been educated, let's do a simple math problem on paper. Draw out ~50 splits in a single traced generational path for two different ethnicities we want to account for, let the number of generations reach 100.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Here's some education for you:'Evidence of an unknown species of human ancestor has been found hiding in the DNA of West \textbf{African} people. Experts made the finding by analysing the human genome, looking for strings of genetic information that were out of place. This revealed an inheritance of markers from an unidentified human-like species [‚Ä¶] Researchers believe an ancient species of hominin, known as Homo heidelbergensis, may be the most likely candidate for the 'ghost' species.' [LINK] 'People in West Africa carry mysterious genes that may belong to another species of hominin. The finding hints that primitive hominins lingered in Africa until fairly recently.' [LINK] "Reanalysis of the 13,000-year-\textbf{old} skull from a cave in West Africa reveals a skull more primitive-looking than its \textbf{age} suggests. The result suggests that the ancestors of early humans did not die out quickly in Africa, but instead lived alongside their descendents and bred with them until comparatively recently. The skull, found in the Iwo Eleru cave in Nigeria in 1965, does not look like a modern human."[The skull] has got a much more primitive appearance, even though it is only 13,000 years \textbf{old}," said Chris Stringer, from London's Natural History Museum, who was part of the team of researchers."This suggests that human evolution in Africa was more complex... the \textbf{transition} to modern humans was not a straight \textbf{transition} and then a cut off.' [‚Ä¶]"Separate research published earlier this month suggests that genetic mixing between hominin species happened in Africa up to 35,000 years ago.' [LINK] 'In the Sub-Saharan region, unaffected by Denisovan or Neanderthal interbreeding, H. sapiens interbred with H. heidelbergensis, because high humidity militated against fire-making and allowed the survival of these non-fire-making hominids.'Homo heidelbergensis mostly had smaller brains than Neanderthals, Denisovans, and H. sapiens. While no traces of H. sapiens interbreeding with Neanderthals or Denisovans have been detected in Sub-Saharan Africa, as noted, genetic studies show that H. sapiens did interbreed with H. heidelbergensis in this region [46]. Brain size differences have been noted among people of Sub-Saharan \textbf{African} descent, Australian Aboriginals, and people of European descent, the former two of which showed smaller brains [44]. The smaller brain sizes detected in aboriginal populations in the tropical regions of Africa and South Asia can be attributed to interbreeding with H. heidelbergensis [46]. These humans presumably benefited from interbreeding with hominin ancestors who depended less on fire and likely had cognitive aptitudes making them more adept at surviving in the tropics.'The significant differences in brain size observed between tropical and other regions were influenced by tropical conditions, which prove harsh for fire-making, a key technology for accessing the nutrition necessary to grow big brains. Instead, H. sapiens in tropical regions interbred with populations that depended less on fire for survival, leading to smaller brains in these areas.' [LINK] 'Tishkoff's team also found signs that the ancestors of the hunter-gatherers bred with different species of hominins, probably more than 40,000 years ago, she says, which supports earlier findings that humans living in Africa at times interbred with species of hominins that have gone extinct.' [LINK] 'Our results suggest that Yoruban individuals trace about 7.9 of their genomes to an as yet unidentified archaic population. This is in agreement with some results from previous papers in other \textbf{African} populations such as the Biaka and the Baka, suggesting that there was a rich diversity of hominin species within Africa and that introgression was commonplace. Using our inferred segments of archaic ancestry in the Yoruba, we find that there are regions of the genome that are under higher selective constraint have reduced archaic ancestry on average indicating that the archaic alleles were deleterious in the hybrid population.' [LINK] 'we conclude that a divergent MUC7 haplotype likely originated in an unknown \textbf{African} hominin population and introgressed into ancestors of modern Africans. [‚Ä¶] Our results show evidence for introgression from an unsampled archaic population to the genomes of present-day Africans, and as such, are concordant with recent studies describing such an introgression in Africa [‚Ä¶] our results contribute to the emerging notion that functional variation introgressed from an \textbf{African} hominin population into modern humans and has been maintained among contemporary \textbf{African} populations.'

Also, the most recent actual execution by hanging in the Unites States of America was carried out in 1996, which is not such a long time ago; and, according to the same article, the states of Washington and New Hampshire do retain hanging "as an option. In New Hampshire, if it is found to be 'impractical' to carry out the execution by lethal injection, then the condemned is hanged, and in Washington the condemned still has an outright choice between hanging and lethal injection."

Also, the hypocrite here is any Latino or \textbf{black} who celebrates Christianity being that the religion of Christianity was forced upon Native Americans and blacks thru slavery, rape and genocide. This is the reason why the fake white version of Jesus you see today was repainted over and over after originally being painted from Cesare Borgia, who was the son of Pope Alexander VI. They repainted him into a white looking version of the fake Christ so that when Native Americans and blacks were to be enslaved and forced to accept Christianity, they would then subconsciously see whites as being closer to God because of the portrait of the fake white Jesus.

Some arabs from Syria for example look very European, have light eyes and blond hair (they look more white than some Italians or Greeks), but if you move in the southern area you will see a lot of them looking like those living in the Peninsula . Also Sudanese (Horn of Africa) are considered arabs but their genetics are not much different than the sub saharans.Arabs are like Latinos in the US they are a mix of many ethnicities.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I was referring to Australian aborigines not the general Australian populace. Ovarall, Australia as a country has an IQ average in line with the rest of the western world.IQ, being a measure of general intelligence has very little to do with actual education. Countless studies show when identical twins are separated by birth and raised in communities of different economic strata, and of differing quality of education, their IQ's will be roughly the same by the time they reach adulthood. So IQ is essentially an innate biological quality, not something that's taught.Also you keep referring to culture as something completely separate as if it dodges the problem. Culture does not simply fall out of the sky. Asians have advanced cultures that have developed over thousands of years because they were the ones forming those cultures. A culture exactly like, say, Russian culture could not have formed in Africa, because the people who made it were Russians, not africans.Cultures are a direct reflection of the people, not the other way around. For example, in many Sub-saharan \textbf{African} countries, the native languages which are not written, have very little in the way of precision of specification. So in many nigerian dialects you cannot say that a "\textbf{fruit} is half way up a tree" you can only say it's "up the tree."

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Umar C but it does matter. Because white people are villainized. And \textbf{African} Americans will always carry that stigma. There is a certain reverse discrimination that exists, but is left untouched by the media because that would be "\textbf{racist}". In order to have a real conversation about this, we have to look at all sides of the situation. That's why we aren't getting anywhere and in fact, the racial divide escalates. Instead of looking at the facts, it's easier to blame white people for all of your problems. Look, I'm white, and I grew up in a middle-lower class household. My family could barely afford clothes to put on my back or food to feed me with. But I made something of myself. I never blamed anyone because my family was poor. And in fact, when you think about it, even the poorest Americans generally own a tv, refrigerator, even a computer. The quality of life of even the poorest Americans is unrivaled compared to other countries. I simply cannot understand how this argument "we were put in unfavorable circumstances (decades ago) and therefore, we can't expect to succeed". BULLSHIT. I was in awful circumstances too. Just because you are born white doesnt give you the world. Americans are all born with opportunity to succeed.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/215 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.93 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Vandaleyes    We are, at least statistically. As far as overt \textbf{racism} goes, the US has come a long way. However, a \textbf{black} man from your same neighborhood has less opportunity than a white man in your same neighborhood due to unintentional bias. Most sociologists agree there is still a lot of bias against minorities that hinder their success. Here is the same situation for someone who is \textbf{black} and someone who is white. W Manager: "Hey why are you late?"W Employee: "Oh, I had to care of some things at the home for the little ones"W Manager: "Oh, okay. Try not to be late next time."Okay, here it is for some who is \textbf{black}W Manager: "Hey why are you late?"B Employee: "Oh, I had to care of some things at the home for the little ones"W Manager: "Oh, okay. Try not to be late next time. No excuses."The same scenario and basically the same response, but the subtle difference displays where unintentional bias and implied association plays a role in that persons success.Another problem is when blacks underwent residential segregation, poor blacks became stuck in a cascade of poverty; good school systems produce success, the school system runs on local taxes, local taxes come from residents, and the residents have no money to begin with. There is less access to affordable goods and healthcare (not just the care itself but actual facilities), and, due to poor conditions, their health is not the best. The little money that someone just made last month has to go towards healthcare, and so on. And do even get me started on how residential segregation helps when politicians redistrict the votes by gerrymandering.I understand that things have gotten better, for all of us, but they can still get better. In other words, yes, everyone has opportunity in the US, but it's not all equal.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Racism & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}4/318 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.258 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Robert Griffis How do you suppose we fix this problem? More affirmative action? Hilariously, this is the antithesis of "equality".

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small VandaleyesWell, the best way is to fix the public education system. More affirmative action would only allow more minorities into public universities. So, to answer your question, no, that probably wouldn't help MUCH. My ideal system would be for taxes to be more evenly distributed across districts so that poorer areas, of \textbf{black}, white, asian, middle eastern, and all people, could receive a better education. This would allow for people of lower socioeconomic status to have a better chance of getting into universities, which would diversify the economy as different types professions come into the community. But, of course, people with money don't like their money not coming straight back to them, so they wouldn't go for that. That's why the Affordable Care Act is perceived as a threat. To us, your middle class citizen, it poses no threat.And no, \textbf{black} people don't perceive most white people as inherently \textbf{racist}. We just assume that many whites have biased opinions about blacks, such as "most \textbf{black} people perceive most white people as inherently \textbf{racist}." Because of this we are always on guard, and we say things that we don't really mean. Everyone does this. But I don't blame you for your opinion. People tend to gravitate towards what is the loudest, not necessarily what is true. Just add a little rhetoric, and voila, you have sheep. There are some blacks who feel that all whites are \textbf{racist}, and they are the loudest in the media. The media amplifies this, and opinions like yours becomes popular. If you were right, I would think you were \textbf{racist}. I just think that whites and blacks need to openly communicate about our relations without being so sensitive, then we would come to an understanding. That's what the most influential people in our government are afraid of.I feel that you care about how people relate to each other, otherwise you wouldn't have commented.

It followed restoration of white supremacy in the South and the passage of \textbf{Jim C\textbf{row}} racial segregation laws. In the 20th century, it was also associated with the rise of \textbf{eugenics} and ideas of racial purity. "There are hardcore \textbf{black} racists out there like the \textbf{black} Israelites who call white people the devil.

It is only a theory, that does not make it Law.When mixing, \textbf{black} is always the dominant gene. Therefore, whites should not exist. Anyway, \textbf{race} is a social construct, \textbf{race} can determined by phenotype, but from what I've read and studied; DNA cannot be used to determine \textbf{race}.

There is also plenty of evidence to support a Middle Eastern origin for all humans and a global flood.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small ScoffSlaphead72 Yes it does, I will simplify it for you. You said "That \textbf{woman} is a \textbf{black} supremacist", I have not heard that before, and therefore my reply was "That's a first". This means "that's the first time I've heard that". Another example could be going into the pound shop, then somebody says they bought something for ¬£1.50, I could say "That's a first". More help can be found on this forum on how to use this slang terminology:  [LINK]  I have used this many times in the past with similar reason and you are the first person to be confused, I believe you may have either traces of dyslexia or autism (no sarcasm involved - they struggle with things like this).\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/122 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.639 \\  \hline
