  \cellcolor{green!5}\small It's called sensory habituation, all of your senses have it, and it's an idea that has been around for some time. It's like how you don't feel your clothing on your body after a time, unless I remind you that you're wearing clothing. Or how white noise eventually fades into the background. Neurons get bored of sending messages and stop if \textbf{nothing} new or interesting happens. Your eyes would do this except that they take part in microsaccades, a slight unnoticeable movement of the eye, which keeps the neurons in the eyes constantly functioning. If you didn't have these and attempted to focus on an object, everything in the world not in motion would disappear.The interesting part is the study about people habituating more slowly if they thought it was toxic than if they thought it was natural. This adds to the current literature on sensory habituation.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}1/148 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.676 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Staring at something long enough DOES make you go \textbf{blind} actually. Sort of, anyway: if you can keep your vision very still, your ability to perceive patterns fades away as your brain just goes into auto-pilot and fills in the color. If the receptor cells in your eyes keep firing in exactly the same way, they'll eventually stop and let your brain take over to assume what's there. The problem with this is that your eyes make small movements very frequently, so this effect is almost never noticed.But, yeah, kind of a science fail there. I am disappoint.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Blind & \cellcolor{green!5}Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}1/99 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.01 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Actually you would go \textbf{blind} if you quit moving your eyes... kind of. Your eyes have to constantly be moving to continue to see things. If your eyes stopped their nearly undetectable shaking and the exact same areas continued to be stimulated by the same input the receptors would burn out and you wouldn't see anything. As soon as your eye moves a different set of receptors catch the input and you see it for just a fraction of a second. The first set have a moment to rest or refresh with new input. If the same input hits the same area continuously you stop seeing anything.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Blind & \cellcolor{green!5}Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}1/107 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.935 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I must be one of the strange humans. My sense of smell is so sensitive that when I'm in my house for long periods, I can detect a new smell right away while still smelling the house normally. When my \textbf{elder} mother sprays the air freshener in the bathroom, my nose goes into over drive of knowing how nasty the bathroom now is or was so to stay out of said area for ten minutes. I don't adapt to such scent because I've had to learn how to stay on the defense cause of the type of life I've had. I keep my instincts and senses going at all times.

The ad hominem fallacy is an easy choice for these people because, since they can't counter their argument, they try to invalidate it by making the opponent less credible (which it rarely ever does).Now, since I proved that the first chunk of your comment is irrelevant, the only thing left your comment says is "Laci is awesome". Fine, that kinda works, but it's still irrelevant because you provided no evidence or reason why she is or why you think she is awesome.Therefore, your entire comment can be deemed 'pointless'. It adds \textbf{nothing} to the conversation here (hell, it even insults a participant here), so it might as well not have been there in the first place hogging up space.Tl;dr: Your comment is pointless.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nothing, Sex & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/187 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.604 \\  \hline
