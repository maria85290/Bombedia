  \cellcolor{green!5}\small If Native protesters play their cards right , I can see this video being used successfully in the fight to change the Washington Redsk*ns name.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small After seeing the reverse hatred towards my team, our logo, and the city of Cleveland, I am going to state important facts and observations you may want to consider.  The prominent protester who's native american ADMITTED stealing \$77,000 in funds for Native Americans.  He was sentenced to 4 months in jail and 4 months house arrest.  Shouldn't these Native Americans, and the rest of these protesters be outside of this man's house protesting how wrong it is to steal from Native Americans and how wrong it is to not practice what you preach?!  Second, I counted 5 people that yelled profanity or mocked them, and showed not even 2 full minutes of fans entering the park.  The park's current capacity is 34,726.  How can you call an entire fan base all \textbf{racist} that doesn't show the other 34, 721 individuals from all backgrounds entering the park that don't act like that?  Besides the ballpark itself, the Indians have over 1 million fans on Facebook alone, and across the entire country; so to make a generalized statement that our entire fan base is \textbf{racist} based on a video clip that's not even 2 minutes long is an obvious false, and an inaccurate jump-to-conclusion analysis. I was out there for 2 games last August, so I can sit here and say I saw with my own eyes people from ALL walks of life who were wonderful, courteous, and would never do what is seen in the video above. FURTHERMORE, if sports teams are wrong for making money off of Native Americans, where are the current protests to change the Braves, \textbf{Black} Hawks, Chiefs,  and Redskins logos and names?  Yes, I'm confused too.  I happen to stand with the majority of fans including Native Americans that want to save the logo and are against the change, which is CONTINUOUSLY proven in multiple Cleveland and national polls to this day. In America, you have the right to your opinion, but you DON'T have the right to tell people how to think, feel, or what to believe.  With that in mind, I will close by saying 2 wrongs don't make a right, don't preach tolerance if you are going to be disrespectful yourself,  and don't be mean and attack your fellow man just because they hold a different view than your own.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/387 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.775 \\  \hline

Did blacks caused world war II, II - Korean, Vietnam and other wars? Nope. Are blacks the ones poisoning water and land with toxic waste, which causes fatal diseases? Nope. I can go on and on and on. Now compare all that to what blacks are doing to each other in certain cities. There is no comparison, really. Whites have done a lot more damage worldwide and throughout the centuries. So, please, stop trying to make blacks as the villains, while turning a \textbf{blind} eye at what whites have committed.
