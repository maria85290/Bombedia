He believed he was not \textbf{black} but brown with a South \textbf{African} mindset.

He's not slamming them either, just joking around and making a point about \textbf{racism}. White people are already proud enough, proud to the point that they think they rule with an iron fist over everyone else.

Yet Muslims think they are better than the rest of humanity based on their faith and how you call that?  they are never accused of it, yet they go around playing victim.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Race, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}8/109 & \cellcolor{green!27}7.339 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Samuel115sHe is \textbf{Indian} indeed and he is also \textbf{black}. He refers to himself as a \textbf{black} \textbf{Indian}. For the record, I am by no means \textbf{racist}. I believe we are all equal in the eyes of God and I believe in one \textbf{race} that descended from Adam and Eve. However, videos like this rub me wrong as blacks often gang up on innocent whites for absolutely no reason. I believe while yes there are \textbf{racist} whites out there, there are also many \textbf{racist} blacks. I never owned a slave. I would never ever own a slave or look down on another person because of the color of their skin yet I have encountered many situations in life where a \textbf{black} person has been extremely harsh to me because I am white. White have been pansies lately if I am honest and act too scared to stand up for themselves in fear of being called \textbf{racist}. But I prefer to enlighten others on a better way. God's way. I do not want a \textbf{black} to ever ever feel looked down upon by a white and vice versa. I do not think there should be rules that there has to be a certain amount of blacks in a movie in order for the producer to not get sued for \textbf{racism} when blacks have entire channels dedicated to their color such as BET. I want equality all the way around.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Brittany Renickâ€‹â€‹â€‹ originally there would have been no such thing as "\textbf{racist} blacks" here in the west. \textbf{Black} people started getting \textbf{racist} after all the \textbf{racism} and and rejection they faced from white people. \textbf{Black} \textbf{racism} is more anger, jealously, frustration, bitterness or retaliation as apposed to we're better than your kind and I don't like you cuz your different. \textbf{Racism} is bad no matter what however I have noticed that the motives for white \textbf{racism} vs \textbf{black} \textbf{racism} are very different. Here in the west, White \textbf{racism} usually comes from a place of ignorance or a one off bad experience. \textbf{black} \textbf{racism} cannot be based on ignorance cuz were encounter white people all day everyday so ignorance is impossible for us.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}13/122 & \cellcolor{green!27}10.656 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small All \textbf{racism} is ignorance no matter the reason. I feel that the majority of whites are not \textbf{racist} and that while there are some that are it's driven by the fact that blacks seem to hate us for that which we did not do but that our ancestors did. It's an endless cycle that needs to be broken and I do not believe videos like this one encourage equality. It fuels the hate of both parties.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/76 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.632 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Andy Chipling i think thats ignorant, just because you do not speak about it doesn't mean its not real. yes there are laws for rights. but they are laws. to but \textbf{racist} it j6st ignorant. judgment based on the color of skin is ignorant. meaning its ok to see color but not judge based on that. I am not saying kiss anyone's butt because they have a different skin tone.what i am saying people should stop assuming. if the world wants to change how some think, it's up to parents of all backgrounds to teach their kids, growing up i never once heard my parents make any sort of racial joke or speak badly useing \textbf{racist} words about any person. so its not about, not talking about it, its talking is worn out, now its about teaching kids the same i learned. teach them that regardless of color, everyone is human, until that human shows they are not trustworthy never pass judgment, and if or when any person shows they are not trustworthy, do not use that to label everyone. the \textbf{racist} issue in the USA is because of ignorance, on both sides, some humans are good, some are bad, That's what happens. but to not speak about it helps \textbf{nothing}, infact it hurts everyone like a butterfly effect. just like people useing violent protesting to get a point across.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nothing, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}4/230 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.739 \\  \hline

\textbf{\Large Result analysis:}

\begin{itemize}\item Taking into account the words that were detected, we can reach the conclusion these comments are associated with : : Ethnicity - General;Ethnicity - Black;Ethnicity - Native-American;Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments;Nationality - General;Age - Youngsters;Physical Identity - Physical Features;Gender - General;Age - Over 65s;%.

\item The percentage of hate speech related words is 3.3535.

\item Considering that the variable \textbf{Ethnicity - General} has the most occurences in the post, we can interpret that this is the predominant hate speech.

\item Overall there were 96/138 occurences of hate speech related comments.\end{itemize}\end{document}
