  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I've seen studies that say it probably is biological/instinctual. It's definitely not good, but as I've come to understand associating with similar "clines" is natural and is in fact rooted in tribalism. Humans with different features (no matter how insignificant they seem) feel more comfortable with people that look or act similarly. So there is an aspect of culturalism that plays heavily into it, but that's more conscious than sub-conscience. It's why someone who may by all account be \textbf{racist}, can still cheer for a different \textbf{ethnicity} if they represent their culture, for example sporting events or in times of war.So this is a great video about conscious \textbf{racism}, but there is sub-conscience \textbf{racism} which is much more difficult to fix. All we can do with that is to ensure our actions are not \textbf{racist}. And we have to understand that the sub-conscience \textbf{racism} can and does surface in different ways. For example, my neighbor's son was in daycare with all white students, elementary, all white students, but when he went to high school, there was more diversity and then I noticed that he didn't have any white friends. Over dinner, the subject came up and I asked him why, and he said "I just feel more comfortable with people of my own \textbf{race}." So even though environmentally, he'd only experienced "white" culture and it's all he was familiar with, he immediately gravitated to something else when the option presented itself. There's a lot of variables in this particular situation I'm sure, but that seems like an instinctual/biological influence more than a conscious decision.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity, Race, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}7/265 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.642 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Hi. I'm a molecular genetics lecturer at a tier-1 university on the west coast. "there is no biological basis for racial classification"This whole video is a load of propaganda trash. Her definition of species and what differentiates subspecies are completely uninformed. You could make an equally false argument by saying "HEY THE 16S rRNA IN MANY CELLS IS THE SAME, AND THEY USE 16S rRNA TO DELINEATE MICROORGANISMS, SO ALL BACTERIA ARE THE SAME SPECIES!"Species is CONVENTION, not empirical. That is what you mean by social construct, and you are correct, and then you contradict yourself by imposing the hard and fast reality of species in other systems. Just because it is convention doesn't imply it's meaningless.Species is a function of the scope and context of the system in which it is being used. Organismal biologists use macromorphology and phylogenetic reconstruction to determine where these conventions exist in animals. Molecular biologists use a whole different set of rules for determining useful classifications of species. So do virologists. Discovery, I expected much better from you. There are most certainly distinct genetic boundaries in human populations, not only ones that correspond to \textbf{ethnicity}, but even more. Why are you trying to make it seem like we are all the same? The differences between our populations is what makes us great as a system. To shrug these off as non-existent does all of us a great disservice.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/236 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.847 \\  \hline

It is social construct designed to ensure the progress of people separated by different degrees of castes. As humanity has progressed as a whole the extent and immorality of \textbf{racism} has become quite profound. It is clear for example that the white people of the United States enjoy a benefit from being white. They can say they are not \textbf{racist} but they stole this land from Hispanics and people they called savages. They dub people \textbf{black} brown and \textbf{y\textbf{e\textbf{llow}}}. No one is \textbf{black} but the Latin root for \textbf{black} is nigr. They will not be returning the land soon. \textbf{Racism} can only be forgotten by the enlightenment of humanity.

And I've gotten those comments from only \textbf{black} people and I've been bullied by other \textbf{black} kids for 'acting white' (whatever the hell that means).So things like that have made me hate being \textbf{black} and has made me want to distance myself from the \textbf{black} community.

The problem inherent in all these \textbf{racism} discussions is our western libertarian egalitarian ideals we all aspire to and demand everyone within the boundary set by our immediate horizon MUST AGREE WITH and MUST CONFORM TO without exception upon penalty of societal excommunication.  Take for example Australia's aboriginal population, who, in a short documentary screened on TV today postulated that yes, after the First Fleet arrived in Sydney (Port Jackson) there was no smallpox. But it broke out after a year and perhaps up to 90 of the local aboriginal population died. And who knows? "IT COULD HAVE BEEN DELIBERATELY  SPREAD" says the documentary. Then it concludes that even after more than 200 years there has not been a reconciliation......But what if there can never be a reconciliation? What if reconciliation MORPHS generation after generation and the differences grow faster that the reconciliation? What if any side of the divide can never accept? Then there are 2 simple answers. 1. European Australians are perpetually condemned and blamed - until they die out or leave the continent. Or. 2. Everyone agrees that reconciliation is impossible because it is. And everyone accept that today is a new dawn. I mean what if Captain Cook didn't DISCOVER  Australia? How long would it have been before smallpox arrived? After science invented a vaccine?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Hello. The bible(God's word) makes it clear that ALL humans are descendant from Adam and Eve. This means there is only one \textbf{race} of humans(Acts 17:26).  ALL people are created equal. This means there are not "higher" or "lower" races of people. We all belong to one \textbf{race}. God has placed a lot of variation within the human \textbf{race}. For instance, humans from the arctic look different than people from Africa.  Sadly, the bible also says that the ENTIRE human \textbf{race} is under the power of sin(Romans 3:23). The penalty for sin is Hell(Revelation 21:8). Thankfully the bible ALSO says that God is rich in mercy and grace. That is why He sent Jesus to die on a cross and take the punishment that we deserved. We broke God's law but Jesus paid our fine. Then Jesus rose from the dead, 3 days later, thus defeating death.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}4/147 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.721 \\  \hline

If species is a biologically valid taxon, then so too is \textbf{race}; it just depends on how one defines such.And sub-Saharan Africans don't constitute a \textbf{race}; they are paraphyletic, with some being more closely related to Eurasians than to other sub-Saharan Africans. For example, a Maasai from Kenya has more in \textbf{common}, genetically, with a Japanese person than with an Igbo from Nigeria.Extant humans are a hybrid species, descended from multiple species of hominins such a Neanderthals, Denisovans, and Archaic Africans, among others.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small ​\@OtherWorlds AllWorlds For the concept of \textbf{race} to be valid, humans would actually have to form monophyletic branches that could be clearly distinguished from one other due to a pretty uniform genetic isolation sustained over a very long period of time. This has actually never happened in humans, because due to migration (especially during the Neolithic Revolution), modern humans have retained an underlying sense of kinship and stayed mostly homogenous unlike with other cousins Neanderthals and Denisovans (which could most accurately be described as separate "races" due to being completely isolated from us for more than 500,000 years.) Eurasians have only been "isolated" from Africans for only a 1/10 of that time and have really never been truly isolated. The intermixing between Neanderthals and modern humans (and also Denisovans in some cases) and the Out-of-Africa migration would probably represent the most biologically significant divisions amongst humans, but even still like you stated, Sub-Saharan Africans never homogenized to a form a distinct group like Eurasians; Eurasians represent on subset of \textbf{African} genetic variation.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small ​\@LaMar McNeil Not true. Many species themselves are not monophyletic, so there's no argument that groups within a species must be so; and yet, there ARE largely monophyletic groups of humans, otherwise known as genetic clusters.There are over a dozen species concepts, and not all of them require monophyly, even if it is a good general rule of thumb. Hybrid speciation is far more \textbf{common} than previously thought. ANd no, most anthropologists do not consider Neanderthals and other archaic hominins to be the same species as humans. Just like dogs and coyotes are not the same species, in spite of their ability to produce fertile offspring. Species complexes refute your claim.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small ​\@LaMar McNeil Also, many scientists support the biological validity of \textbf{race}, even if they are afraid to acknowledge such; or rather, that \textbf{race} CAN be made biologically valid, just as species can be, even if there are no clear cuts boundaries between races, just as there are none between species; both are socially constructed for the purposes of our convenience in diving up life.Some such scientists include Richard Dawkins, Steven Pinker, Charles Murray, James, Watson, and many others.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@OtherWorlds AllWorlds Sure it can be made "biologically valid" but the validity is a very little importance in the context of society (considering that most peoples conceptions about \textbf{race} do not fix neatly with concepts of "Caucasian", "Australoid", "East Eurasians, etc., which are the most biologically significant taxons one could make, but rather than "\textbf{Black}, White, Brown, \textbf{Y\textbf{e\textbf{llow}}}" and a host of other categories that rely in physical characteristics) and science, considering that as Richard Dawkins contends, "It is genuinely true that, if you measure the total variation in the human species and then partition it into a between-\textbf{race} component and a within-\textbf{race} component, the between-\textbf{race} component is a very small fraction of the total. Most of the variation among humans can be found within races as well as between them. Only a small admixture of extra variation distinguishes races from each other." Dawkins is certainly not arguing what several other "\textbf{race} realists" are arguing, which is that there are intellectual differences between races that are biological in origin. However, geographic ancestry, which can correlate to \textbf{race}, obviously has some significance considering predisposition to certain diseases and such (sickle cell, skin cancer, lactose intolerance, etc.). But considering Africa has the greatest genetic diversity of any region, the category \textbf{Black} or even "Sub-Saharan" has very little biological relevance. In the future when most humans are mixed ancestrally, geographic origin will probably be of importance in the context of medicine, but that doesn't mean people will make concrete "racial" distinctions. There is a difference. There is a difference between saying two groups are genetically distinguishable and saying they are different "races."

Humans are very efficient at grouping things together as a means to simplify the problem and it works very well most of the time.  The biggest barrier between humans is a combination of many things with \textbf{race} only playing a very small role.  Language and cultural differences have proven to divide humans the most.  As for \textbf{racism}, this is more often fueled by an illusion of \textbf{racism} than the actual act itself.  When the media and politicians suggest that stronger boarders is motivated by hatred towards a \textbf{race}, when the media focuses only on officer involved shootings where a \textbf{black} people are killed, when politicians suggest that a political party is fueled by \textbf{racism}.

Have whites improved upon already existing technology? Absolutely. Have Europeans ever actually invented anything without non-white interference? The answer is a huge, resounding, no.

You've got to be welded to a collective to refuse to see otherwise. That's sad, and to cut on a dude trying to tell the welded collectives that their oppression will continue so long as they see themselves as victims of of ANYONE OR ANY GROUP, makes you a fool among fools. And as a white skin man how could I possibly know this? As a little boy I was raped incessantly. I have lived with PTSD, bi-polar I \& II, and ADHD, and schizoaffective disorder. I stayed a victim for years. I became a self destructive heroin addict. I never stopped working at an honest job to support my habit. There was a 2 YEAR WAITING LIST FOR METHADONE, AND SUBOXONE (Buprenorphine) was experimental. You got a 1 in 5 lottery chance to receive it. I didn't win.I OD'ed twice. I had been raising my son by myself. I couldn't die! So I began the arduous journey to recovery. I abstained for a whole year, but when I quit smoking I became schizophrenic, lost my son, relapsed and was homeless, spanging for my habit. I called the methadone clinic from payphones often to see when my name was called. Btw, in case you are wondering, the nicotine, a narcotic, in cigarettes is small compared to heroin, but was evidently just enough to keep me from entering a hyomanic, psychotic state...the rest is a blur. Finally the methadone clinic called. It wasn't until being on methadone for two years that my son and I were finally reunited. Fortunately, before all of this, I was a stable man and an interactive loving father for my sons first 4 1/2 years, the same \textbf{age} I was raped from my earliest recall.  My son was a well adjusted happy kid, but his time from me, his primary and strongest bond was broken, he developed BPD, Borderline Personality Disorder. BPD is the \textbf{mental} illness with one of, if not the highest suicide rates. At the \textbf{age} of 21, 10mo,14 days my beautiful son, my only child, committed suicide.  I try to live everyday as he lived. He seemed so together after he beat his own struggle with DXM ( drug put in Cough Syrup), but then he quickly succumbed to alcoholism in his first year of true adulthood where he could make his own choice to buy and consume \textbf{alcohol}. His Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) was diagnosed at 17-18 yrs, as was Bi-Polar ( as it ran both sides of the family) but psychiatric professionals so often refuse to treat BPM because they claim the therapy does not work..." The client relapses as a result of losing their newly found trusted friend, their therapist." I KNEW that the medication used to treat BPM wasn't enough because ultimately it never is. As I learned myself, therapy and medication work together for \textbf{mental} disorder recovery/regulation (I am a strong advocate for \textbf{Sexual} Abuse Therapy) With BPD it's a catch 22. I hope you understand what I am telling you. My message, Jesse Lee Peterson's message are the same. PEOPLE DIE EVEN AFTER WE FORGIVE AND ARE FORGIVEN. EVEN OUR OWN CHILDREN! BUT WE MUST FORGIVE THOSE WHO HAVE WRONGED US. WE MUST FORGIVE OURSELVES, OR THE CYCLE OF PERSONAL HATRED, THE ONLY KIND OF HATRED, OR THE CYCLE WILL NEVER EVER END!

Physical Environment, Culture and Religion are Breeding Programs which select those individuals with DNA BEST able to meet the survival standards.  Example You live in the Desert,  and your body good at salt retention? Your survival odds are better than those around you missing this Salt retention genetics. Your culture offered higher survival odds to those that are willing and able to follow the cultural dictates. Those unable and or unwilling to follow cultural or religious dictates, such as the murder of individuals who belong to various zealous religion groups; both historical and contemporary... who have been burnt at the stake, thrown off high places, get their hands cut off, hung... etc, for disobedience or apostasy. DNA test works to show what Breeds of dog your dog is comprised of.  Breed = \textbf{Race}.Mutts are Unpredictable NON-Specialists; Jack of All Trades...Master of NONE.They are adapted to NO ONE Climate, feeding strategy or instinctual behaviour and therefore are Maladapted to all harsh conditions and survival demands. Homo Sapiens are not even comprised of the same Species.  Many Europeans have Neanderthal DNA.  Asian may have some Neanderthal DNA but also have Denisovans DNA.

A species is either recognized as having no subspecies at all or at least two, including any that are extinct. The term is abbreviated "subsp." or "ssp."; plural: "subspecies".don't see boundaries anywhere in this definitionPercent variation is a disingenuous argument.  fish A and fish B have 1 percent variation. fish B and fish C have 5 percent variation.  fish C is deep water dwelling, fish B is tidal dwelling and Fish A is up on land air breathing.   genetics is not math.there is something drastically wrong with your statement about diversity between europeans, africans and founder effect, so wrong that a three year \textbf{old} could figure it out, but apparently not the anti white racists.morphological differences due to adaptations to the environment  are clines but not a branch of the evolutionary tree?  according to todd disotell biological anthropologist, yes an anthropologist not biologist at NYU.. and also a candidate for citizenship of a country that requires a DNA test for citizenship . what if the morphological differences where in brain volume? or degree of paranoia through changes in the limbic system morphology?  which affected behavior?  what is the end result? clines or evolution?

I've pretty much been surrounded by white people my entire life, mostly white neighborhoods, mostly white schools, and mostly white jobs.

I've also never witnessed a group of white people surround individual \textbf{black} people and beat them for no reason. Have seen enough groups of blacks do it to whites however.But personal anecdotes aren't very scientific, so lets conduct a little study. Search YT for groups of blacks beating up random white people and then groups of whites beating up random \textbf{black} people and lets see which example we can find more videos of.

My advice is to actually interact with \textbf{black} people before passing judgement with your exaggerated stories. I have never been jumped by a group of white people, but I have been harrassed and attacked because I was \textbf{black}. But many other \textbf{black} people have been jumped by groups and mobs of whites, and those scenarios well outnumber \textbf{black} on white attacks. If you want to claim that one group is more violent than the other, then its not even close. A couple thugs beating up some guy vs a collective genocide on a global scale doesnt even compare. White people started WW1 just for fun to see who was stronger and killed off like 40 million people.

Nowadays, it is a fact however that it is more likely for a \textbf{black} person to kill a white person than a white person to kill a \textbf{black} person.We are racists, yes. The definition of "\textbf{racist}" is a person that beliefs that not all races are created equal; that there are, by nature, certain groups of people who are superior to others, on an average scale. I judge people on an individual level, I just realize that statistical averages with history to support any presumptions about that person that I might have. I have never said, and never will say, that "all \textbf{black} people are stupid" or that "all \textbf{black} people are violent," because of course this isn't true. There are distributions along bell curves. I am only talking about the averages compared to other groups of people, for example, blacks vs Whites. I, personally, cannot recall any event where a \textbf{black} person was jumped by a group of white people simply for being \textbf{black}.When claiming that one group (the \textbf{black} \textbf{race}) is more violent than another, we look at statistics. Offically-collected FBI statistics support us. White people did not start WW1. I would go into how Jews control the world and how we fight these wars for their profit, but that's an entirely different subject which I won't go into.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Lies, Propaganda, misinformation \& Pseudo-Science! the video is wrong on so many levels. Debunked:Neanderthal \& Denisovan hominids:it is well known in the , anthropological, archaeological, and Genetic scientific community that Eurasians (Europeans + Asians) have inherited some Neanderthal \& Denisovan DNA. These were the groups of people that migrated out of Africa. Neanderthals were a group of archaic hominid that lived in Europe starting at least 300,000 to 600,000 years ago and went extinct about 30,000 years ago.\textbf{Racism}:\textbf{Racism} based on genetic differences, skin color \& phenotype has existed in Society due to a particular group of people (Aryans/Caucasian/Albino) creating caste systems based on skin complexion, mainly due to genetic insecurities \& a way to feel good about their genetic defect,  thus an effort to 'survive' and prevent the absorption and or annihilation of this particular minority recessive gene pool.\textbf{Racism} in American society is a 'Social' construct system created by Eugenic white supremacy groups/organizations.The concept of \textbf{race} is rooted in "Melanin" and the lack thereof. The Eugenic caste system created in America is a system based on whites vs non-whites, Lookup the Racial Integrity Act of 1924 passed in Virginia. (the law was pushed into congress by white supremacist Walter Ashby Plecker). Skin Color is NOT a characteristic associated with adaptation to climate and Environment!Melanin \& Albinism:Again, The concept of \textbf{race} is rooted in "Melanin" and the lack thereof. why do you think white supremacists refer to melanated people as 'People of color'? because people of color have 'Melanin'. Melanin is the pigment that gives color to the Skin, Hair \& Eyes. Functionally, melanin (Produced in Melanocytes) serves as protection against UV radiation. Melanocytes also have a role in the immune system. Caucasians are the most vulnerable to Sun Burn (UV exposure) \& Skin cancer due to a lack of melanin (Oculocutaneous Albinism).Moreover, Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is a group of rare inherited disorders characterized by a reduction or complete lack of melanin 'pigment' in the skin, hair and eyes. These conditions are caused by mutations in specific genes that are necessary for the production of melanin pigment in specialized cells called melanocytes. Albinism may be caused by a number of other genes as well, like OCA2, SLC45A2, TYRP1, and HPS1 to name some. In all, already 7 types of Oculocutaneous Albinism (OCA) have been recognized.Each gene is related to different protein having a role in 'Pigment' production (Melanin).Symptoms of Oculocutaneous Albinism (OCA 2) - the most \textbf{common} type of Albinism:The most \textbf{common} type of albinism, is caused by mutation of the 'P gene'.People with OCA2 usually have 'Pale skin' but often not as 'pale' as OCA1, and pale 'blonde' to golden, strawberry 'blonde', or even 'brown hair', and most commonly 'Blue eyes'. Furthermore, Caucasians are from Central Asia, descendants of the Dravidian \textbf{Indian} Albinos. Y-DNA Haplogroup R. R1b in Western Europe, and R1a in Eastern Europe.Genetic Diversity:Africa is the most Genetically Diverse place on Planet Earth!!. The Least Genetically diverse people are Caucasians, logically because of  "Recessive" Genetics (Inbreeding).Consistent with this result, all of the genetic data shows the greatest number of polymorphisms in Africa - there is simply far more variation in that continent than anywhere else. You are more likely to sample extremely divergent genetic lineages within a single \textbf{African} village than you are in whole of the rest of the world.(The Journey of man: A Genetic Odyssey, pg 39,(2002) Spencer Wells, Princeton University Press, USA)\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African, Common, Indian, Race, Racism & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Ethnicity - Native-American, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}8/581 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.377 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small You say "That there is no biological basis for \textbf{race}?" I concede that overall genetic variation in humans is low but I do not concede that \textbf{race} does not exist. If \textbf{race} did not exist then, for one thing, the races wouldn't look so different from each other. Let's not get hung up on the looks part too much but we'll use it as a starting point.Skin color is an obvious jump off point. Skin color, like everything else, is determined by one's DNA. So are other traits like facial features, height, and even health. So you CAN find real biological evidence for differences in \textbf{race}. Let's run with the health topic. Medical evidence abounds in this area, and no, this evidence is not limited to the diseases correlated with low economic strata or even correlated with location. Here are some purely CONGENITAL examples. Sickle cell anemia is associated with particular Sub-Haran \textbf{African} groups. White people are very susceptible to skin conditions like Acrodermatitis Chronica Atrophicans. Then there's Huntington's-Disease, which is another largely white person problem. Hispanics get Barret's Esophagus more than other populations and that one can, unfortunately, lead to deadly cancers. Also, a condition called Endometriosis, which causes uterine tissues to grow on \textbf{weird} parts of the body and makes a \textbf{woman} infertile is most commonly found in people of Eastern Asian descent. These congenital diseases, by definition, are caused by genetic mutations that are relatively unique to a \textbf{race}.Now, let's look at a more beneficial mutation; lactose tolerance. Only 35 of the world's population can drink milk in its adulthood. The ability to drink it is unique to a region of the world that includes Europe. Northern Europeans are the most lactose tolerant \textbf{race} on earth but, to be fair, milk drinkers also include, Middle Easterners, subcontinental Indians and East Africans, especially Ethiopians. All of these very different peoples had domestic cattle. Europeans were way crazier about their milk though. There were environmental reasons for that. Northern Europe is cold. It has short growing seasons and is prone to famine. So if you could drink milk as an adult you were more likely to survive and have kids who could also drink milk and then they went on to have their own kids and so on and so on. But you see? The ability to drink milk as an adult made Northern Europeans inherently different from say, Eastern Asians, who are 90-100 lactose intolerant. That's a stark difference from English and German populations with a mere 15. My final point comes from those popular ancestry DNA tests people are taking. You can swab the inside of your cheek, send in the sample and then learn that you have some Serbian DNA or Moroccan DNA, or whatever. Now, ancestry tests work because back in the day, our ancient relatives lived in groups that were geographically isolated from other ancients peoples ( not completely isolated mind you, but wat more than today). These isolated places changed them.  Different environmental pressures promoted different genetic traits through natural selection and thus, today, people native to one part of the world, are genuinely and inherently different from people native to another part of the world. Native Americans are not the same as Austrailian Aboriginals, who in turn are wildly different from the Jomon people of Japan, who in turn are very different from the Polynesians who in turn are very distinct from the northern Inuit tribes. Each \textbf{race} is uniquely, physically adapted to its environment. Therefore the genetic variation in ethnicities is enough to make biological distinctions between races. This leads to the inescapable conclusion that \textbf{race} is biologically real.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}African, Race, Weird, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}11/610 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.803 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small A few things wrong here,1. The benefit of genetic diversity only works within limits, out breeding depression is possible depending on how great the genetic distance is and how different the environments the genes evolved were.2. Hitler's "perfect \textbf{race}" would not be as prone to inbreeding depression as you may think due to the large numbers of Germans he had at his disposal. Having a large population size of one subspecies/\textbf{race} is clearly better than having a small but diverse group due to the reason stated above and the small number of people in the said population.3. yes there are bounds to what \textbf{race} someone fits into even if some admixture or some groups may be closer related. I like to use the analogy of how many liters before a pond becomes a lake the boundaries may be murky but they clearly exist and to ignore them may do more harm then good.4. despite the differences in the genes being small compared to other species like you pointed out. Considering that a 0.3-0.7 difference is enough to not only make us permanently genetically incompatible, but make us different genus' on the taxonomic level, imagine what a distance 0.1 is like. It's disingenuous to downplay a seemingly small but significant difference of genes in between groups.5.  \textbf{Racism} is clearly not a learned behavior but a built in response to how humans interact with other groups as a need to differentiate who is on their side and who is not, this is seen throughout the world today as countries with high \textbf{ethnic} diversity have a hard time staying together and the decreased opinions of other races the more interaction they have with other races.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small So... here is a little \textbf{mental} exercise for you...  You are lost in the deep dark woods in the Freezing cold of a winter forest...Your life depended on which breed of dog was brought in to search for and rescue your sorry ass... is your money on a PURE bred Pug, Boarder Collie, Saint Bernard or a Grey Hound?  How about an unknown parentage large mutt?  Hmmm?!Breed is synonymous with \textbf{Race}.YES, different breeds of dog can be crossed to get hybrid/mixed breed dogs Mongrels. However PURE breeds reliably exhibited both physical and behaviour traits, for which the breed is bred and known for.  A mongrel is an UNPREDICTABLE mishmash of the physical and behaviour traits of its parentage and is therefore UNABLE to reliably serve or survive in anything but the most temperate environmental and other situational conditions unassisted.  The pug would be too small and weak and cold sensitive, the greyhound ALSO additionally be too distracted by its prey chasing drive, its sense of sight far better than its senses of smell or hearing... Typical Border Collie has the energy, and Intelligence BUT it's herding instinct, and less than ideal body are disadvantages. The St. Bernard is the Ideal breed for winter search and rescue... a mix breed dog of say Border Collie and  St. Bernard... an Unpredictable mishmash of its parental traits. Neither physically nor behaviourally as suited for the Winter search and rescue job. The body may look mostly St. Bernard, but may have inherited the herding instinct of the Collie, it's sense of smell not predictably as keen as the Saint B. May be otherwise prone to other conflicting instincts, to say \textbf{nothing} of if this mongrel is comprised of 3 or more other breeds, also with incompatible instinctive and or physical traits inherited from its many deferent breed ancestors.One episode of Either 'The Dog Whisper' or 'In the Dog House' illustrates this.  The family owned a medium large white dog with a curled tail.  All of behaviour issues were not that difficult correct, except for the one persistent and most potentially dangerous even lethal behaviour trait. It would aggressively stalk and chase the youngest son who was about 8-10 years \textbf{old}. This was not the way a Collie intently stalks, chases and herds sheep, in a none threatening way. This dog stalked and chased the boy like a lion stalks and chases a gazelle...it's eyes when he looked at the boy were that of a predator stalking its next meal.  The Dog Trainer, having helped the family overcome the other unsuitable behaviours, puzzled over this most critical issue. He finally suggested a DNA test... the Dog Trainer had never encounter this before...sensed that there was maybe something to be discovered in the dogs DNA...out of the several BREEDS of dog the DNA test showed he was a mix of... ONE was a dog bred with an Extremely HIGH PREY DRIVE HUNTING Instinct, bred and used to go after game... about the size of an average 8-10 boy.  The rest were breeds rarely if ever known to stalk, chase and or aggressively activity hunt children or other similarly sized animals. Humans are no different than dogs, horses, cats, chickens... each divided into different Breeds which are born and exhibit predictively,  breed stable traits for which they are evolved and or deliberately bred. A Mongrel is an unpredictable, Jack of All Trades , Master of None. A generalist. Ill adapted to anything but the most unchallenging environments and most low qualifications jobs. An individual who will require outside assistance to survive under environmental conditions it's Pure Breed Ancestors would thrive in unaided.In Star Trek Lore, if you want an aggressive warrior, would you choose a Ferengi or a Klingon?Spock, Lieutenant Commander Worf' s son Alexander,  B'Elanna Torres and others, all characterize the difficulties encountered by mixed \textbf{race} beings.

Ok, but what about all those northern africans, middle easterns and indians of caucasian phenotype that look so similar to italians, spaniards and greeks?Take for example the italians and irish arrived in early XX century's America. They where considered biologically inferior and sometimes not even white (italians where even called "guineas"). Nowadays calling an italian "non-white" would be considered a nonsense, but that was not the case 100 years ago.In conclusion, people are free to marry whoever they want.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The problem is EVERYONE acts and thinks that everyone of a \textbf{race} or group thinks and acts the same. Each person has his or her own individual ideas/beliefs/characteristics! It is moronic to automatically suggest that someone who is "white", for example, has a specific attitude or belief about any range of topics. Believing that all white people have a deep down hate towards anyone or they are wicked is no less ignorant  that a white person believing that so called \textbf{black} people are violent or thieves by nature because of their skin color. Everyone is an individual with individual thoughts, ideas and characteristics. Here is an example, if the statistics (yes they are controlled and deceitful per the "controllers" agenda) show the majority of prisons contain a largely "\textbf{black}" population, that DOES NOT prove that individual "blacks" do or will act a certain way! This is also true about the so called "whites", groups living situation have a large part to do with a groups thoughts and actions including beliefs of superiority towards other groups....this is also part of a large plan by the "controllers"! Studies have proven that an infant of each \textbf{race} placed together, with no preconceived notions from group think programming, see each other as no threat and cannot even see a difference between each other based on skin color. Each group is being played against one another as part of the elites agenda of divide and conquer which has taking place since the beginning. If this was not true then WHY are the other "races" identified based on their geographic location BUT the so called whites and blacks identified by our so called skin color? Look at \textbf{old} work applications, when it asked for \textbf{race} what were the choices? Asian, hispanic, WHITE and \textbf{BLACK}. This has only changed recently because they are aware that slowly we are finally becoming wise to their agenda. I am "white" and I think disliking someone based on the color of their "flesh suit" is the TRUE SIGN of a low I.Q. ! That is a external sign of a carnal minded individual, we are all spirit being in a temporary human experience. If I had a disease, this is an example ONLY racists, which caused my white skin to turn \textbf{black} or vise versa I would still be the same individual on the inside. I understand we all have different DNA but again we are all spirit beings in a temporary human body of flesh. Liking the "flesh suit" you are temporarily in is ok but when it causes you to look at another spirit being in a lesser way than you become less of a spiritual being and more of a fleshly being. This is not new \textbf{age} thinking, this is the truth! If you cannot accept this than you lack of truth and understanding is externalized! We must learn to see each others \textbf{common} traits rather than the differences. No matter our color or \textbf{race} mankind has a genetic tribal predisposition to be happy, free and raise our family in a safe clean environment. What is and has been taking place has NOT been by accident, there has always been a "hidden hand" (freemasons) guiding us through executed and planned covert operations. To the masses these historical events caused societal changes and were \textbf{nothing} more than random happenings. The truth is the controllers COVERTLY caused these "events" through the Hegelian dialectic means to steer us on a certain path. To the average Joe this sounds absurd but that is only because you do not think that way. Everyone calls this conspiracy but first you must understand what the term conspiracy actually means! Conspiracy: a secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful. Was not each event which took place in history an exact definition of conspiracy? EVERYTHING, including the so called story of 9/11, was a planned secretly contrived by a group of people to do something unlawful or harmful correct?

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small "\textbf{Race}" is a term we only use on humans, similar to how we say, "Meat is hung, but a man is hanged."  We use "breed" for other creatures, such as dogs.  Yet, we understand that all dogs in the world are "canis lupis familiaris," and no matter what breed the dog is, you can hybridize it with another breed of dog and the mutt will still be reproductively viable.  Dogs can interbreed with wolves and coyotes as well.  However, cats cannot do this same thing.  A tiger and a lion can't hybridize to create a liger/tigon that is able to reproduce as well; all ligers and tigons are sterile.  Tigers and lions are too distinct for viable offspring.  But...they're all still cats.  If you took a Siberian tiger and bred it with a Sumatran though, you'd get a hybrid tiger that is perfectly fine...a tiger mutt.  Each of those tigers is extremely different from one another though, up to and including physical size (Siberians are absolutely massive, but Sumatran tigers are very small,) similarly to how a human of \textbf{African} origin is very different physically from someone of European origin.  (Yes, I know we're all \textbf{African} if we go far enough back, but you're missing the point if you're getting hung up here.)  We can tell the different races apart from skeletal structure alone.  No one can sit there and expect a scientifically literate person to accept that tens of thousands of years, maybe millions in some cases, of distinctly divergent evolutionary paths will leave all humans exactly the same.  I mean, we're only 1 DNA different from Chimps, so why is it that 0.1 is somehow not significant at all?  It's the difference between sloping forehead, small craniums, massive lips, forward-slanting teeth, and the inclination to communicate in grunts and head bobs that we see in some \textbf{African}, Indonesian/Polynesian, and South American populations.  These ape-like characteristics are obvious to anyone with a pair of eyes and access to google.  We may not be different enough to stop us from interbreeding and having viable offspring, but we're different enough that there ARE FACTUAL DISTINCTIONS between the races.  Most are physical...some are intellectual.  I mean, I was just listening to a \textbf{black} preacher yesterday chastizing his congregation about how in ten thousand years, \textbf{black} Africans had created \textbf{ZERO} civilizations that have withstood the test of time the same way Europeans, South Americans, or even above-Saharan civilizations have.  There is not one singular 'Wonder of the World' created by \textbf{black} Africans.  There's a reason for that.  Their evolutionary paths didn't impress upon them the need to innovate the way other civilizations did to combat things like cold or drastic seasonal changes.  All Africa dealt with was hot/dry and hot/wet.In any case...American statistics show that \textbf{African} Americans account for 50 of the crime, but only for about 12 of the overall population.  There are PLENTY of poor uneducated white pieces of shit out there (far more in number than the entire \textbf{black} population put together,) so this isn't just a problem of socioeconomic status.  If being poor was all it took to be a punk then we'd see a huge population of white thugs, and the prison statistics would more closely match the population breakdown.  But it doesn't, and you can't just blame '\textbf{racism}' as the reason for it.  There's a link on my side-bar right now recommending a video about a \textbf{black} \textbf{woman} suing Walmart because \textbf{African}-minded products were being kept under lock and key...it's not \textbf{racism}, it's statistics...more of those products get stolen than anything else.  The numbers don't give two shits what color you are or what you believe in or whether you're scientifically literate or not.Seriously...this is supposed to be biological science, not political science.

I might as well say that white people trigger \textbf{black} fragility. This whole "male, female, white, \textbf{black} fragility" doesn't hold any logic to it. It's just a way to delegitimize opinions on the basis of \textbf{race} or \textbf{sex} because they upset you, which I hate to say it, is not only a form of fragility in itself, but also a form of \textbf{racism} \&/or \textbf{sexism}.

For example there is NO proof that God exists however billions of lives have been governed by religion in some shape or fashion. My point you also fail to realize is that the video is intended to depict how \textbf{race} is much more about society and it's means to categorize when in reality we all descend from the same source. Given that we all descend from the same source the idea of hating people because they look different when in fact we are more related than not makes \textbf{racism} an absurd notion.   Moreover there is a moving counter intelligence or anti intelligence stance that has swept America.  Scientists who have dedicated decades of research in any specialized discipline of science are not given their due respect because of lay peoples feelings as opposed to facts i.e. Global climate change or flat Earthers. There is a direct correlation between those who deny Global climate change or \textbf{racism}'s existence despite volumes of evidence to the contrary.

Take strength of asian and \textbf{african} \textbf{race}, or intelligence of same races. The difference is enormous in both cases and reaches up to 50 between averages of both races.In dogs distinguishing between races is very important if you do not want to have puppies that suffer through his life.In cows distinguishing between races is important to have a cow that produces more milk vs one that is better suited for skin or meat.In humans distinguishing between races came from distinguishing between main cultural denominators. European culture is advanced and fairly empathic (that is why you, dear lady, exist), while \textbf{african} is primarily tribal.I will tell you something about races and diversity.For example Yugoslavia - a country of biggest diversity - in the beginning it was fairly nice there, than everyone started killing each other. Don't you dare forcing your ideas before you will understand what happened there and in similar countries (there are more examples).Learn the difference between USA and Yugoslavia.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small So... here is a little \textbf{mental} exercise for you...  You are lost in the deep dark woods in the Freezing cold of a winter forest...Your life depended on which breed of dog was brought in to search for and rescue your sorry ass... is your money on a PURE bred Pug, Boarder Collie, Saint Bernard or a Grey Hound?  How about an unknown parentage large mutt?  Hmmm?!Breed is synonymous with \textbf{Race}.YES, different breeds of dog can be crossed to get hybrid/mixed breed dogs Mongrels. However PURE breeds reliably exhibited both physical and behaviour traits, for which the breed is bred and known for.  A mongrel is an UNPREDICTABLE mishmash of the physical and behaviour traits of its parentage and is therefore UNABLE to reliably serve or survive in anything but the most temperate environmental and other situational conditions unassisted.  The pug would be too small and weak and cold sensitive, the greyhound ALSO additionally be too distracted by its prey chasing drive, its sense of sight far better than its senses of smell or hearing... Typical Border Collie has the energy, and Intelligence BUT it's herding instinct, and less than ideal body are disadvantages. The St. Bernard is the Ideal breed for winter search and rescue... a mix breed dog of say Border Collie and  St. Bernard... an Unpredictable mishmash of its parental traits. Neither physically nor behaviourally as suited for the Winter search and rescue job. The body may look mostly St. Bernard, but may have inherited the herding instinct of the Collie, it's sense of smell not predictably as keen as the Saint B. May be otherwise prone to other conflicting instincts, to say \textbf{nothing} of if this mongrel is comprised of 3 or more other breeds, also with incompatible instinctive and or physical traits inherited from its many deferent breed ancestors.One episode of Either 'The Dog Whisper' or 'In the Dog House' illustrates this.  The family owned a medium large white dog with a curled tail.  All of behaviour issues were not that difficult correct, except for the one persistent and most potentially dangerous even lethal behaviour trait. It would aggressively stalk and chase the youngest son who was about 8-10 years \textbf{old}. This was not the way a Collie intently stalks and chases sheep, in a none threatening way. This dog stalked and chased the boy like a lion stalks and chases a gazelle...it's eyes when he looked at the boy were that of a predator stalking its next meal.  The Dog Trainer, having helped the family overcome the other unsuitable behaviours, puzzled over this most critical issue. He finally suggested a DNA test... the Dog Trainer had never encounter this before...sensed that there was maybe something to be discovered in the dogs DNA...out of the several BREEDS of dog the DNA test showed he was a mix of... ONE was a dog bred with an Extremely HIGH PREY DRIVE HUNTING Instinct, bred and used to go after game... about the size of an average 8-10 boy.  The rest were breeds rarely if ever known to stalk, chase and or aggressively activity hunt children or other similarly sized animals. Humans are no different than dogs, horses, cats, chickens... each divided into different Breeds which are born and exhibit predictively,  breed stable traits for which they are evolved and or deliberately bred. A Mongrel is an unpredictable, Jack of All Trades , Master of None. A generalist. Ill adapted to anything but the most unchallenging environments and most low qualifications jobs. An individual who will require outside assistance to survive under environmental conditions it's Pure Breed Ancestors would thrive in unaided.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Mental, Nothing, Old, Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}4/607 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.659 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Sintell Bell "Daniel R. Oh that's why whites \& blacks can have children together but I'm pretty sure they don't share DNA logic..."Come on! 'The two can produce offspring so they must be the same species' argument went out the door in the 20th century, nature sorta f**ked (excuse the pun) that pseudoscience theory on their own,  just ask the bastard children from the horse and donkey show, or the horse and zebra, or the lion and tiger, or the result from the grizzly and polar bear debortury (and the list goes on..)  so by ur argument lions and tigers are the same species?And by your logic that must mean cows are now human or is it humans are now cows?  Same with \textbf{pigs} and chimpanzees too. Each one of those has successfully fertilised or spliced or whatever you want to call it with humans. If you don't believe me look It up. In fact scientists now even say that it is not impossible for a chimpanzee and a human to mate and fertilise an egg. They say the odds are very low but not low enough where if a mating pair or one with a group of mates, and the One species being male was specified to the pair most scepitabke then eventually a fertilised  egg will occur.  Naturally in a lab nowerdsys there is \textbf{nothing} other than morality stopping any species and human hybrids being successful. Now I am going to say that no I do not think there are different species  walking the earth at present but the future who knows, but I think this whole rejection of science and biology if it's offends is a bad slippery \textbf{slope} and I woukd like commonsense to take over society again,  I understand the reasons why (prevent \textbf{racism} and equality) but this is not feeling glum but telling people your good, for most this is trying to deny the facts you learnt growing up and what you have seen through ur life experience, and for the young who are being schooled and learning about the word this isnothing more than indoctrination,  or trying to inbed and teach a falsehood or fallacy into those who are still yet to have any real lived experiences. If this continues this will backfire badly and do the exact opposite of what the ideologs want.  They will polarise those \textbf{old} enough to see the and know what is the truth and the young being Indocrinsted with false truths eventually  will see that they were taught was ideological driven and not reality and this will drive many to the other side of the political spectrum. Heed or ignore the warning. Now back to some hard facts.There are biological differences between the different racial groups both physically and psychologically,  like on average a person of east Asian descent will have a higher IQ than a Caucasian who then will have a higher IQ than a person of sub Saharan \textbf{African} decent, but the sub Saharan \textbf{African} will be on average physically stronger/capible than the Caucasian, who then on average will be physically stronger/capible than the east Asian.  Now that isnt the rule as there are always going to be variables and some that are above or below average, but denying reality because it does not fit everybody is really just dumbing down our society and a disservice to humanity.Humans are not as close genetically across the spectrum as the ideologs like to claim their 99.9 figure has always puzzled me specially when you consider that one of the significant sub groups the sub Saharan Africans only up until very recently were in isolation and were genetically absent from the significant mutations that significantly impacted on the rest of the groups. So sub Saharan DNA containined no neanderthal or denisovan DNA and Caucasian and Asian DNA having traces of one or both   of them with mutations of between 3-4. How has the alleged variation across human beings close up from roughly 2 down to 0.1 in such a short time period (like in 500 years and only in the last 200 or so years at any real pace). Even though for like the last 200years intermixing and breeding has dramatically increased, still the part of earth that has least diversified yet has seen substantial population increase that still is effectively isolated from most of humanity. So cos of this you'd expect the odds for the variable to be increasing much better than the odds for it closing, and if one was to read a paper on the variables of humanity, one that stayed true to the scientific method and without the influences of ideological or personal etc bias or influence, it wouldn't be claiming a variable of just 0.1.Homosapians share about 99 of their DNA across the species and different sub groups.

Theres no Genetic sequence unique to blacks or whites or Asians. In fact, these categories don't reflect biological groupings at all. There is more genetic variation in the diverse populations from the continent of Africa (who some would \textbf{lump} into a 'black' category) than exists in ALL populations from outside of Africa (the rest of the world) combined!There are no specific racial genes. There are no genes that make blacks in the USA more susceptible to high blood pressure, just as there are no genes for particular kinds of cancers that can be assigned to only one racial grouping. There is no neurological patterning that distinguishes races from one another, nor are there patterns in muscle development and structure, digestive tracts, hand-eye coordination, or any other such measures. Even your point on skin color works only in a limited way as dark or light skin tells us only about a human's amount of ancestry relative to the equator, not anything about the specific population or part of the planet they might be descended from.  And as for the twins studies and adoption studies, yes some of the findings correlated, but there are also criticsms and contradictions within those studies worth noting. The findings aren't clear on a genetic basis and could very much reflect alternative explanations. there are many contradictions and quite a few other similar studies suggesting otherwise also. Indeed there are studies that have shown absolutely no difference at all and others suggesting higher precentages among groups of \textbf{migrant} backgrounds. Perhaps duke neglects to use these to further push his political agenda.There's no indisputable evidence that should be considered conclusive of the differences being due to \textbf{race} and not other factors. Obviously intelligence CAN and WILL differ, but weather that reflects direct causes from ones \textbf{race}, is a completely different topic. A topic that isn't as untouchable to criticsm as you'd think. In fact, the critisms are exactly why majority of the science community blatantly disagrees with the conclusions made from it. Your twin studies have been shown to have some methodological flaws, bias, and straight up errored comparisons. I also would like to make a point on the fact that the varying brain sizes have always had different results each time they were done and have never been consistent.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Martin Gård Alot of white nationalist tend to claim that the IQ gap between \textbf{black} people and white people has a indisputably large genetic basis, but that's largely nonsense. Adoption studies are the most effective method for attempting to quantify just how much of the \textbf{black}-white IQ gap is genetic versus environmental. By ensuring that blacks \& whites are reared in the same environment, one can conclude any differences that arise are genetic. Inversely, by ensuring that two groups of blacks are genetically similar, we can conclude that any differences that arise are environmental. There are four major transracial adoption studies that I know of. I will consider each.Study 1: Minnesota Transracial Adoption StudyI'm sure many of you have heard of this study, so I need not give it too much detail. Basically, the study examined the IQ test scores of adopted children of different races \& of non-adopted white children, all of whom were raised by white families. The study found higher IQ for the whites adoptees compared to the \textbf{black} adoptees [1]. If this study did indeed equalize the environments for blacks \& whites, then the results would seem to indicate that the IQ gap is largely genetic. However, there are two reasons to doubt that the study equalized the environments for blacks \& whites:(1) the children with two \textbf{black} parents were adopted substantially later than the other children. The average white child was adopted at about 19 months \textbf{old}, but the average child with two \textbf{black} parents was adopted at 32 months \textbf{old}. The results of the study showed that children who were adopted later had much lower IQs than those who were adopted earlier. \textbf{Black} children adopted within one year of birth had IQs 7 points higher than those adopted later, for example.(2), while the study did somewhat equalize environments after adoption, they failed to equalize environments before adoption. This can be extremely important as well. For example, a high blood lead level in infants can result in a noticeable reduction in IQ during adulthood. Blood lead level is particularly important for the blacks in this study because when this study was published in the 1970s, the blood lead level of \textbf{black} children aged 6 months-5 years was extremely higher than the level for white children of the same \textbf{age}. Thus, lead could have played a significant role in the \textbf{black} children's IQ. Blood lead level is just one example. Factors such as social stimulation before adoption are also important to a child's cognitive development, but the study could not have equalize such factors.Study 2 German IQ study by Klaus EyferthThis was a study conducted by psychologist Klaus Eyferth concerning the IQs of white and racially mixed children in West Germany. The mothers of the children studied were white German women, while their fathers were white or \textbf{black} members of the US occupation forces. The white children recorded an average IQ of 97.2, whereas the mixed children recorded an average of 96.5, a negligible difference .Some have discounted this data by asserting that the samples aren't representative of the average population because about 30 of \textbf{black} applicants were rejected and not admitted to the armed forces, while only about 3 of whites were rejected. It is true that the samples are not representative, but that doesn't discount the results of the study. Despite the unrepresentative sample, if IQ were genetic, then we would still expect the white children to have much higher scores that the \textbf{black} children because:The white GIs should have had higher scores than the \textbf{black} GIs. It is true that both the white soldiers and the \textbf{black} soldiers in this study had IQs above a certain threshold; however, the IQ scores for the white soldiers would be distributed higher than the blacks, leading to a higher average score. If the IQ gap were genetic, then we would expect this difference to be found in their children as well.(3) Regression to the mean. Even if the white soldiers and \textbf{black} soldiers had similar IQ scores, then, if the IQ gap were genetic, we would still expect the \textbf{black} children to have lower IQs than the white children. The reason is because the \textbf{black} kids' IQs would regress downward to the \textbf{black} mean of 85, while the whites kids' IQs would regress to the white mean of 100. Of course the gap between the white \& \textbf{black} kids would be smaller because both groups would have white mothers, but the gap would be larger than 0.7 points.The lack of an IQ difference in this study means that the results are not compatible with genetics being the biggest cause of the IQ gap. Like the Minnesota study, the study is flawed in its own way. Nevertheless, it is compatible with a 100 environmental explanation.Study 3 British study of young children in nurseriesIn this study, psychologist Barbara Tizard studied \textbf{black}, white, and mixed-race children raised in British long-stay residential nurseries. The children were given psychological tests to determine their cognitive abilities. The scores were converted to give a mean of 100, and a standard deviation of 10. On one test, the white children scored 102.6 and the \textbf{black}/mixed children scored 106.3. On another test, the white children scored 98.5 and the \textbf{black}/mixed children scored 98.6. On the Minnesota Nonverbal test, the white children scored 101.3 and the \textbf{black}/mixed children scored 107.7. Apparently there is a fourth test, but I didn't manage to see it in the pdf. In any case, this study clearly does not support the genetic theory. This study is compatible with a 100 environmental explanation of the IQ gap.Study 4: IQ scores of \textbf{black} children raised by white families versus \textbf{Black} familiesIn this study, psychologist Elsie Moore compared IQ test scores among 23 \textbf{black} children adopted by middle-class white families and 23 \textbf{age}-matched \textbf{black} children adopted by middle-class \textbf{black} families. Their findings indicate that the \textbf{black} children adopted by \textbf{black} families scored a 104 IQ, while the \textbf{black} children adopted by white families scored a 117 IQ. Clearly, these two groups of blacks differed in their environment and not their genes. Therefore, the difference in the \textbf{black}/white family environments must account for the 13 IQ points. Keep in mind that the \textbf{black} \& white families were of similar socioeconomic status (middle-class). In actuality, the average \textbf{black} family has a much lower socioeconomic status than the average white family, therefore the difference in \textbf{black}/white environments would account for more than 13 points, accounting for essentially the entire IQ gap. Clearly, this study is compatible with a 100 environmental explanation of the IQ gap.Many have criticized the three latter studies because they did not do follow-up testing on the children. It is true that the genetic component of IQ increases as children \textbf{age}. However, this decline is not necessarily relevant. We are concerned with the gap between blacks \& whites. The Minnesota Transracial Study implies that there is no significant change in the gap after \textbf{age} 7. Looking at this study, the \textbf{black}-white IQ gap fluctuated by only about 2 points after \textbf{age} 7. Therefore, the lack of a follow-up study is no good reason to discount the latter three studies. If the IQ gap was small for younger children, then it would likely remain as such.Conclusion: It seems to me that the evidence suggests that the IQ gap is almost entirely environmental. The Minnesota is the only adoption study that suggests otherwise, but it has flaws, as I've indicated earlier. The German study also has its flaws, so it's not clear which of those two studies should be preferred. In any case, the latter two studies seem to confirm the German study. So three of the studies are compatible with a 100 environmental explanation of the IQ gap. Taking a comprehensive account of all of the adoption studies seems to suggest that the IQ gap is, for the most part, environmental. The only way one could conclude otherwise is if they blindly accepted only one of the studies and ignored the other three that contradicted it. At best, one could argue that there's a negligible 1-5 point genetic IQ gap between blacks \& whites. Anything more is wishful thinking, based on the data.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Martin Gård "there is no problem" 🤣Lmao I just gave you like several examples on how there is a problem tho(with links!) Lmao I didn't come up with that shit. I don't understand. Dude idec you could make comparisons between wolves, prairie dogs, jackels, hyenas etc and get the same response from me.. they can be separated into distinct breeds because of small isolated groups throughout their evolution in which add emphasis on specific traits. This hasn't happened to humans, nor have humans been around nearly as long, this concept can't be applied to humans(I'll say it again and again).there's a wide variety in dog breeds because humans have been purposely breeding them for specific traits for centuries. you're taking a leap of faith by assuming this for humans as there is no real support of that claim.you're the only one who can't understand that animals are very much different from humans. Stop making the comparison. You can't compare us to animals so casually and expect to be making a genuine comparison, because you know as well as I do, how far fetched it is given the difference in evolutionary circumstances. Keep simplifying and misleading people though. you're so smart(sarcasm so intended).so tell me, is toe size effected by that Genetic variation you speak of? Does what variation that could exist add any significant advantages or disadvantages to the role your toe plays in balance? I'm genuinely concerned because I wanna Know. does finger size vary between \textbf{race}? Why isn't finger size effected by this genetic variation you speak of? Better yet, why aren't any of my internal organs effected by this Genetic variation you speak of? The organ system is just as complicated, and I find it very-very hard to believe that intelligence could be so 'vast, while everything but outside visual differences hardly differ at all. Im not denying that differences within the human \textbf{race} exist, but a few correlations along Racial lines is not enough to convince me that \textbf{race} is a direct cause or that races inherit an average directly linked to a genetic basis that is Condemning in regards to intelligence. There's no good reason to believe that there is! That's what I'm trying to tell you. Alot of you "white nationalist" try to say it's just a "fact" and that there's no problem with acknowledging differences, but then right along go ahead and use this science to reinforce your political stances (I've seen it time and time again), I freakin KNOW the history of science like this. You're just stating that there's over a hundred studies and your not even bothering to discuss not even 1.  This is bothering me, I don't like that🤣. Fyi btw Yes the science community DOES question this. The APA, the ASA, and the AAA - Some of the largest scientific and professional organizations of their field in the United States - have all reviewed and made public statements disagreeing with some of the science and especially conclusions made from it. You're really going to to tell me that you know more than national science representatives? You can dismiss all the dispute as "PC culture gone haywire" all you want, but in the end of the day, you'll never make your case valid that way.

A lot of them are just basic \textbf{common} questions you learn in school. Which blacks don't do well in schools too, but you'll probably look at it as 'genetics' instead of lack of studying. 99 of blacks are uneducated because most don't do well in schools and choose to do sports because they had been raise to like that.

It simply has no real basis on the extent of \textbf{race} and it's not as broad as you're making it out to be. This is no different from previous points of the same nature on cycle cell anemia and Africans. I'll even make it easier for you to get it, see below: [LINK]  I also explained  the extent \textbf{race} has any biological standpoint. You're really telling me that you missed all that? There are no specific racial genes, There are no genes that make blacks in the USA more susceptible to high blood pressure, just as there are no genes for particular kinds of cancers that can be assigned to only one racial grouping. Theres no Genetic sequence unique to blacks or whites or Asians.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Martin Gård the science community knows very well what their studies say. That's why these aren't notions that are excepted by  95 of the science community. It's only a select few who cater to this nonsense, and those select few have been pretty open to white \textbf{nationalism} previously to conclusions, so no, I don't trust many of these "scientists." I also find it quite interesting that you'd accuse national science representatives to be disingenuous and or liars, meanwhile taking anything said by politically incorrect media at face value. Funny how Richard Lynn and vanhanen(the scientist's that helped conduct the iQ by population) have been faulted numerous times for disregarding scientific objectivity, misrepresenting data, and for having political motives to bias the studies. The studies of cognitive ability of Africans in Lynn's meta-analysis (cited by Richard herrnstien and Charles Murray) show strong cultural bias as well. also, Lynn was reproached for concocting IQ values from test scores that have no correlation to IQ. note that Lynn excluded studies that found no difference in White and \textbf{Black} performance, and ignored the results of a studies which showed \textbf{Black} scores were higher than White scores. Scientist (such as witcherts) have shown that the iQ could reasonably be raised to about 78 for the average of Africans, using averages conducted by lynn. Also a few points to consider below in the following about the overestimations of European and Asian scores, followed by the underestimation of average scores for more impoverished nation's, may suggest that the lower scores aren't as biologically concerning as made out to be: [LINK]  [LINK]  [LINK]  [LINK]  [LINK]  [LINK]  [LINK] \normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Nationalism & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/269 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.115 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Martin Gård you probably won't be sitting under palm trees having a good ol time when you live in vast deserts in the scorching hot sun. Humans haven't had enough time to develop much variation in our DNA as compared to other animals. Humans also migrate and reproduce a lot. migration out of Africa is fairly recent in terms of an evolutionary basis. Different groups of humans are never apart long enough for genetic differences to add up. Human DNA is too similar to split us into subspecies or races. We can visually sort people into specific groups - the social construct aspect of it - but we can't use biology to sort people into groups like we can with animals. even the social construct aspect of it is hazy, because it runs deep into the same problem as the DNA aspect of it; the clustering of races that don't belong in same group(along racial lines). In other words, you'd have situations very similar to brazil - where you can change your \textbf{race} - if we used what variation that did exist to sort us into groups (specifically races).\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Race & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/189 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.529 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Martin Gård I know it is very much true. "if we hadn't had time to develop variation then why don't we look the same?"I don't know, why don't you look exactly the same as the white guy across the street from you? Why do you not look the same as the Asian guy on the same bus as you? You can draw a clear visual difference with both these circumstances, yet genetic clustering would indeed link you as the same \textbf{race}, why is that? It's simple, dude, because there is very minimal genetic variation between human races. \textbf{Race}' simply cannot be biologically defined due to genetic variation among human individuals and populations. I linked you pretty good starting point, bud. The \textbf{old} concept of the 'five races:' \textbf{African}, Asian, European, Native American, and Oceanian. According to this view, variation between the races is large, and thus, the each \textbf{race} is a separate category. Additionally, individual races are thought to have a relatively uniform genetic identity. Actual genetic variation in humans. Human populations do roughly cluster into geographical regions. However, variation between different regions is small, thus blurring the lines between populations. Furthermore, as I've mentioned before, variation within a single region is large, and there is no uniform identity. Here's an official statement from the AAA - one of the largest scientific and professional organizations of anthropologist in the United states.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Martin Gård Hey, why aren't you replying? Done talking to me? You just gave no replies today. I just came back to make a point on that imgur image you sent me. Sending pictures, and memes, simply aren't arguments. I explained to you, in pretty meticulous detail, why animal comparisons aren't a valid example when we are talking about humans. You just don't seem to get the memo, and I'm simply not going to explain it again. I'm sure if I took a picture of an overweight \textbf{elderly} polish guy in a T shirt, with a picture of a \textbf{skinny} 24 year \textbf{old} polish women in a suit next to him, and made the same comparison with the bird's up top labeled "different subspecies", you'd probably shut up about it. Also, your point on "no you won't have any situation like Brazil except when mixing" recognize that mixed people are more prevelent more and more as time goes on. Also, I think it's pretty well known that most of us aren't just 1 \textbf{race}. If the Polish and the Irish are so vastly different to you, then you most certainly would have a situation quite similar to brazil. : )Also, I think their might of been a misconception up above about the adoption studies and the twins studies. When I was speaking of "note worthy flaws" I was specifically talking about the adoption studies, Tho there's criticisms for the twins studies also. I do acknowledge the inquiry on the twins studies and how that plays into the heredity of iQ, but it's not an argument on iQ variation between races. Twin studies show that monozygotic twins exhibit similarities in IQ above the norm, suggesting that their shared DNA might play some role in the similarities. It does strongly suggest that there is some genetic factor that effects the development of IQ. However, these studies suggest differences on an individual level, and the enviroment they're referring to are twins reared in completely different families and different social enviroments, not necessarily SES, they're still within very similar populations, so yes, you don't know what you're talking about if you think the twins studies prove that a genetic explanation is linked on a geographic level(you'd just be being sloppy now).  Even if thought the test were done in many different areas, the subjects we're still in the same populations, they we're not in between different populations. The twins have been shown to share very similar social environments and living conditions as well, with culture, health, and socioecnomic class.the vast majority of these twin studies involve twins raised in very homogeneous socioeconomic conditions, parents usually have similar education and income backgrounds. httpsutu.be/pgMd8JUNBa0Something I think might interest you though. that's Nancy segal herself above, with MOLYNEUX, I'm sure you've heard of em. A list of points she made that i think contradicts how Lynn is using them, in which I highlighted below.11:20  35:15  38:30  44:55  41:48  44:40Nancy segal even explains directly out of her own mouth that these studies do not separate genetic and enviromental factors on a geographical level. She also made reference to Eric turkhrimers studies, in which he shows that enviromental factors come into play as high as 60 just within populations when the subject is subjected to an impoverished enviroment. Take note that I acknowledge the relation between iQ and biology, but not to the extent of between \textbf{race} differences. The heritability of iQ at that 80 to 86 precentage range is more correlated to higher economic status and middle class communities as explained by Nancy herself. Most of the studies are done in high middle class areas, with decent income, and with twins of the same populations, not between. It's not like one twin is living in the hood, while the other is living a middle class life of luxury. No, that's not the case at all.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Martin Gård So it doesn't matter what the American association of Anthropology, the American association of psychology, and the American statistical association believes?(literally the highest authorities in their branch which you could get facts from). I don't know where it gets more factual than that dude, sorry. Btw, No, you didn't reply to me at all. You said: "the reason I don't look the same as my neighbor is that our DNA differ ... Just like clusters of DNA differ among certain groups of people."You're almost there, buddy. : D I'm proud of you for almost understanding something. You hit the nail on the head. Key word is "just like": aka The differences between you and any other white men is virtually no bigger than the differences between populations.Take a look at these photos for instance: [LINK] There are three pairs of two members of the same species. Which pair do you think is more genetically similar? Would you guess Kanye West and Taylor Swift are more alike, or two penguins? What about Kanye and Taylor versus two chimps? It may surprise you to learn that penguins have twice as much genetic variation as humans do. And this subspecies of chimp has more genetic variation than all the humans on earth.Even though our DNA is similar, humans look very different from each other. But the traits we use to guess someone's \textbf{race} don't always work well. Think about skin color. There aren't just a few colors: there are more shades than you can ever count. The traits we use are also independent of each other. For example, being tall doesn't mean you'll also have dark hair. No matter which traits we use, there is no good way to group humans using appearance or DNA(for instance how genetic clustering may link you and an Asian guy as the same \textbf{race}). This is something that has been tried a multitude of times and the conclusion is exactly the same as I am explaining it to you now. Instead, everyone groups people into races based on the traits they think are most important. The way we categorize people into races changes over time, too. Think about people you know who are Irish or Italian. Today we might categorize them as white, like many people from Europe. But 100 years ago, they were not considered the same \textbf{race} as Americans with European origins. Humans love to organize things into groups. But when it comes to \textbf{race}, these groups tell us more about our culture than they do about our biology. Your picture of two lions, are the same argument as your picture of males and females, chimpanzees, dog breeds, polar bears and grizzlies, and every other animal species you tried to argue here. Each time I showed you how it comes down to the same exact conclusion, yet you still don't get it. \textbf{Hun}, you sir are too consumed by white supremacist propaganda to understand it. This is unproductive, because you're just being repetitive on points i already explained to you. I'm sorry, but This topic is out of your league, Please go discuss it with an expert and leave me alone.Btw, Here's a side note: If the links you shared from david duke is your root in why you can't admit your errors, then this convo is a waste of time. I'm simply not going to go through every single argument, study, and lie in David dukes book to show that you are wrong. Either cite them directly and I'll do it, or shush about it. Also, Your point on iq of 68 in Somalia and 100 in Sweden is something I already covered(I have links above on swedes iq). Methodological errors in Lynn's work are the reason \textbf{African} scores are so low. Again, Lynn was reproached for concocting IQ values from test scores that have no correlation to IQ. The misrepresentation of data is so apparent that the iQ by population is indeed an example of unworthy results in the science community. Your other point on culture and things of that matter is centered on enviroment and how we naturally associate \textbf{race} into groups. Think of it like this, can you give birth to a child that looks exactly the same as your neighbor, with a separate individual of the same \textbf{race}, who has no affiliation with said neighbor? This is essentially what you're expecting me to answer. : )The manipulation is quite apparent, Lynn largely over-estimated China (+22), Japan (+7) to make East-Asians cluster on top, thus protecting himself from accusations of nordicism and giving support to the inter-cultural validity of the IQs that he cherry-picked. The western European and Russian  data remained mostly unchanged. Vietnam (+11) and Thailand (+5) were given a bonus for their genetic proximity to North-East Asia that is supposed to make them score in the low 90s despite their lack of development. Little changes were brought to the scores of the Latin American, Middle-Eastern and Austronesian countries usually scoring in the mid-80s. Major fraud (+14 in Pakistan, +7 in Bangladesh) was done to lift up South-Asian countries out of the 70s range and excluding Sub-Saharan Africa as the only region scoring 70 or below and downgrading Nigeria (-4) and the DR. Congo (-7) in the process. Iq by population is indeed found by undisclosed, unsystematic and un-replicable methodology.  The researchers say themselves that they collected data from 44 of countries. In other words, they FABRICATED data which is a cardinal sin in the sciences. You can find this all directly from Lynn's own data(which is where this finding is from).

And disparities in the world should not be a reason why you believe what you believe because it wasn't long ago that Japan and other Asian countries were in the same predicament. it wasn't long that European countries were in similar predicaments. Africas economy is the fastest growing economy in the world, weather conservatives choose to acknowledge this fact or not. I believe strongly that this is not at all the reason why you believe it. you're not taking it seriously at all. There's no way you COULD be taking it seriously while believing something as evil as what you believe now! Given how persistent discrimination towards those groups are. You think it's a coincidence that this concept lines so well with white supremacist notions? No, it's not. It IS white supremacy!! It blatantly is! You should believe otherwise because of how much proof you have of enviromental and cultural explanations. but no, you'd rather believe in white supremacy, because it's emotionally satisfying to you, and perfectly aligns with your false Paradigms. The fact that these aren't notions that are supported by the vast majority of scientist should be proof. The fact that people on the alt right blatantly lie should be proof. These notions are in place because of political notions and propaganda that frightens them. that's it.There's a shit load of reasons you should believe otherwise and I gave you the half of em. It's easy to dismiss anything as "a genetic explanation". It's no different than why dismissing every out of place phenomenon as a work of 'god' rather than evolution. Evolution is alot more complicated to explain and it's a shit ton easier to just dismiss it for a higher power. This is no different from your genetic explanation. You see how hard it is to argue flat earthers or religious people, right? Well this is exactly the same. You're currently taking an irrational stance to support something that literal experts tell you and show you it's flawed. You're persuaded by emotionally satisfying data that a lines perfectly with your false Paradigms. They want diversity for people to find \textbf{common} ground between our races so that we don't have radicals like you swarming and acting a fool all over the place.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Martin Gård Many \textbf{race} scientist argue that education programs have failed to close racial gaps, that studies haven't proved that getting adopted has much lasting effect on kids' IQ scores, and that collective increases in IQ scores are based on \textbf{race} mixing and other factors other than 'general' intelligence(I have rebuttals for all of these claims btw, but I won't look for them and cite them directly because you don't except anything I cite). These are complex disputes full of nuances about replicating studies, interpreting test questions, and extrapolating from trend lines. But notice how far we've drifted from biology. The science here is abstract, and tenuous. Are you still comfortable speculating about genetics? Are you confident, for instance, that studies that compare \textbf{black} children to white children properly account for family assets and neighborhood, which differ sharply by \textbf{race} even within the same income bracket? It's rather poor science for a conclusion as heavy as it suggest. Dismissing these factors leaves a person of color very vulnerable, weather you prefer to admit it or not. Given the dubiousness of linking racial genetics to IQ, you are oppening contribute to prejudice of blaming communities for their own poverty, provoking thought of offering whites an excuse not to think about the social and economic causes of inequality. Excusing any interest in considering the many different ways people may use this science is eventful, again, weather you prefer to admit it or not. I have yet to see one hereditarian acknowledge this very important factor when considering this, even with the little-little proof you have.

Far from 'denying science and reality', this is an explicitly pro-science argument, which clarifies what science can tell us (i.e. \textbf{race} and iQ are correlated) and what it can't (i.e. that the association is casual and due to genetic difference).****"Dna supports my notion completely since DNA is what decides human development since birth. I don't "believe" anything. I observe." ****Enviroment is never excluded when talking about genetics, dude. But sure, I'll bite:1.   Skin color clusteringSo, if you find an \textbf{Indian} whos just as dark as an \textbf{African} are you going to cluster them as the same \textbf{race}? What about if you find an Asian who's as light as a Brit? The result is a continuous straight line ranging from the darkest extremes to the lightest extremes in skin color. There are no identifiable clusters. . . . Researchers are of course free to subdivide this continuum into different groups, but such clustering would be arbitrary and subjective in terms of the number of groups and the cutoff points used to distinguish them. The lack of apparent clusters is a reflection of the fact that skin color shows a classic pattern of clinal variation. Like many traits used to measure \textbf{race}, skin color exhibits clinal variation, along a cline or smooth gradient between the extremes. 2.   Skull clusteringRelethford explained this in his book "the human species". The differences cluster according to geographic region and reflect genetic relationships (Global patterns of craniometric variation reflect largely underlying patterns of genetic relationship, which in turn reflect geographic structure).He goes on to explain basically that although it is possible to discern geographic ancestry by continent, the number of groups which could be classified and the geographic cutoffs would be "subjective decisions".3.   Bone clusteringI explained earlier that Racial classification is an inexact science. Forensic anthropologists do not cannot make definitive ancestry pronouncements. They say a bone is 'consistent with' European ancestry or 'likely' of Asian ancestry. there isn't a specific shape within the races, it is again, possibility rate. \textbf{Race} is indeed a social construct if anything, obviously there are phynotypic differences that are distinctive, but there's no genetic basis that difines the races traditionally.****"Yeah, they are in some development in some regions because when society consists of mud huts it's not that hard to grow."*****This is a false claim and I explained to you why in pretty meticulous detail above. I won't explain again. Geographics in Africa and enviromental challenges are alot tougher than what we see in European countries now. Spend a week with no resources in land locked Africa and we'll see how well you thrive. ****"What has always happened so far is that when blacks take over control of any white place in Africa, it's just a matter of time before it all falls apart. I take observable Reality seriously. \textbf{Nothing} else. Reality evil? Well.. don't blame me for that. I didn't construct it."****But you know that's not true. Africa has indisputably the fastest growing economy. You don't take anything seriously from what I can tell. Otherwise, you'd understand how destructive and dangerous people like you are. "Is reality evil?" No, but what you draw from that "Reality" is. Unfortunately, it doesn't phase you at all. Good luck with that, Martin. ****"There is no discrimination against any blacks. It's the other way around. White pay for blacks welfare. Blacks get affirmative actions at the expense of whites. Not the other way around"****"At the expense of whites" you do realize that Whites statistically use more welfare than blacks, right?  you don't think that comes out of \textbf{black} pockets as well? It comes at the expense of the wealthy. in other words, if it is "white people", then it's obviously because they have the advantages of being wealthy, Unlike \textbf{black} people, which is proof of racial inequality of the past lingering on in the present. Of ourse there is discrimination against blacks, Martin. You and people like you are indisputable proof of that. You are the rebrandishing of white supremacy with all of the ordeals, minus the radical violence, yet you're \textbf{blind} to see it. Blacks get affirmative action to equalize the disadvantages of disparities we live in that are factually a result of oppression and discrimination towards \textbf{black} people. Do you need a history class, Martin? Connect the dots, Martin. 400 years of slavery, 150 years of freedom, We haven't even hit 200 years yet, funny. Most of us are only 2 to 3 generations away from it, Martin. Now tell me what went on in that 150 years of "freedom"?  Let me bring your brain around the block to jog your freaking memory. 100 years of \textbf{Jim c\textbf{row}} laws, do you Know what that is? Do you know what went on doing that time? Take note, because parts of my family lived through it. If you think that everything was equal and fair during \textbf{Jim c\textbf{row}} then you're just ignorant. 100 years out of that 150 was spent on \textbf{Jim c\textbf{row}} laws. would you like to explain to me how you expect there not to be any draw backs after Mass inequalities bordering on restrictions of basic human rights? That 50 years after \textbf{Jim c\textbf{row}}, do you really think that inferiority complex disappeard like a puff of smoke? You ever heard of the war on drugs, Do you think that predicament was fair?? Have you seen our Crime rate, we are 12 precent of the us population and commit 50 percent of the us crime, you don't think that has draw backs on progress? Our cultural standards are surrounded by a thug mentality. All of this is stemmed from poverty, because as poverty is persistent the crime rate rises. Poverty puts you at an overload of disadvantages associated with it. That's why it takes time for the rest of the world to catch up, understand that Majority of our world dwells in poverty. You claim that discrimination is "the other way around" yet you probably live in a 95 white area. The rules very much can reverse, it is a result of that minority status, not necessarily that you are \textbf{colored}. ****"If paying for blacks existance in white countries is white supremacy then I would like to know what the opposite is.. blacks paying welfare and creating affirmative actions for whites in Africa.. Ever seen that? No you haven't. It has never happened. So complain about \textbf{black} supremacy in Africa instead where it actually exists. Genetics is just how life works. That goes for humans too. No exceptions. It's not me that claims that evolution don't effect humans... It's you that is being religious that claims humans somehow is not effected by it and all are the same. Which we clearly are not.

The western European and Russian  data remained mostly unchanged. Vietnam (+11) and Thailand (+5) were given a bonus for their genetic proximity to North-East Asia that is supposed to make them score in the low 90s despite their lack of development. Little changes were brought to the scores of the Latin American, Middle-Eastern and Austronesian countries usually scoring in the mid-80s. Major fraud (+14 in Pakistan, +7 in Bangladesh) was done to lift up South-Asian countries out of the 70s range and excluding Sub-Saharan Africa as the only region scoring 70 or below and downgrading Nigeria (-4) and the DR. Congo (-7) in the process. Iq by population is indeed found by undisclosed, unsystematic and un-replicable methodology.  The researchers say themselves that they collected data from 44 of countries.

What his research cannot do is identify the specific environmental or family factors that contribute to the variations in IQ among impoverished groups.

These wealth and iQ correlations aren't necessarily proof of between \textbf{race} genetic endowment. While it is true that among middle class groups, heritability can apply too an extent. It is also true that there have been studies that suggest that as groups are subjected to more of the extremes of poverty, enviromental contributions can come into play as high as 60, just in the United States alone. given this, it doesn't seem reasonable to apply this standard - heritability - on a geographical level, you'd be extending science past it's explantatory power. When you consider the fact that these circumstances of a 60 correlation to enviroment can apply in one of the richest countries on the earth, I'd imagine those differences would be overwhelmingly at play within societies like, say, Somalia where some populations dwell in poverty. If you think about applying this standard compared to entire societies that dwell in poverty, it'd make sense that the extremes would be twice that 60 precent standard that was brought up in the us. It's definitely a topic that is worth investment, but I just don't believe it's moral or even remotely rationale to make such extreme conclusions with the information conducted thus far and apply it to your political stances. "Different outcomes is not proof of oppression." No. history and the concept of generational wealth is proof of oppression. It is a fact that the ghettos are formed from past segregation, and given that these unsuccessful blacks are poor within groups, and not separately, proves this truth also"Wasn't it you that wanted to look at people just as individuals instead of grouping them into races?"Yes, but society just doesn't work that way.

Keep trying to argue tho. "Just because you have some wealth in a family doesn't mean they have been oppressing someone" dude, that's not even remotely close to what I was implying.

The long term effects of past discrimination on confined groups doesn't just suddenly disappear with a few changes(generational wealth). The lingering poverty among people of color are due to generational wealth - they inherit the hood - and there's not many middle class \textbf{black} neighborhoods or cities to retreat to, so blacks will retreat to the hood.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Jada regarding the theory that \textbf{nobody} is better than anyone else. I would recommend you do some research on global IQ averages. In particular have a look at the figures for \textbf{African} continent university graduates compared to the rest of the world. The uncomfortable truth is that people are not equal. There is always someone smarter than you, and they dont have to be whiter. People are not equals, men are not the same as women. Not being equal doesnt mean there is anything wrong with you or that you should have less rights, but being less equal also shouldnt give you rights above your superiors. This global drive to make people believe this kind of unsubstantiated 'science' that we are all the same causes more problems than it fixesRegarding the general notion of eliminating \textbf{racism}, I agree it will never go away, but this is because the use of the term continues to creep in to areas of society it has no place in. If you act like an asshat and are non-white the ‘\textbf{racist}' card stays constantly in your toolbox ready to be pulled out if you are ever challenged on your behaviour by someone of a different \textbf{race} to you. If you are white, an ass hat and a criminal then anyone that treats you negatively is justified. If you are non-white an ass hat and a criminal, anyone that treats you negatively is a \textbf{racist}. In many circumstances it is the person that calls someone \textbf{racist} that is the \textbf{racist} as they inject the angle in to the situation. For example you have a neighbour from hell and they are non-white. If you are white and complain then you are \textbf{racist}. If you have a neighbour from hell that is white and you are non-white, then they must be acting that way because they are \textbf{racist}. For most white people, they just see good and bad behaviour in people, but it is hard not to notice that certain groups (due to skin color or origin) seem to think they have extra rights to act however they want for no other reason than their \textbf{race} or something that whites did to their distant ancestors.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Racism wasn't created by any group \& isn't tied to any time period.  In general, \textbf{racism} is simply a subcategory of how humans perceive others.  Like any other ism (\textbf{sexism}, \textbf{ageism}...) \textbf{racism} is something that occurs naturally as a defense mechanism.  It's how the human mind simplifies very complex situations as a means to result in the best possible outcome.  The problem is that \textbf{racism} is always used to represent something evil and is never really discussed in it's true form.  If I assume \textbf{woman} don't want to grow up to become plumbers, I would probably be correct.  However, the fact that I have assumed something about someone else without asking them first makes me a terrible person.  On the other hand, my assumption could save me a lot of time \& money when targeting an audience for job opportunity as a plumber.  I could also assume that a 90 year \textbf{old} man wouldn't really care much about playing video games.  Same rule would apply, I am evil for assuming but I am also right 99 of the time.  When it comes to \textbf{racism}, we base our assumptions off of many factors and many times our assumptions will be correct.  With that being said, it is important to understand that having \textbf{racist} assumptions does not mean that you are filled with hatred.  Now, there are small groups who are filled with hatred; which makes the whole \textbf{racism} thing a very difficult topic to logically discuss.  In fact, we use the exact same ism when discussing \textbf{racism} and try to group people together \& use strawman arguments to support our claims (ex.. White supremacists are republicans so therefore, all republicans are white supremacists) or (cops arrest \textbf{black} men at a higher rate than white people therefore, all cops are white supremacists).  \textbf{Racism} can't be deleted because it is built into us.  Would you ask a \textbf{woman} who has been raped to hang out with more men with the intention of fixing her sexist views?  The same would apply to a police officer who is patrolling a \textbf{black} neighborhood where people are shot every day.  Sure, there are many decent \textbf{black} individuals in the world, however in the world of that police officer many \textbf{black} people are dangerous.   Should the police officer forget everything he knows about the people he encounters on a daily basis and imagine that he is patrolling a retirement community in Beverly Hills?

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I don't know how you explain the theory that \textbf{racism} is  "built into" us.  An innocent White child isn't born  hating the \textbf{Black} baby in the hospital bed next to her. \textbf{Racism} is a product of environmental upbringing. FEAR, as in fight or flight, is instinctive. Some scientists argue that as we evolve, we are losing some of that instinct. Perhaps this accounts for the growing amount of irrational fear or lack of. A White person is walking down the street and suddenly sees a lion walking toward him, growling. That person is AFRAID because he knows he can't outrun a lion or fight him off. If he's walking down the street and sees a \textbf{Black} person, he's only afraid based on what he knows(or what he has been told)  about \textbf{Black} people. So, yes, a White cop (or a \textbf{Black} cop for that matter) patrolling a known-to-be-violent \textbf{Black} neighborhood has his guard up. he also has a gun and TASR. Conversely, a \textbf{Black} child doesn't grow up fearing a White child unless that \textbf{Black} child has been repeatedly exposed to harm by Whites, or is 'TAUGHT" and TOLD OVER AND OVER that Whites are bad people.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Racism & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}9/197 & \cellcolor{green!27}4.569 \\  \hline

Back to my point \textbf{racism} is a learned behaviour that can be unleared we (all of us) are programmed by society to be \textbf{racist} and it is a system that ( for the most part) benefits white people and hinders people of colour. Can people of colour be \textbf{racist} well yes they can, however the implications and consequences are very different a person of colour who hold the believe that people of colour are superior to white people because of skin colour there would be little to no benefit from this but the lack of benefit does not prevent a person's point of view or belief.There is a superlative definition of \textbf{racism} which is prejudice + power but you do not need those two things to be \textbf{racist} as described above so you need. \textbf{Racism} is a prejudice but in order to benefit from said prejudice you need power. Who has the power prodominaly white people and I say prodominaly because over the decades that power is slowly being redistributed people of colour are gaining influential powers persitions in the world and while the scales of power are not level that doesn't mean that it's impossible nor futile.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small andre williams I think the best way to observe this is to include all races, including Asians and Native Americans. People in Asia and Europe had harsher winters and had to develop clothes and shelters that allowed them to survive in a more diverse climate, whereas Africans had a hotter climate and only needed to stay cool all year rather than cool and warm. Also, access to water, metal and other civilizations was a big thing. The Egyptians for example had easy access to water through the Nile as well as Europeans and Asians through the Mediterranean. As for IQs today, class is a better indicator than \textbf{race} in my opinion, although segregation led to \textbf{race} being a prevalent factor in education (for ex. blacks with rich parents that go to private school have higher IQs than white students that go to a southern public school in the us)\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Race & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/149 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.342 \\  \hline

The reason I asked the question was after watching this  [LINK] \textbf{Race} wise I believe humans are like lions and tigers ect.. they are cats but different species of cat. Hence we are all human but different species of human. There's \textbf{nothing} wrong with being different. Yes we all share chemistry to a degree just like lions and tigers do, but they have very different behaviours and appearance. I believe different races do also to an extent.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small In biology, a species is the basic unit of classification and a taxonomic rank, as well as a unit of biodiversity, but it has proven difficult to find a satisfactory definition. Scientists and conservationists need a species definition which allows them to work, regardless of the theoretical difficulties. If as Linnaeus thought, species were fixed, there would be no problem, but evolutionary processes cause species to change continually, and to grade into one another. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by \textbf{sexual} reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, when looked at more closely it is problematic. For example, with hybridisation, in a species complex of hundreds of similar microspecies, or in a ring species, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear. Among organisms that reproduce only asexually, the concept of a reproductive species breaks down, and each clone is potentially a microspecies. Problems also arise when dealing with fossils, since reproduction cannot be examined; the concept of the chronospecies is therefore used in palaeontology. Other ways of defining species include their karyotype, DNA sequence, morphology, behaviour or ecological niche.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Sexual & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/195 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.513 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Johann Friedrich Blumenbach created .....\textbf{RACE} (11 May 1752 – 22 January 1840) was a German physician, naturalist, physiologist, and anthropologist. He was one of the first to explore the study of mankind as an aspect of natural history. His teachings in comparative anatomy were applied to his classification of human races, of which he determined there were five. He was a member of the Göttingen School of History. Beliefs on races.Blumenbach's five races.Blumenbach's work included his description of sixty human crania (skulls) published originally in fascicules as Decas craniorum (Göttingen, 1790–1828). This was a founding work for other scientists in the field of craniometry. He divided the human species into five races in 1779, later founded on crania research (description of human skulls), and called them (1793/1795):the Caucasian or white \textbf{race}.the Mongolian or \textbf{y\textbf{e\textbf{llow}}} \textbf{race}, including all East Asians and some Central Asians.the Malayan or brown \textbf{race}, including Southeast Asian and Pacific Islanders.the Ethiopian or \textbf{black} \textbf{race}, including sub-Saharan Africans.the American or \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} \textbf{race}, including American Indians.Further anatomical study led him to the conclusion that 'individual Africans differ as much, or even more, from other Africans as from Europeans'.Further anatomical study led him to the conclusion that 'individual Africans differ as much, or even more, from other Africans as from Europeans'.Blumenbach argued that physical characteristics like skin color, cranial profile, etc., depended on geography, diet, and mannerism. Like other monogenists such as Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, Blumenbach held to the "degenerative hypothesis" of racial origins. Blumenbach claimed that Adam and Eve were Caucasian inhabitants of Asia, (see Asia hypothesis),[10] and that other races came about by degeneration from environmental factors such as the sun and poor diet. Thus, he claimed, Negroid pigmentation arose because of the result of the heat of the tropical sun, while the cold wind caused the tawny colour of the Eskimos, while the Chinese were fair-skinned compared to the other Asian stocks because they kept mostly in towns protected from environmental factors. He believed that the degeneration could be reversed in a proper environmental control and that all contemporary forms of man could revert to the original Caucasian \textbf{race}.Furthermore, he concluded that Africans were not inferior to the rest of mankind 'concerning healthy faculties of understanding, excellent natural talents and \textbf{mental} capacities',and is quoted as saying the following:"Finally, I am of opinion that after all these numerous instances I have brought together of negroes of capacity, it would not be difficult to mention entire well-known provinces of Europe, from out of which you would not easily expect to obtain off-hand such good authors, poets, philosophers, and correspondents of the Paris Academy; and on the other hand, there is no so-called savage \textbf{nation} known under the sun which has so much distinguished itself by such examples of perfectibility and original capacity for scientific culture, and thereby attached itself so closely to the most civilized nations of the earth, as the \textbf{Negro}." He did not consider his "degenerative hypothesis" as \textbf{racist} and sharply criticized Christoph Meiners, an early practitioner of scientific racialism, as well as Samuel Thomas von Sömmerring who concluded from autopsies that Africans were an inferior \textbf{race}. Blumenbach wrote three other essays stating non-white peoples are capable of excelling in arts and sciences in reaction against racialists of his time.These ideas were far less influential. His ideas were adopted by other researchers who used them to encourage scientific \textbf{racism}. Blumenbach's work was used by many biologists and comparative anatomists in the nineteenth century who were interested in the origin of races, including Wells, Lawrence, Prichard, Huxley and William Flower.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Mental, Nation, Negro, Race, Racism, Racist, Red, Yellow & \cellcolor{green!5} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Ethnicity - Asian (East- China, Japan, Korea, Philippines, Vietnam), Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Ethnicity - Native-American, Nationality - Chinese, Nationality - General, Nationality - Japanese, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}19/606 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.135 \\  \hline

And since a meeting with a human from another tribe could possibly result in violence we developed a natural sceptisism towards strangers. Also the fact that we are slightly less adept at interpreting the body-language of a human from a different socalled \textbf{race}, makes us psychologically less secure when interacting with others who do not look like ourselves. In addition we are biologically programmed to secure our own offspring, and the less a person looks like you, we subconsiously assume that it's less likely that the person shares your genes, and more likely to be seen as competitors towards your 'own'.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Race has no biological basis? As Richard Dawkins would put it: you're either ignorant, stupid or insane. \textbf{Black} people have more melanin than any other \textbf{race} on the planet because they evolved in an extremely hot environment. High amounts of melanin, which causes the dark pigmentation in the skin, absorbs less ultraviolet radiation from the sun, increasing the survivability of sub-Saharan Africans (A.K.A \textbf{black} people) in their environment. White people don't have as much melanin as \textbf{black} people because they evolved in a cold environment with much less sunlight. Therefore, they evolved to absorb as much sunlight as possible since it contains Vitamin D which allows the body to absorb calcium which strengthens bones.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small While I don't agree with the idea of there being more than one \textbf{race} of humans as we wouldn't be able to produce healthy off spring if there were, this video contradicts itself several times in an effort to push what seems like an extreme left bias. For example, while I agree that we should teach children to be tolerant of each other you can't claim one view point is learned and then suggest in the same breath that the other viewpoint must be learned to prevent the first. I think if you were to drop a bunch of children into an environment without adult supervision they would most likely divide themselves along the lines of skin colour or other unalterable genetic traits (who's taller, hair colour etc.). Another example is when you say we're not all that different but later describe these different heritages as "different branches on the evolutionary tree" Well that's a pretty big difference! According to evolution, the only reason we are different from chimps is because we took a different evolutionary branch, I would better describe the difference between a person of Asian decent and a person of \textbf{African} decent as different leafs on the same branch. My note here, as with other DNews and now Seeker videos is just to watch your bias, though with regard to Seeker I have been impressed lately at how often you have been willing to tackle the uncomfortable facts rather than the popular myths. Thank you.Also, a particular note about certain diseases being more prevalent among certain heritage groups. You said that this was essentially baseless but that is unequivocally false. It has long been observed by the naked eye that Asian people are more likely to be born with a "double eyelid" and it is well know that people of south Asian decent are more likely to develop diabetes.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Russell Gilchrest I agree with you, but you have a misconception so let me correct you. I understand that you're thinking those \textbf{black} skins are blaming you for what your grandad did, but that's not the origin of their anger, infact they are trying to forget those. While they are trying to forget those, there will be a white man who smoothly throws mockery comment on them, this just remembers blacks everything of their past, they hate white people but more than that, they hate their ancestors and themselves for being \textbf{black}. I might not be in your country but I've visited US, New York for official purpose. When I went to car dealership with one of my colleague who was white. A \textbf{black} guy who was working there as a finance manager, explained the loan process, after he left my colleagues started whispering "tribes yesterday, finance advisor today" laughing, and other person saying "you know when you realise that the world is going \textbf{crazy}, when Angels are going down and demons are rising up that's when you realise the world is going to hell". I don't understand why some white people consider themselves as people from heaven and blacks as people from hell, he wasn't the first guy to tell it but it didn't make sense. WHITE SUPREMACY is a core reason for this, not the history. We live in a world where it is considered WHITE=rich, clean, godliness, honorable, leader, heroic. \textbf{BLACK}=poor, dirty, worst, slaves, demons, rough, evil, villians.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I have 2 points that the speaker completely avoided that would answer, "The Science of \textbf{Racism}".1) The brain is constantly looking for patterns, especially when it comes to the survival instinct.  Example:  Someone walks up to you and slaps you in the face.  As they run away, you notice that they are wearing \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} shoes.  The next day someone else slaps you in the face and runs away wearing \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} shoes.  The next day the same thing happens with someone else and they are wearing \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} shoes.  A stereotype is born from that experience. What will you do the next time someone approaches you wearing \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} shoes?  Be careful what you answer or else you might be labeled a naughty word like \textbf{racist}.2) People feel more comfortable around other people that are like themselves, things that they both have in \textbf{common}.  Example: Interests in sports, fashion, makeup, cars, electronics, charities.  You went to the same school, grew up in the same town, have the same religion, help the same charity, have the same culture.  You look similar, in that you are the same color. Certain "races" grow up in the same areas with the same interests and cultures.  Unfamiliar culture and religion makes people uncomfortable. Its not that you are \textbf{racist}, its that you feel more comfortable around those that are like you.

If someone thinks that white supremacy, or at least one ideology that is a part of it, is positive in some way, at least, I don't see it as much of a leap to make the declaration that they believe that white supremacists, themselves, are good people.  That wasn't even my argument, or a part of it; yet, in bringing it up \&, then, .."Learn to fucking read."...by criticizing me as if that was a part of my argument...you prove just how much of a fucking moron you are.

She states that \textbf{race} does not exist (and, to boot, she claims, without argument, that the non-existence of a thing is not sufficient for a thing's being real) and there is no biological  for \textbf{race}. The host then proceeds to quantify \textbf{race} into existence and provide a biological basis for the very thing she is arguing against. Her talk of 'populations' is simply smoke and mirrors-- she's actually talking about \textbf{race} and is disguising it by using a different term. Look, a small genetic variation still exists no matter how small it is, and it's especially real if there are visible and publicly observable differences between "populations." So what if the genetic variation between a celt and a nord is >.1? If we are able to locate a variance in genetic disposition and there are visible differences between the two classes, then \textbf{race} is real and \textbf{race} likely exists. And apart from the inconsistencies held by the postmodern left, you're still left with the usual terminological  disaster.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Phenotypical adaptation and evolution are not the same thing. \textbf{Race} in science is indeed entirely different than what we consider races to be in humans (Cline/Differences in Phenotype). Our ability to discern differences amongst ourselves does not prove literal genetic differences that are significant. A large enough population that breeds will eventually have \textbf{common} differences from other groups and that is why certain "races" are not inbreeding (someone brought this up). This is also why more closely related groups look more similar than less closely related groups. i.E. Chinese people look similar to Japanese and Korean people who look similar to Haiwain and Alaskan natives... or well.. look at Europe. There's a reason why we basically call /everyone there just "White" people even though there are many ,many different types and blood lines and groups and they do have differences. It is why you can say someone looks French or Italian or German or English....  But despite all of these things... we still for some reason categorize our differences based on skin color (and sometimes... culture). That is like judging someone based on hair color, eye color,  or any other inherited trait. It also ignores the fact that \textbf{black} people, as an example, can have extremely pale skinned children that are not albino. Pretty much to the point of being "white".

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Race is also more than skin deep... It is in fact very easy to determine a person's \textbf{race} simply from a skeleton or even a skull. White, \textbf{Black}, American Indians and Asian skulls for instance, have key features that are easily distinguishable from one another. Forensic investigators use these features all the time to determine the \textbf{race} of a victim when all they find is a skull. Here are some of the features Forensic Investigators use to determine the \textbf{race} of a person from a skull:The palate and palatine suture:  The hard palate is the \textbf{bony} structure at the top of the mouth bordered by the upper teeth. In American Indians, the palate is elliptical, with the ‘U' shape angling in at the back teeth. In blacks, the palate is hyperbolic—a perfect ‘U' shape with straight lines. And in whites, the palate is parabolic with the ends of the ‘U' flaring outwards. The transverse palatine suture that horizontally transects the palate also varies by \textbf{race}: It is straight in American Indians, curved in blacks, and a jagged line in whites.The nose: The nose provides multiple \textbf{race} indicators. In whites, the nasal aperture is long and narrow, with a high bridge and a sharp nasal sill (the lower edge of the nasal aperture projects sharply outwards). In blacks, the nasal aperture is short and wide with a low bridge and a guttered or trough-like nasal sill. In American Indians, the nasal aperture is medium-sized with both a medium bridge and nasal sill.Teeth: Whites tend to have smaller teeth, often with significant crowding. Blacks rarely have crowding and the upper teeth often project outwards due to the angled shape of the maxilla. American Indians have well spaced teeth but often exhibit sclerosed dentition—when calcium deposits build up inside the tooth, thinning the root canal—leaving teeth loose within the mandible and easily cracked. The shape of the incisors is also an important indicator of \textbf{race} in the teeth. In American Indians (and East Asians, both of \textbf{Mongoloid} ancestry), the incisors are shovel-shaped, named because the inner surface is scooped or curved. \textbf{Black} and whites both have blade-form incisors where the tooth has a flat profile.The mastoid process: The shape of the mastoid process differs between the races. In blacks, the \textbf{bony} projection is wide, in whites it is narrow and pointed, and in American Indians, a secondary smaller projection forms on the back surface of the mastoid process.All these differing physical features between the races are a scientific fact, that is why they are used by Forensic investigators in order to determine \textbf{race}.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Bony, Mongoloid, Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments, Physical Identity - Physical Features & \cellcolor{green!5}12/435 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.759 \\  \hline

In fact, I think people of different races need to respect each other more.The biggest racists are in fact the people that claim \textbf{race} is a social construct. Why? Because these people are so \textbf{racist}, that they cannot stand the idea that other people have a right to be different or a right to belong to a different \textbf{race}.

This is because of environmental pressure, population dynamics and the fact that human DNA tends to change all the time. These are not driven by \textbf{race} but by environment. If you put a million Europeans in Africa then the ones who have alleles that allows them to be good enough to survive will be passed over the most and they will evolve into looking more like the people in Africa. Biologically speaking, humans are not intrinsically divided into different races since the fact that human alleles are shared across borders allows for the presence of false positives and false negatives when grouping individuals into races which would have been arbitrarily been determined by mankind itself.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small That was very-well put and I agree.Nonetheless, it's gonna be really hard to get the majority of people to not group-together people who have overtly similar genetic traits (particularly the ones that determine physical appearance).  Likewise, I make a point to not use the term "\textbf{race}" when describing the bearers of a particular clump of human gene combos that appear similar, on the outside.  Though many may disagree, I feel that the term "breed" is more appropriate as humans are all of the same specie and merely bear the traits that their sexually reproducing parents managed to survive more efficiently with in their respective environments.  So I keep-on either describing peoples' particular genetic traits or using the term "breed", hoping it'll catch-on.As aforementioned, though, we'd be hard-pressed to get the masses to stop using the term "\textbf{race}" in its most \textbf{common} context.  Humans seem to be inclined to designate groups and patterns and such, in-order to make cognition easier.  I think that that just might be the reason for the concept of multiple human "races".  This was probably reinforced in the times, back before technological advancement made it easier for people of particular genetic make-ups to live in environments that their bodies weren't suited for; people probably tended to stay in the environments that their bodies were best suited for, making it more likely for them to be among people with similar genetic make-up, making it more likely for them to be among people who looked similar to themselves.  When someone ventured into a foreign environment, the humans who were adapted to said foreign environment probably appeared as a separate \textbf{race}, what with them not only looking different, but also being surrounded only by similar-looking humans (as different animal "populations" within the same biome often do).It does seem to be true, though, that certain disease disorder susceptibilities tend to coincide, noticeably often, with gene combinations that determine particular appearance classifications.  An example would be that the gene(s) that increase(s) susceptibility to sickle-cell anaemia seem(s) to coincide, in humans, with the gene(s) that produce(s) skin hues that are darker on the human skin hue spectrum and or with the gene(s) that produce(s) noses that are wider on the human nose width spectrum and or with gene(s) that produce(s) lips that are thicker on the human lip thickness spectrum and or with the gene(s) that produce(s) curly hair.  Such observations have lead to inferences that people with ancestors whose genetic make-up enabled them to thrive in the environments of Sub-Saharan Africa (the "breed" of human that the above "appearance classification" tends to describe) are more likely to bear the genetic make-up that produces sickle-cell anaemia.While the inferences that humans come-up-with can often be wrong and maybe even detrimental, the observations that lead to these inferences are rather perceptive astute, if you ask me.Plus, if there weren't broader concepts under which to classify trends in human phenomena (such as the concepts of human "\textbf{race}" or "breed"), then descriptions of each human-appearance-concerning phenomenon would, more-than-likely, be as long-winded as this one.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Common, Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}5/512 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.977 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The sickle cell anaemia is due to the fact that being heterozygous for the disease provides resistance to malaria, so is advantageous. So, if carrying the gene, you're more likely to survive in an \textbf{African} country where malaria is prevalent, and pass down the gene. However, that also increases the chances that any offspring will inherit sickle cell anaemia. So it's not really racial...it's environmental. Where malaria is present, there will be more sickle cell anaemia. Pale skin is more likely to burn, it's true. It's an adaptation to suck more vitamin D in from the sun in areas that are often cold and rainy...like Europe, for example. I'm from England, and it's rare that I'll burn in my home country. However, if I go abroad to sunnier areas in the world, I need some pretty strong suncream to avoid burning. The other way around is also true - if you are living in a wet rainy country with not a lot of sun, and have a dark skin tone, you're likely to struggle to get enough vitamin D. In terms of \textbf{race}, it really did just come about as an adaptation to changing UV levels, but psychologically, our history has made it important.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Yeah your right but I think it's simpler than that I think \textbf{racism} comes from a lack of understanding between people of different ethnicities for example if you have grown up only around white people and then all of a sudden meet someone with a different skin tone, you are probably going to think they are different even though they aren't different other than the tone of there skin (which in no way defines you) but yeah I think if we teach people and more importantly interact with all ethnicities and show the next generation that we are no different than we will eradicate it. But even as an adult just interacting with others can subdue those thoughts people have. And also I think that the media needs to downplay and not put pressure on non \textbf{racist} people because you have to be very PC and it makes you think too much around people you don't know purely because you don't want to offend them once those pressure are removed \textbf{racism} will go and people can truly co-exist\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/178 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.685 \\  \hline

This will become more apparent as she ages, since some of these features become more apparent with \textbf{age}. These non-white features are also more than skin deep... It is in fact very easy to determine a person's \textbf{race} simply from a skull. White, \textbf{Black}, American Indians and Asian skulls have key features that are easily distinguishable from one another. Forensic investigators use these features all the time to determine the \textbf{race} of a victim when all they find is a skull. Here are some of the features Forensic Investigators use to determine the \textbf{race} of a person from a skull:The palate and palatine suture:  The hard palate is the \textbf{bony} structure at the top of the mouth bordered by the upper teeth. In American Indians, the palate is elliptical, with the ‘U' shape angling in at the back teeth. In blacks, the palate is hyperbolic—a perfect ‘U' shape with straight lines. And in whites, the palate is parabolic with the ends of the ‘U' flaring outwards. The transverse palatine suture that horizontally transects the palate also varies by \textbf{race}: It is straight in American Indians, curved in blacks, and a jagged line in whites.The nose: The nose provides multiple \textbf{race} indicators. In whites, the nasal aperture is long and narrow, with a high bridge and a sharp nasal sill (the lower edge of the nasal aperture projects sharply outwards). In blacks, the nasal aperture is short and wide with a low bridge and a guttered or trough-like nasal sill. In American Indians, the nasal aperture is medium-sized with both a medium bridge and nasal sill.Teeth: Whites tend to have smaller teeth, often with significant crowding. Blacks rarely have crowding and the upper teeth often project outwards due to the angled shape of the maxilla. American Indians have well spaced teeth but often exhibit sclerosed dentition—when calcium deposits build up inside the tooth, thinning the root canal—leaving teeth loose within the mandible and easily cracked.The shape of the incisors is also an important indicator of \textbf{race} in the teeth. In American Indians (and East Asians, both of \textbf{Mongoloid} ancestry), the incisors are shovel-shaped, named because the inner surface is scooped or curved. \textbf{Black} and whites both have blade-form incisors where the tooth has a flat profile.The mastoid process: The shape of the mastoid process differs between the races. In blacks, the \textbf{bony} projection is wide, in whites it is narrow and pointed, and in American Indians, a secondary smaller projection forms on the back surface of the mastoid process.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Black, Bony, Mongoloid, Race & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments, Physical Identity - Physical Features & \cellcolor{green!27}11/465 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.366 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small When I hear progressives talk in glowing terms about how only they seem to care about "science" and how shocked they are that "less tolerant" and "less educated" groups don't seem to care about "science", this is primarily the kind of "science" that comes to mind. The most sharp irony surrounding the whole thing is that reiterating this stance ("\textbf{race} is a social construct with no basis in reality") in turn actually fuels MORE \textbf{racism}; \textbf{gender} studies majors might be gullible enough to be duped into it but everyday people who live outside gated communities (where these "class-conscious justice warriors" almost inevitably hail from) actually work with peoples of different races and cultures every day. They can see the many differences, both physical, \textbf{mental} and emotional, between the different groups of people before them.When you confront everyday people with these sorts of narratives and present them with no alternative viewpoints, they can tell it's complete garbage but they (or at least, many) have no other ideologies to fall back on for the subject. They don't know what to believe, they just know what they're being told is a lie. As happens so tragically often with groups with no moral framework to draw on they lapse into baser human nature, which in this case takes the form of \textbf{racism}.Not everyone has the enormous capacity for self-deception that leftist intellectuals do. If one's aim is truly to reduce \textbf{racism} and promote cooperation between different groups, emphasis should be put on saying that yes, we are different, but that's no reason why we can't cooperate and get along.The fact that a group that fetishizes "diversity" to the extent that it does also desperately insists that there are no distinctions between humans of any kind (\textbf{gender} is a social construct too, or so they tell us, and \textbf{sex} is fluid and can be changed with something as simple as surgery) is just one of many conflicting ideas that progressives somehow manage to go through life without ever seeing the disconnect. The most disturbing thing about this whole thing is that this desperate need to find proof that there are no distinctions between humans implies an underlying intolerant streak itself; implicit is the idea that humans NEED to be the same, because if they are different that is wrong and disgusting, and it justifies different groups treating each other horribly and there is no hope for peaceful cooperation. If it is claimed that vocal homophobes are attempting to distract from their own innate \textbf{homosexual} tendencies, then perhaps those who speak most vehemently against "intolerance" are attempting to cover for innate intolerant tendencies in themselves.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender, Homosexual, Mental, Race, Racism, Sex & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General, Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments, Sexual Identity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}8/442 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.81 \\  \hline

As a healthcare provider, allow me to assure you that certain races are more susceptible to certain diseases independent of diet, stress, and socioeconomic standing. Look, I get it.

I also completely agree with  your sentiment that racial differences are mostly exaggerated. My only disagreement with your response was "Yah, like she said it was adapting to the environment." The host (not you) goes far beyond discussing how diseases adapt to environments, and ends up presenting potentially dangerous misinformation as a result. I'm not trying to encourage different races to focus on their differences. That has clearly led to disastrous results. However, it is important that the average person understands that the incidence of certain diseases (sickle cell being one of many) does affect one \textbf{race} more than another regardless of socioeconomics.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/115 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.87 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small a certain disease affecting one portion of the group than the other probably has to do with a change within a genetic sequence that runs within them due to the lack of adaptation to the environmental conditions. Take people that have \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} hair for example. In order for the phenotype to show that you have \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} hair, you must have the genotype on both sides of the family, most times, it's your mom and dad. This also means that every person with \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} hair all come from a person who had such a genetic mutation. When the topic of \textbf{race} is discussed, it is natural to point out the similar characteristics of one person to the other, a dark-skinned person to another dark-skinned person, \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} haired with another \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} haired, blond with another blond. That focuses more on the similarity of their genetic sequences to benefit their survival long enough to produce a fertile offspring. \textbf{Race} to scientists is not EXACTLY the same "\textbf{race}" discussed by..well, racists. It's like when you say a word to one person in a chain and you ask them to keep sending it and let the last one say the word. It's sound close but not exactly the word that you said yourself. The point is that the word \textbf{race} has been so blurred by other people's opinions and ideas of it that it naturally has lost its true meaning while also becoming more dangerous to our society than beneficial. \textbf{Race} is a thing but not the thing that everyday people usually talk about (atleast that how I understand it).\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Race, Red & \cellcolor{green!27} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Ethnicity - General, Ethnicity - Native-American & \cellcolor{green!27}15/265 & \cellcolor{green!27}5.66 \\  \hline

These people need an elementary critical thinking course. A course in the philosophy of biology wouldn't hurt either: natural kinds have \textbf{fuzzy} boundaries. If \textbf{fuzzy} boundaries and intermediate cases meant that a putative natural kind was not real, that would mean that species and sexes aren't real either. In fact, it would mean that there were no natural kinds at all. Which would make science impossible.  This is all motivated by the laudable goal of eliminating \textbf{racism}. But (a) political goals--even good ones--cannot be allowed to interfere with science, and (b) we can combat \textbf{racism} without pretending that races are fictions.  Furthermore, (c) if the only way to achieve equality were to argue that biological differences don't exist, then fighting \textbf{sexism} would mean arguing that sexes aren't natural kinds, either.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I do not know that much about dogs as I do about humans, but the situation between humans and dogs is certainly not similar. Some dogs are called purebreds for what it is worth, but there are no purebreeds in humans. We are all mixed and I can provide a lot of maps that make this clear.If by \textbf{race} people mean a mixture between culture, language, geography etc... then I appologise for talking about something else. But biologically speaking, I am not convinced that races in humans exist. I am thinking about this in a biological manner.And you need far more than "differences in DNA" in order to be considered something else otherwise there would be 7 billion human races, but there is already a word for that. It is called individuals.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/134 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.746 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small +UltraI disagree. If we assume that \textbf{race} exists in the biological context that you are denying, then, it follows that there are 'purebreds' of humans as well, similar to purebred dogs. A purebred is simply any animal who comes from parents of the same breed or variety. This implies that the term refers to a more immediate ancestral connection as opposed to tracing the lineage all the way back before this "\textbf{race}" or "breed" started to deviate and split-off from the parent breed. "And you need far more than "differences in DNA" in order to be considered something else otherwise there would be 7 billion human races, but there is already a word for that. It is called individuals"Yes, and No... but mostly NO. Again, this would just depend on how we decide to define, categorize, and divvy-up the so called races. In other words, what criteria would we be establishing in order for one group of people to qualify as a '\textbf{race}'.In my opinion, I agree that the concept and usage of "\textbf{race}" is really not something inherent or intrinsic, it is artificial... just like state boundaries within a country. However, the biological content those artificially-labeled groups represent and describe is NOT artificial and does inherently reflect reality. All we need to do is come up with a system and method to artificially categorize groups of people sharing certain heritable traits. We can select for any traits we want.... If we wanted to, we could categorize all humans who have a genetic predisposition to color blindness or Huntington's disease or 20/20 vision or w/e as their own separate "races", and the application of biological \textbf{race} would still be valid. Meaning that, if those types of people I just mentioned were to only breed with themselves, then, their offspring would likely inherit those traits and would clearly be distinct (to some degree) from other groups of people who do not carry those traits. Why does this matter? Because, If we wanted, we could easily create an artificial category and set out of \textbf{thin} air called XYZ, where all members have heritable traits a, b, c, d, e, f, g, 1, 2, 3.... AND are also exclusive to geography XYZ and lineage ZYX. So, by definition, \textbf{race} XYZ exists because the set XYZ exists because the elements/members of set XYZ exists, and only partially overlaps with set \textbf{ABC} (some other random group of people).  Prime example, take the apparent fact that sub-Saharan Africans are the only humans that virtually have \textbf{ZERO} Neanderthal DNA. If a biologist wanted to identify entire groups of people with respect to the Neanderthal genome sequence, how would they classify sub-Saharan Africans as a whole? (rhetorical question). Again, the category of \textbf{race} just depends on what traits you (the scientist) are interested in identifying.... and, ultimately boils-down to how useful those categories are and why someone might want to use them (like medical \textbf{doctors}, perhaps). Like you said, if you wanted to, you could micro-manage to the extreme and just classify every individual human being as their own separate \textbf{race}, but.... how useful is that?\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}ABC, Race, Thin, Zero, doctors & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - General, Nationality - Chinese, Nationality - General, Physical Identity - Physical Features & \cellcolor{green!27}11/521 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.111 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small +Taylor ShobeOkay, then maybe I should have said that it is not a scientific fact. I understand what you mean.What I mean with \textbf{race} is not scientific is that it does not objectively exist. For example, we can say that we can group people together in races based on a random set of characteristics that are used at a given moment but you cannot come to the conclusion that human races do objectively and intrinsically exist.Categorizing animals into different species has some natural meaning since different species cannot mate with each other and since the differences between species should be more significant than the individual differences. Just like how all elephants are equally different from all ducks. The problem with humans is that you can have either more genetic material that is being associated with one \textbf{race} or genetic material that is more associated with another \textbf{race} eventhough either way you are still much closer to your parents than to other people from either races. This can not happen with different species.Sadly, a lot of people talk about \textbf{race} as if it has intrinsic meaning and they think that they can easily make a conclusion that it exists while in biology it can take months, years or decades before it is agreed upon something.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Race & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}4/218 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.835 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small +UltrafalkenUnderstood.Personally, I would take it one step further and say that even the term 'species' does not objectively exist either, even though the concrete set biological characteristics which differentiate one species from another DOES objectively exist. To copy your own phrasing:"For example, we can say that we can group people together in races based on a random set of characteristics that are used at a given moment but you cannot come to the conclusion that human races do objectively and intrinsically exist"I believe this same logic applies to the concept of 'species' as well. The genes and DNA sequences which enable the concept of 'species' to be true and accurate is just another way to group animals together with respect to some arbitrary traits. The observable effect is just more profound and recognizable, perhaps. From a raw logic perspective, I believe grouping animals together with respect to 'species' is ultimately just as random as grouping animals with respect to behavioral traits or bone density or whatever. Now, however, I will easily admit that grouping with respect to 'species' is probably much more A) meaningful and helpful, B) obvious and apparent, and C) easier to go about actually doing the classification itself. To demonstrate a more practical example of why even the concept of 'species' does not objectively exist either, we can just refer to documented cases of members from two different species (presumed different species) successfully breeding with one another and producing hybrid offspring (sometimes sterile offspring). This shows that even the process of speciation can still be subject to blurry lines and ill-defined parameters... if a biologist were to map out the entire genome sequence of the non-compatible parents and tried to show exactly where and why they should not be able to produce offspring together. I believe I heard a science journalist on NPR sometime ago state that, technically, there is \textbf{nothing} inherently ALWAYS preventing one species from breeding with another (within the same genus, family, or order?? IDK), its just comes down to a matter of probability, and that (generally) it is extremely improbable for different species to be able to breed with one another. That makes complete sense to me. This type of inter-species breeding across different taxonomic hierarchies  ranks is briefly described with the following quote from Wikipedia:"Hybrids between different sub-species within a species (such as between the Bengal tiger and Siberian tiger) are known as intra-specific hybrids. Hybrids between different species within the same genus (such as between lions and tigers) are sometimes known as inter-specific hybrids or crosses. Hybrids between different genera (such as between sheep and goats) are known as inter-generic hybrids. Extremely rare inter-familial hybrids have been known to occur (such as the guineafowl hybrids).[4] No inter-ordinal (between different orders) animal hybrids are known."Bottom Line: If you deny that any human races can objectively exist, then you must also deny that any animal species objectively exist as well (regardless of how useful or meaningful it might be to employ such classification).\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}1/507 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.197 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Taylor ShobeAccording to science journalist, whether or not two individuals from different "species" still have a small or very small, depending what you consider small or very small, chance of producing offsprings. So if you try to make a million individuals breed with a million of other individuals from a different "specie" then in theory you should have some hybrids?I do agree that some different species have to be considered the same specie then.What I am trying to say about ducks and elephants is that ducks are not so individually variable from each other that some of them will be closer to elephants than to some ducks just like how there are no elephants that are closer to some ducks than they are to other elephants. There are evolutionary on different branches. Maybe their \textbf{common} ancestors could have been so close to each other that they would overlap since they were on the same branch but with elephants and ducks you are not going to have false negatives or false positives. The ancestors of the elephant and birds who belonged to the same branch of the evolutionary tree and who would have overlapped with each other are not alive now. You are not going to have ducks that overlap with elephants since they are not variable enough or evolutionary close to each other.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Common & \cellcolor{green!27}Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}1/226 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.442 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Right, I believe so. That's why the 'hybrid' phenomena seems to stop at "Family" in the taxonomic tree. There are no known cases of inter-ordinal hybrids existing, and the cases for inter-familial hybrids are still extremely rare. Again, I'm not sure where the probabilistic valuation becomes \textbf{zero} and 'impossible', but it looks like somewhere around the 'order' or perhaps even 'class' stage. My apologies if I misspoke earlier, as, clearly, the possibility of hybridization should not span the entire gamut of taxonomic hierarchy.

Purity can be considered being homozygous for alleles. This is accomplished through inbreeding. Unfortunately, being homozygous is not always a good thing. For example, being homozygous for the allele for sickle-cell can kill you. Being homozygous for other alleles can cause birth defects. As a buffer for these recessive traits we are discouraged from purity, because being heterozygous can still protect you from a debilitating condition.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small "Well, which one is it?" Back when I was in 6th grade , I was reading the biology school book, there were two articles regarding \textbf{race} and \textbf{ethnicity}. The first one was rather more biology leaning, where it said that there are differences between races such as some features like the wider noses and lips of some \textbf{african} \textbf{ethnic} groups which helped them dissipate heat. The 2nd one, which rather sociological, stated that there were no differences between races and that all ppl are basically the same. I remember feeling some what the same, wondering, which one is it and how many ppl have written these two articles. :P I mean, if they meant that you shouldn't discriminate of ppl solely based on their \textbf{race}, bcs personality isn't solely determined by your \textbf{ethnicity} or something like that, but nope. They couldn't bother or were unable to elaborate and formulate that like that, so every one would get it, instead they just left two self-conflicting statements like that. I wonder whether this isn't being done on purpose, who knows. :P Here in this one video we have the same two self-conflicting statements that I have read in a biology school book in the mid-late 90's in Bulgaria. Given that eastern Europe isn't really that much PC and SJW at all, we ain't vile racists like some certain outlets have portrayed us, but certainly not anywhere how things are in western europe neither. :P But how comes that the very same paradox is still present, I guess the source was the same for both this video and the school book I was reading. :P It's however retarded statement the way it is presented, she never says anything like a concept where "there are racial/ethnical differences, but they doesn't really matter when it comes to personalities" and shit like that, nope. She just yaps some rather ideology based absolute bullshit which in the end doesn't even make any logical sense, as she contradicts herself.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}African, Ethnic, Ethnicity, Race & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}6/331 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.813 \\  \hline

WRONG! Thing is, everyone can draw very subjective impressions from that video, bcs she never elaborates that, as I've mentioned, she makes very poor and foggy arguments that aren't really well factually and scientifically, nor logically for that matter, supported. You can't say "there are no racial differences", yet then come and say that "racial diversity is good for your health", the 2nd statement cannot be true, if the first statement is invalid. And clines aren't racial traits, they are traits that you will/may get regardless of your \textbf{ethnicity}. "And the scientific consensus about \textbf{race} is that it does not exists and if the scientific consensus about \textbf{race} is that it does not exist then it may be better to agree with it." Or what, you will send him to the wrongthink re-education camps? :P Science (rather scientific consensuses) have been wrong about a lot of things, especially regarding \textbf{ethnic} and cultural topics. For example, like the concept of Bulgars and modern day bulgarians being Turkic, Turks and that Bulgars and modern Bulgarians had \textbf{nothing} ethnically linking them, which a recent study smashed into pieces. And the scientific consensus was corrected regarding this primer. This is just one example. You have others, like Galileo. Anyone with even half a brain can see why it may be a good idea to "agree with it", but it's a stark example why ideologically and influence/politically driven science isn't a good thing, quite the opposite. And another very funny fact for your amusement, mainstream science have labeled phrenology as a pseudo science, yet, there are many examples where mainstream science uses pretty much the same approaches. Forensic science can easily tell you the \textbf{ethnicity}/\textbf{race} of a person solely y looking at their skeleton. Just watch some Bones. :P But if you actually want to be sure this isn't just some entertainment mumbo jumbo, altho the show and series were created by a forensic expert, go research on your own and watch some documentaries on the subject too. Another rather more related to phrenology example is this article about a presumably more intelligent extinct human specie.  [LINK] The claim was made not solely due to their cranial size, but bcs they had a larger front lobe, which would presumably mean that they were potentially more intelligent. Why, you may ask. Bcs higher intellectual capacity has been linked with larger front brain lobe. :P Now this sounds awfully similar and conforming with Phrenology. Those fucking scientific racists. xO "Phrenology (from Greek φρήν (phrēn), meaning 'mind', and λόγος (logos), meaning 'knowledge') is a pseudomedicine primarily focused on measurements of the human skull, based on the concept that the brain is the organ of the mind, and that certain brain areas have localized, specific functions or modules." "Although both of those ideas have a basis in reality, phrenology extrapolated beyond empirical knowledge in a way that departed from science. " "In general, instruments to measure sizes of cranium continued to be used after the mainstream phrenology had ended. " Now, I'm neither for, nor against phrenology. I actually still can't comprehend it entirely, I haven't put the time and effort to do so. Basically, I don't give two shits about phrenology. But from pure logic, I can assume it got some stuff wrong, which isn't anything exceptional, given how this have happened with every aspect in science, including medicine. But apparently, it also got some things right, given that many of these approaches and instruments are still used today. :P The \textbf{race} debate here feels very similar with that.

"That's what was meant in this video, say nazis succeeded in killing al non-Ariërs, genetic difference between those people would be relatively low, as their forefathers have lived on same places for dozens of generations." And we are back at the \textbf{nazi} debate, Godwin's law was correct after all. :P \textbf{Nazi}'s ideology was as retarded as any other similar ideology, they didn't base their shit on actual proven science to begin with. But your claim is as fallacious as the \textbf{nazi}'s ideological propaganda itself. First, you have to define what meant Aryan according to the \textbf{nazi} ideology. Hitler himself wasn't exactly aryan, they had non-aryan soldiers and allies. So your whole concept is flawed from birth, you obviously haven't studied as much as you would like to think you have. \textbf{Nazi}'s ideology was not to exterminate every non-white person on earth, in fact, they considered many other white nations are untermensch too, like the poles of which they killed more than a million. Those are the strictly non-jewish ones alone, they also killed millions of jewish ones. Their ideology was centered around the concept of living spaces, which they apparently claimed that german population needed in order to survive, which is why they needed justification for invading Poland (mutually with the Soviets from the other side). They wanted to kill anyone non-germanic and only in contesting territory. But let's accept that they wanted to do what you claimed, it still wouldn't help your other argument. A german would have different genes compared to a \textbf{indian}, and this goes for any other diverting two \textbf{ethnic} groups. A pole is genetically different from a lebanese, an irish person is genetically different from a malaysian person. That is not to say that they are different humans, but they are to say the least bearing some very distinct genetic features. You are still unconvinced, well then, grab 1 person from let's say Bulgaria who is also with bulgarian \textbf{ethnicity} and 1 person from Australia who is from australian \textbf{ethnic} background. Would you feel equally safe about giving them analgin pill for pain relief for both of them? If your answer is yes, then I highly suggest you go and find the reason why you are wrong, before you've killed s/o (australian). :P "Looks like someone didn't pay attention during his biology classes.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Humans will definitely react, maybe even overreact, to people of different \textbf{ethnicity} if they are different from what's normally seen. More precisely, we react that way to almost anything that's unusual or abnormal. Why? Because when we were evolving to what we are today, most abnormalities probably had a high chance of threatening our survival. Unfortunately, this trait causes us to react in certain ways that aren't in our best interests anymore.I remember the story my Grandmother told me about when she first saw a man of \textbf{African} descent. She was only about 5 years \textbf{old} or so and had only seen people of European decent. As soon as she saw that man she screamed out something along the lines of "Mommy! Mommy! Look! It's a man made of chocolate!!!" Although she didn't react badly, it was still quite an overreaction.

And maybe these differences are small but they do exist, and if we recognize that and the right of all people to be free, and the right of people to control their own communities, the right of people to control and even create and have nations that reflect their own individual identity and expression; if we teach people to do that and at the same time trying to work out agreements without war, hatred and violence with others, the world is going to be a lot better place to live in and we're going to have a lot fewer conflicts because most of the conflicts in this planet come from this area.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnic & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/199 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.503 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small For me \textbf{racism} and oppression are wrong as a matter of principle, not as a matter of science. Science doesn't tell us to hurt other people (it's a matter of principle that does that). Certainly, it's not hard to see that some of the understanding of \textbf{race} can give ammunition to those people who are \textbf{racist} in a real sense, who want to exploit others, who will justify hurting others or imperialism (in a sense). And also understanding of \textbf{race} DOESN'T give ammunition in other ways because the truth is that all human beings share a lot of the same genes. And the idea that there are different \textbf{ethnic} groups, racial groups, genetic heritages; this is a natural principle, this is a principle of nature, it's a principle of science, it exists throughout the animal kingdom and it exists throughout humanity. And so, \textbf{race} and these differences are a natural thing, it's not an unnatural thing. But it's strange how people will praise diversity but at the same time they want to destroy diversity with their globalism, isn't it? This video is saying that racial divisions don't even exist and yet every aspect of science proves it exists; they exist even in the way we treat medical conditions (diseases). We literally understand and realize that racial groups react to medicines differently, therapies differently, that they have higher rises for certain kinds of diseases. \textbf{Race} is reality on the planet, and it's not \textbf{racism} to admit this reality. \textbf{Racism}, as defined by the dictionaries today is the idea of hating other people or believing other people are inferior to yourselves. It's a very negative term; it's not defined today simply \textbf{race}-ism which would simply be to believe in \textbf{race}; it's defined today in a hateful way. And I often hear the term "human \textbf{race}". Actually, "human \textbf{race}" is completely inaccurate from a scientific point of view because \textbf{race} basically in science vernacular is considered subspecies, it's not considered species. And so people say the "human \textbf{race}" kind of making us all like the same \textbf{race}. Actually, there's not only one human \textbf{race} there are human races, and these races have different characteristics, not only skin color and hair texture but also literally the shape of the scull, the shape (for instance) of the pelvis and different all sorts of tendencies.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnic, Race, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}15/389 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.856 \\  \hline

Here they have the scientific and true rundown of the concept of \textbf{race}, and all some people can do is cry about how some people are different than others.  Newsflash..WE ARE ALL DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER.  But you can have more in \textbf{common} with someone of a different skin color than even people you associate with being in the same "\textbf{race}" as you.  This is the truth, people.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Austin Pinheiro Let me deconstruct your argument point-by-point. Just be glad I'm not criticizing your horrendous spelling.1) That study has been debunked over and over and over again. \textbf{Nobody} with any medical background treats it as anything more than an urban myth, which is exactly what it is.2) Yes, humans are 98 genetically identical to the most similar living species (chimpanzees), and further all humans share almost 100 of their DNA. You want a cookie? Of course all this is true. But it may also interest you to know that mammals are similar genetically, and in fact humans are 92 genetically identical to mice, yet humans don't really look much like mice now do we? Further, we're 44 identical to \textbf{fruit} flies, 26 identical to yeast, and 18 identical to the weed Thale Cress. To answer your question, yes, I am saying that a tiny percent of your genetic code can make that big of a difference. Some very major genetic diseases in humans are the result of a single base pair change out of literally billions of base pairs in the human genome. So while 0.00001 difference may not look like much to the average joe, it's a massive difference in terms of genetics.3) A few thousand years? Buddy, try 40,000 years. Do you know how many new species can be created in 40 thousand years? Honestly, it's a wonder that humans didn't speciate completely, as we almost certainly would have if we had not been so intelligent and made contact with other geographically isolated civilizations.4) Ignoring your use of the wrong "your", explain to me exactly how I am sounding like an ableist? \textbf{Ableism} has \textbf{nothing} to do with what we are talking about in the slightest. Further, the concept of "\textbf{ableism}" is inherently idiotic, as your definition of "\textbf{ableism}" would have it that the process of evolution by natural selection is "ableist".

Just look at dogs , the more pure bred they are the bigger the vet bill . I live in a community where there is a large population of religious dutch who would disown their children for marrying a mate who isn't not only dutch but goes to the same claim to be Christian church , and the large number of children born with down's syndrome , and cerebral palsy in their \textbf{racist} hateful look down on everybody else closed community is more than obvious . With any luck they will all inbreed them selves out of existence , one thing I have learned in life is that without religion there would be way more tolerance and acceptance in our world , infact i would say that hate and \textbf{racism} are fully derived from Supposed Christianity . I have read the bible and nowhere in it does it say that being a Christian means taking over or subjugating your fellow man , infact it say's to love your neighbor as yourself and to love the lord with all your heart . But since all modern Christian groups came out of the Roman Catholic church who over a 1200 year period between the fall of Rome and the French revolution murdered more people than any other group in history , a huge part of Christian ideology was planted by the Catholic Church and has no basis in the bible . Now whether or not we believe in god or in whatever other theory we believe ,most of what is wrong with the overall human condition can be traced back to religious ideology . Some of the richest people on the planet are Christians who stepped on their fellow man in order to further their own ends , who lied cheated and stole , but tell themselves and each other that their wealth is a blessing from god because they belong to (insert any one of the 30 plus religious groups here) . The only reason that we have more than one Christian groups just shows that most of what they believe is all made up , because they can't even agree on one god and one version of right and wrong or what reason to go to war and kill your neighbor . If there is a God , he doesn't give out different rules and regulations , based on \textbf{race} or any other of the reasons we give for being a \textbf{race} of hateful selfish humans . If you believe in the bible and god , than you have to except that in the beginning there was only one man and one \textbf{woman} that all people descend from Adam and thus we are all brothers and sisters that should really learn to get along . Strangely it is my experience that atheists are more likely to love their fellow man , more than so called Christians do , I say So Called christian so many times because I hope in doing so at least a few people will come to understand that Christ's message was one of peace and understanding , of caring for whoever needs your care , not just the members of your own church , \textbf{race} , or family , if you claim to be a Christian I beg you to please read the bible for yourself , instead of just listening to your leaders , because they have been lying to you just like their leaders lied to them .\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Race, Racism, Racist, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}6/669 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.897 \\  \hline

" Eh, allow me, a fucking white male to mansplain you for a moment. Whether you are convinced or not, that shouldn't matter when you are talking about science. Science should rely on facts and scientific evidence, not on convincing ppl. That is called propaganda. And confirmation bias. I know I am a single man, but I can certainly tell you that I've never had that concept that a \textbf{woman}'s opinion should be disregarded, just bcs she \textbf{woman}. It's nonsensical. It's however laughable how hypocritical you are. You are accusing a whole \textbf{gender} of bias, while yourself showing \textbf{gender} bias yourself, and not only towards men, but women too.

We should be like the girl version of the dudebros. xD I don't understand where did you got your notion that a \textbf{woman} would generally share the same ideology as another women, simply bcs they are two women. And the same about men too. There are plenty of men who are feminists for example, while there are plenty of women who dislikes the feminist ideology, further more there are the intersectional feminists, who both are feminists, but can disagree on many other levels regarding their ideology. And before you ask me what do I have against females being equal with men, I have \textbf{nothing} against, quite the opposite. But if I ad to define myself I would describe myself as an egalitarian rather than a feminist. For which I have many reasons. I can't see any relative reasoning how \textbf{gender} is related to this whole topic, but I guess I will get an answer similar to the one posted here by another user. "Genetic diversity is good for us.""There are no real differences between races. We are just the human \textbf{race}.

That gives time for a lot of divergence.That is why NOW we are more like "\textbf{black}" people and "Asian" people genetically." One have to laugh at that at best. xD First off, Neanderthals didn't split up, modern homo sapiens still bear neanderthal dna. If they were extinct, they shouldn't have any dna in modern humans. And yes, humans share dna with monkeys, but we also share dna with potatoes, so. The thing is, that you are claiming they are simply not human, but separate species. But you are wrong, they are part of the hominid. They are homo. x) And besides, the out of Africa theory might be widely accepted, but it isn't widely supported by scientific evidence to the point that it is not arguable.  [LINK] 1 simple fact is, that for the many cave drawings found around Europe where neanderthals were mostly found, scientists can't say for sure whether they were made by neanderthals or homo sapiens. So, at beat you can speculate whether neanderthals and homo sapiens didn't mixed up and the former population melted into the latter one. But that is if the out of Africa theory is really what happened. There is also the possibility that the Neanderthals simply evolved, as did the Denisovans. Which were mostly found around Asia. The whole notion that a single group would colonize the whole world is kinda unrealistic. :P And there have been ever growing evidence against the out of Africa theory.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@ 2:25 \textbf{Racism} IS a learned behavior.  People learn not to trust other "races" by 1) what they hear and 2) what they experience.  If what they hear is reinforced by what they experience then they don't trust that "\textbf{race}".  If what they hear is contradicted by what they experience then slowly trust is gained or lost depending on the situation.  It's really very simple.  Now the question is why is there so much \textbf{racism} in America these days when tolerance is promoted and \textbf{racist} attitudes are shunned.  Well, let's look at \textbf{racism} against \textbf{black} people.  White children are taught in school that everyone is good and should be treated with respect, but then these children grow up and look around them and see the truth.  They see the \textbf{racism} and the double standards and it isn't coming from the whites.  They know that there are parts of the city where they do not go alone or at night because they will become an unnamed statistic.  They also see that if the situation is reversed - a \textbf{black} kid mugged, beaten, or killed in a white neighborhood will make the news.  The white kids, no matter what background they come from, see that if there is a benefit or a cut-in-line being handed out it's probably not going to them.  They see groups which they are excluded from due to skin color which if the situation was reversed would be shut down in a second.  They see behavior being applauded that if they were to engage in would be looked down upon.  And the thing that makes these once tolerant, accepting children into untrusting, "\textbf{racist}" adults is they don't see this situation being rectified.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Race, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}9/284 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.169 \\  \hline

I was also referring to grouping of genetic traits.Second, let me say that your all caps section reflects misunderstanding. From genetics home refrence ( [LINK] "Like most aspects of human behavior and cognition, intelligence is a complex trait that is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors."It's frankly ridiculous to think genetics plays no part in intelligence. Have you met anyone with Downs Syndrom? That is one of many genetic conditions that can negatively impact intelligence.If what you mean to say is that the genetic factors that impact intelligence do not vary significantly between races compared to within them, then I would have to agree. But what you did say... well "proof" is not a real thing that happens in science. That happens in law and math. But there is some strong evidence.The IQ test does not measure general intelligence very well, it only works under very specific circumstances."Can you at least agree that as of today, anyone on this planet can be of peak human health \& intelligence given the proper environment, nurturing, and sustenance now that geographical barriers are moot and access to knowledge is relatively ubiquitous."No. Not at all. Again, genetic diseases significantly impact people. I have a friend with a pretty bad genetic disease and she cannot be healthy unless some new treatment is discovered. Downs syndrom again, not very treatable. Autism is also very hard to treat and has hundreds of identified genetic factors that can contribute. You didn't even mention treatment of diseases in what I quoted above.I suspect you didn't think through what you said very well. If you respond again I will be happy to discuss some more. I suggest that you be careful to specifically say "\textbf{race}" when you are talking about \textbf{race}, as many things you said might have been referring to some aspect of \textbf{race}, but you may have inadvertently used much broader terms.Also, I may not have been clear on some things I said in my post, it seem it may have lead to some misunderstanding. Based on how much you describe genetics and intelligence, maybe you thought I was implying that some races are genetically more intelligent than others. I did not mean to imply that, but it is a possibility. Currently the genetic research and the measures of intelligence are not good enough to really tell, so it may be, but then maybe not.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Race & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/412 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.728 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small It's amusing how she speaks about "There's only one \textbf{race}", and later she says "Genetic diversity". Science classifies diversity, this diversity is called ecotypes. Now, notice how she argues that "Lower genetic diversity" (meaning that humans should mix in order to prevent inbreeding) is the result of a particular human population (let's say Japanese) extending itself based on its own stock; but if we all mixed (in order to mix, there needs to exist genetic differences) "That would be good for us, it leads to robust and healthy offspring". But she's contradicting herself, because if we mix, we will all become one \textbf{race}, and as a consequence (according to her logic), we will "Have a population of inbred that will also inherit a slew of genetic ailments associated with inbreeding". We are all from the same species, but we have different races.

If you think yourself superior then you still know \textbf{nothing} and you will cause self-inflicted suffering because you will find yourself alone. The reason is the feeling of supremacy runs deeper than \textbf{race}, it has deep roots in your psychology and you are more likely to suffer from \textbf{mental} disorders like NPD.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Social \textbf{race} and Biological \textbf{race} is different, that's what she may have implied. No one \textbf{race} is biologically more intelligent than another and much of our evolutionary divergence across continents has changed very slightly. This is because we have a wide gene pool, unlike with other species, even the considerably dumber humans can pass their genes on.That doesn't mean \textbf{race} doesn't exist, don't get me wrong, the way we interrupt is just social. \textbf{Black} people per say are not a \textbf{race}, nor are whites or Asians. Different \textbf{ethnic} groups exist within different geological locations. You could argue that Mediterranean people (Italians, etc) are a different \textbf{race} from Nordic people. The same way you could argue that San people are different from Bantu people in Africa. Or that Japanese people are ethnically different than Han Chinese. You could classify everyone as a single \textbf{race} or say that there are over hundreds of races and each statement would be just as correct as another.You could call Asians white and you'd be correct, because East and Northeastern Asians lack no more melanin levels than any European \textbf{race}. You could call Russians Asians because they are in North Asia. Or Turks European because they exist within Europe. One could argue that dogs are a good representation of human races, when in fact they aren't. Dogs breeds are specifically bred to carry out and preform specific tasks or express certain characteristics. Humans have only been slightly physically changed, most genes that determine \textbf{race} are genes that are located in the Mitochondria, besides form that, humans are almost always genetically identical. All across the world only about 70 out of a million genes between different \textbf{ethnic} groups exist and those are largely useless mutations or responsible for hair, color, texture and minor features (more arm hair in Eurasians).Again, I'm not saying that \textbf{race} doesn't exist, but it's not the \textbf{race} that we socially see.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Ethnic, Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}14/321 & \cellcolor{green!5}4.361 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small from redice [LINK] Dnews begins their video by claiming that there is no biological basis for racial classification. Instead, according to Dnews, \textbf{race} is a cultural construct. This claim is strongly contradicted by the relevant scientific facts. Consider, for example, (Rosenberg et al. 2002) which found that researchers could correctly predict someone's \textbf{race} by looking at their genome nearly 100 of the time. In fact, (Tang et al. 2005) showed that even when looking at people from the United States, a country with a long history of \textbf{race} mixing, researchers can still correctly identify someones \textbf{race} based on genetic analysis alone 98.7 of the time. Furthermore, as demonstrated by (Witherspoon et al. 2007), members of the same \textbf{race} are almost always more genetically similar than members of different races. And the biology of \textbf{race} is not limited to genes. For instance, as noted in (Sesardic 2010), researchers have been able to correctly identify someone's \textbf{race} by analyzing their skeletons for decades.Dnews also attempts to cast doubt on the idea that there are significant genetic differences between people by noting that all humans share 99.9 of their genetic code with one another. In other words, humans, on average, are genetically identical except for 1 in 1,000 base pairs. This is true, but Dnew's interpretation of this statistic is misleading. According to Dnew's own source, there are around 3 billion base pairs in the human genome and so differing at a rate of 1 per 1,000 base pairs means that humans, on average, differ by 3 million base pairs. To put this in perspective, a difference of a single base pair can cause significant differences between people. For instance, the genetic disease sickle cell anemia is caused by a mutation in a single base pair. Consider further that (Polderman et al. 2015) combined decades worth of data on 14.5 million twins and found that, on average, about half of the differences between people were caused by genetic differences between them. (Bouchard 2004) found similar estimates when examining the behavioral genetic literature on psychological differences between people. Clearly then, there are genetic differences between people and they have very significant effects.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Race & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}7/359 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.95 \\  \hline

It particularly annoys me when she/DNews says "okay, so we've established that \textbf{race} as a scientific concept does not exist."  No, you haven't ESTABLISHED it, you've CLAIMED it. And the fact that she cites Robert Sussman's book doesn't change that. Sussman's book is not definitive, and there are many who disagree with him. Oh, by the way, she says that "there is genetic variation in and between populations, but it is quite small, and the most amount of genetic variation found within our species isn't between those of European and \textbf{African} ancestry; it's between various populations within Africa." That's an argument known as "Lewontin's Fallacy." Look it up. Furthermore, its originator, Richard Lewontin, has been thought to be politically motivated. I'm sure he is, and she is, too.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African, Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/147 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.361 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@MT35 But several studies have shown that the genetic variation is actually so small, that it is really meaningless to classify \textbf{race}, and superficial traits depends only on few genes, that's hardly enough, and genetically we all have the same genes, som populations just have certain genes that are turned on and others off. So to see so many dislikes, just get me thinking that people want \textbf{race} to exist, which I find sad because so many doesn't understand the science behind it...\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Race & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/83 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.41 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Son Ly You're pretty much repeating Lewontin's Fallacy yourself now. The fact that genetic variation is small doesn't make it meaningless, at all. If I can tell who is white, who is \textbf{black}, and who is Asian, guess what? \textbf{Race} exists. It doesn't matter how few genes caused it. And, by the way, Richard Dawkins, for example, one of the world's foremost evolutionary biologists, believes in \textbf{race}. So does James Watson, based on his controversial comments. I guess they just don't understand the science behind it? Lastly, I don't, like many others here I'm sure, particularly "want" \textbf{race} to exist or not exist. I just know that it DOES.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}4/109 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.67 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@MT35 But again the variations is very small, and there's really no specific genetic marker for certain races.  Yes they believe in \textbf{race} but that's a matter of perspective of how you look at it, but in terms of biology the variations is not enough to classify a \textbf{race}, we all have the same genes, there's no \textbf{african} gene, white gene or asian gene, and yes \textbf{race} exist but as a social construct\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}African, Race & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}4/73 & \cellcolor{green!27}5.479 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Son Ly But it doesn't MATTER that the variations are very small. The genetic variation between humans and chimpanzees is relatively small as well, but there is clearly a huge difference between humans and chimpanzees. The variation between breeds of dogs is very small, but there are clearly different breeds of dogs. As for people like Dawkins and Watson and others, no, it is not a matter of how you look at it -- they believe in \textbf{race} as a BIOLOGICAL reality, and I doubt they would be happy with you misrepresenting their position. YOU may believe that it's only a social construct, but they don't. And my point was that I find it doubtful that these people just don't "understand the science behind it." And, by the way, your claim that "we all have the same genes" is categorically false. If that were true, people wouldn't be able to figure out someone's \textbf{race} from their DNA, but we can. Hey, Son Ly, I had asked this below, but I'll ask you personally now. What's your take on the Rachel Dolezal story? If \textbf{race} is really just a "social construct," weren't her claims of being a \textbf{black} \textbf{woman} completely legitimate? If you believe, though (as do most), that what she did was wrong because she isn't really \textbf{black}, then \textbf{race} must be biologically-based. You can't have it both ways.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Race, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}7/229 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.057 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Son Ly You know what? Rather than explain it to you, why don't you read fark0's (a molecular geneticist lecturer) comments above. I think he explains it pretty clearly. And I think it's pretty disingenuous to say that \textbf{race} as a social construct is "how the rest of the scientific community sees it." Some do, and many don't. And many who believe that \textbf{race} is real is punished for it in one way or another (including the aforementioned James Watson). If a scientist says that \textbf{race} is a social construct, maybe that's because he/she doesn't want to lose his/her job. By the way, Son Ly, I'm looking at the Youtube videos you like, and I see things like "teens react to Caitlyn Jenner," "kids react to \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} marriage ruling," "science says there are more than two genders," and that you're subscribed to the Young Turks channel.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Son Ly  You persist in saying that you are just "stating what the science says," when that is a pure lie. MANY scientists have most certainly NOT said that. I gave you two prominent examples of Richard Dawkins and James Watson, and you basically say that they don't count! And there are many others. Henry Harpending is another example that quickly comes to mind. Perhaps your evolutionary biology professor is on the other side, but your professor does not speak for the entire scientific community. And, really, taking a course in evolutionary biology does not qualify you an expert on this subject. Furthermore, given your taste in videos, I highly doubt that your personal views are of no influence here. I haven't come up with a valid argument that \textbf{race} exists? Honestly, I wouldn't even know where to begin, as it's so obvious. Regional variation exists in every other species -- I'm not sure why you think humans are an exception. And, quite frankly, if I can tell someone's \textbf{race} by looking at him/her, there must be group biological differences. Sure, there are people who are of mixed \textbf{race} and therefore ambiguous, but that doesn't disprove \textbf{race} any more than a mutt disproves pure breeds of dogs. Other than that, I will refer you again to fark0's comments above, as he/she is a lecturer on the subject, not just a student like you.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Race & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}4/233 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.717 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@MT35 First, I never said that I'm an expert on this subject, of course it's more complicated, I'm just telling you what have learned and read, all studies shows that the differences is pretty small, is that really enough to classify \textbf{race}?, and I think using dog as an example is bad, since they have been selectively breed for specific purposes, and the biological differences is big. For humans the differences is so small, that is only superficial, no \textbf{race} is superior og inferior to each other.But okay I saw the video and read the articles, so I agree that \textbf{race} certainly exist and Dnews is wrong and is political motivated, but we are all still humans though, but let's say hypothetically if an \textbf{alien} came to earth to study humans, would that \textbf{alien} put us into different races or just think we all look alike?And last, just because I'm an open minded person that think every human should have equal rights and be treated equaly, you don't think that I'm not capable of having an objective view on things?\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Alien, Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}5/182 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.747 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Son Ly Okay. Let's take things one at a time.You say "all studies shows that the differences is pretty small, is that really enough to classify \textbf{race}?" Again, all studies do NOT show that, or at least that's misleading. "Pretty small" when it comes to genetics can still be fairly significant, and, yes, enough to classify \textbf{race}. Then, "I think using dog as an example is bad, since they have been selectively breed for specific purposes." I hear this a lot, but I don't get it. So what? Traits are only inherited if certain members of a species are purposely bred? The different races weren't purposely bred, but thousands of years of isolation (before modern times) have had the same effect. What's the difference if its intentional or just a matter of circumstance? When like "breeds" with like, certain characteristics are going to take hold. That is, if certain traits are genetic, it shouldn't make a difference if the breeding that led to them was intentional or not. Then "For humans the differences is so small, that is only superficial, no \textbf{race} is superior og inferior to each other." Again, small can still be significant, and you don't know that they're only superficial. What you're basically saying here is "there can be physical differences between the races, but not when it comes to the brain." If other physical characteristics can be different, I don't see why the brain should be exempt. As for no \textbf{race} being superior or inferior, there we pretty much agree, but that doesn't make us all the same, including when it comes to certain characteristics. Then "But okay I saw the video and read the articles, so I agree that \textbf{race} certainly exist and Dnews is wrong and is political motivated, but we are all still humans though, but let's say hypothetically if an \textbf{alien} came to earth to study humans, would that \textbf{alien} put us into different races or just think we all look alike?" So now you're agreeing? Good, but that answers your original question of why there are so many dislikes to this video. People don't like being lied to. And to answer your question about aliens, if they are at all perceptive, yes, I think they would see the variations in our species just like we see the variations in others. Finally, "And last, just because I'm an open minded person that think every human should have equal rights and be treated equaly, you don't think that I'm not capable of having an objective view on things?" Arguing for equal rights is a completely different argument. But it is pretty clear that liberalism has had an influence on science, so when I see someone who appears to be a liberal and then claims that we're all the same (which is the founding principle of liberalism -- "all men are created equal"), as you had been doing, yes, I have to think that there is some bias there.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Alien, Race & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}7/496 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.411 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Yes I do now agree that \textbf{race} is real, but those studies from the video you referred to still says that the differences is modest, so I do feel a bit ambivalent about it, but that's irrelevant, and to the last part I just think that everyone should have equal rights and be treated equally, but I certainly do not think that everyone is created equally, some are better than others and this apply for all races\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/77 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.299 \\  \hline

The simple fact is that isolated populations have tell tale genetic markers. We can even track ancient migrations based on genetic data.  As for we modern humans, as we mix, our genes may even betray our appearance.  But this doesn't prove that \textbf{race} is solely a "social construct". Of course raising our kids not to hate is a good idea.  But telling them that there's no such thing as \textbf{race} betrays human intuition.

Doesn't mean that White peoplewere stupid, it just means their access to mainstream education and such waslimited or distanced by their situation. Why did Rome become masters of theworld? Because they managed to steal the naval secrets of the Carthaginians-who had a much more advanced culture than them at the time.

Just as modern western society or rather modern society as a whole is built upon a desire to advance, this desire first spawned from the first basic need to survive in harsher environments. The early humans lived a nomadic lifestyle in Africa, and never needed to settle down; game for food was \textbf{common} and the plains, deserts and grasslands of Africa were fairly easy to traverse. Once humans went global, spreading to more hostile parts of the world; different cultures came into being as people needed to learn new ways to adapt to their respective locations. Tools were crafted to hunt and better traverse certain landscapes, warmer clothing was developed to shield from colder weather. A nomadic lifestyle was no longer feasible for some of these groups due to the terrain or climate, so they settled. Agriculture was developed, and is one of the main reasons we have large cities today. The need to hunt and move was no longer there for some, so they settled and populated one area; creating large civilizations that allowed specific social practices and cultures to develop respective of their location. Maybe one civilization valued arts and trade, while the other valued sciences,war e.t.c. Religions and philosophies were also formed that emphasized various ways of life, certain Asian martial arts are an example. This may just be a hypothetical but some groups may also have valued a specific animal that may or may not have been unique to their location and this could have influenced some behaviours exhibited by the group; like Hindus and not eating beef. Long story short, it's partly coincidence mixed with human nature; how we reacted to growing and developing in any particular location creates certain values and behaviours that can be seen as exclusive to one \textbf{race}, when really they are a result of circumstance.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Common, Race & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}2/312 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.641 \\  \hline

Populations of ancient Asian ancestry, including "Native Americans" have an essentially useless \textbf{alcohol} dehydrogenase enzyme, and the introduction of \textbf{alcohol} into their collective metabolism has had a severe effect on their culture and health. A sizeable portion of Caucasian Europeans are missing a liver cytochrome oxidase which makes them almost completely immune to codeine and codeine-based painkillers. People descended from Medieval European Hebrews have a predisposition to debilitating neurological sphingolipid storage disorders -- it is worth mentioning this effect can be positive too. That same gene is associated with the faster branching of dendrites in neurons of the developing brain, and is associated with early literacy, and as an aside Jews have a statistically significant bump in IQ over European descended populations. And we WILL have separate clinics, right now pharmacogenetics/pharmacogenomics is improving the efficacy of treatments for people of all ethnicities. As the era of personalized medicine comes into play, these genetic differences in populations will become even more important. You and Discovery are in agreement, but I don't see how anyone who is presented with the reality of contemporary genetics can come to this conclusion. It is because they are pushing a plainly false, warm-fuzzy abstraction from real science, and most sickeningly: calling the opposition "racial bias" and "unjustified prejudice".\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}alcohol & \cellcolor{green!27}Behavioural Addiction - Alcohol & \cellcolor{green!27}2/282 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.709 \\  \hline

In population genetics, this position is actually called 'Lewontin's Fallacy', named after Lewontin who famously proposed that there was more inter-individual variation than inter-population variation; and because of that, there is no such thing as racial classification. He was also peddling the same anti-science rhetoric as this exact video, and geneticists were so opposed he is immortalized with the word 'fallacy'. Ouch."Predisposition to certain diseases and ailments speak \textbf{nothing} about significant differences." This can be thrown right in the trash too. We know that pathology (the mechanism of disease) is just the tip of the iceberg -- all of the alleles which are genetically distant from you are fine-tuned from thousands of years under different selective pressures. This is why the differences are so important. To say we have identical body systems and brains is to intentionally ignore the fruits of pharmacogenetics and behavioral genetics. To say we have the same basic desires is saying \textbf{nothing}, because we are essentially just saying we are an animal.Yes. Individuals vary too.

Most people when they think of "\textbf{race}" they mean people with different appearance (mainly skin colors: white, \textbf{black}, \textbf{y\textbf{e\textbf{llow}}} etc)2. As you know or not - people brains link symbols to data - e.g: people link the skin color to the geographical area and thus to the different culture/behaviour.3. Different cultures might mean more aggressive or passive behaviour (if you had any interaction with different people from different countries around the world you might notice slight differences - of course that is all statistical, as humans we exhibit exceptions everywhere and that's natural, that's how evolution work).4. Nowadays people are mixed, yes - but there are some interesting facts - even though people of different races assimilated, they still show tendencies that (you could presume) were linked to their culture/geographical location. That is why concept of \textbf{race} still exist - cuz there are differences, not only of skin color.Differences:Many studies proved that \textbf{y\textbf{e\textbf{llow}}} \textbf{race} is most intelligent, then there is white and then \textbf{black}.Of course - as I noted earlier, those are only statistics - meaning that given \textbf{black} person can still be more intelligent than any \textbf{y\textbf{e\textbf{llow}}} or white person, but on AVERAGE they will not.There are also sources(gov. data) all over the world that \textbf{black} people tend to do more crimes than other races (might be intelligence-related, but might be not).Of course that is just \textbf{common} sense and this is not my field, however I think that logical reasoning and facts prove that you should reconsider the matter.I really note that this propaganda is \textbf{weird}, I dont feel offended when someone call me "white" but if I call someone "\textbf{black}" then I'm a \textbf{racist}... what?If I call \textbf{apple} a "\textbf{r\textbf{ed}} \textbf{apple}" or "\textbf{y\textbf{e\textbf{llow}}} \textbf{apple}" then I'm a \textbf{racist}?

When I ask you to consider something, as you have, you ignore it and copypaste some more thinly-veiled appeal to authority. Let's break this down. I'm really hoping for a real response, because you never seem to circle back."[...] bear little resemblance to a map of the world's self-identified autonomous human groups that are empowered to speak on behalf of their members."Empowered to speak on behalf of their members? Self-identified human groups? Who is empowered to speak for a 'self-identified group', exactly? Weasel words and arbitrary categories. Look at the Y-DNA haplogroup map I provided. It does exactly what Cavalli-Sforza says would not happen given a sample of diversity: we don't have to wonder what kinds of maps of human groups 'that WOULD BE produced', as he says. Look at the map that IS produced. What does 'the field-biologist's random-sampling approach' mean in 1998? As we speak, the 'field-biologist's' approach is shotgun sequencing a whole genome. Using genetic tests at an even lower resolution, let's say just Y-DNA, we can accurately group individuals into \textbf{ethnic} lineages. Which is not controversial in the population genetics world -- at all. It's just a fact."[...] population genomicists consistently have observed that 'the basic conclusion from the study of differences among [self-identified social] groups is that they are small compared with the differences within the groups themselves." Literally Lewontin's fallacy. Again. It was popular for a while. I feel like we've talked about this before. The author gets to cheat by saying "self-identified social groups". Weasel word. Next."The aspiration of `\textbf{race} purity' of classical \textbf{racism} is absurd."Wait, who cares? Are we talking about \textbf{race} purity or whether there are appreciable genetic differences between populations? You mean what uneducated "classical racists" hold in their mind about genetics is wrong? You don't say? What an easy target. This says absolutely \textbf{nothing}."Human biodiversity = scientific \textbf{racism}" (You)This is how I can tell we aren't even speaking the same language.

And I believe you've misread HUGO: about 95 of human diversity exists WITHIN races, not between them. You also make a false point with Bonobos. Humans are about 99 homologous to them, which means the genes we have that are the same are 99 the same... but if we include all genetic material that figure drops (we don't include all material because it's not clear how to count some types of mutations). Real taxonomy works by analysis of variance, not similarities. By this measure, humans are different from Bonobos, but not each other.

He came back and gave his case, providing his evidence that \textbf{black} Africans had indeed domesticated animals. The argument then turned to whether or not Sudani people are \textbf{black} \textbf{African}. Dr. Sertima showed phenotypical diversity of Africans and a melanin dosage test to show they are \textbf{black} \textbf{African}. An apposing Historian stood up and I quote "even if they were \textbf{black} they were white! just darkened by the sun."

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@treejoe4 Quite a bit. Here are just a small number of things that Africans have given to modern society: 1. Astronomy was created by Africans. Europeans who didn't understand it referred to them as "wise men" or "sorcerers." 2. Construction techniques: Most of our modern doorways (arches) came from Africa. 3. Architectural structures of buildings 4. An \textbf{African} man invented the stethoscope used by \textbf{doctors}. 5. Wall paintings of the ancient Egyptians depict the early use of plows. This invention involved an animal guided by a harness that was connected to a heavy, short-handled, long-bladed hoe, a tool that is still in use to this day. The use of the plow did not catch on to other cultures located outside of Africa until after the Bronze \textbf{Age} (right between the Stone and Iron \textbf{Age}). 6. The first 'plastic' material created by humans was linked to the ancient Africans. It was believed comprised of water, sand, and clay. When molded or shaped, it could make items (like pottery) that was later dried in the sun or baked until it became hard. 7. Basket-making techniques utilized twigs and reeds. As the weaving of baskets advanced, the Africans created mats that would become a stylized form of art in Egypt. 8. The cloth making that early Africans participated in thrived due to a variety of inventions. Since the fibers came in a naturally short form, they required assistance in being spun into threads so that cloth could be made. The Africans came up with ways on how to spin threads, as well as weave the threads into fabrics. By 4500 BC, weaving included the creation of rope. 9. In 35,000 BC the ancient Africans started using tally sticks (also known as counting sticks) as a way to keep track of numbers. The ancient \textbf{African} cultures were known as the first people in all the world to use a system of counting to keep track of their affairs. 10. Ancient Africans learned to use wood (taken from tree limbs), leather, bone, and fibers from plants to their benefit. When it came to the herbs and other plant materials of their environment, these substances were used to create medicine, art supplies, cosmetics, shelter, clothing, and vessels to hold their food. 11. Fish hooks in 50,000 BC 12. \textbf{Black} Ink 13. Paper 14. Organized labor 15. Invented the art of writing (hieroglyphics and other styles) 16. Sails 17. Looms for weaving 18. Baskets 19. • Flax was turned into impressive textiles through weaving by 3000 BC.  20. Our math techniques mainly came from Africa...including the Pythagorean Theorem which was created by a \textbf{black} guy and stolen and renamed by a Greek guy. 21. Africans taught Greek philosophers in their schools of disciples...then Greeks went out and taught the Romans then the Romans passed their knowledge onto us. 22. Plywood has been made for thousands of years; the earliest known occurrence of plywood was in Ancient Egypt around 3500 BC when wooden articles were made from sawn veneers glued together crosswise. This was originally done due to a shortage of fine wood. \textbf{Thin} sheets of high quality wood were glued over a substrate of lower quality wood for cosmetic effect, with incidental structural benefits. This manner of inventing plywood has occurred repeatedly throughout history. 23. South Africans are innovative problem-solvers. The country's top-class science and technology sector has produced many world firsts, including oil from coal, pioneering steel production, deep-level mining, and new medical and information technology. Oil from coal: Sasol is the world's first - and largest - oil-from-coal refinery. It is situated in Sasolburg in South Africa and provides 40 of the country's fuel. 24. The computed axial tomography scan, or CAT scan, was developed by South \textbf{African} physicist Allan Cormack and EMI Laboratories' Godfrey Hounsfield. Their achievement secured them the 1979 Nobel Prize in Medicine.  25. The world's first heart transplant was performed by Dr Chris Barnard in Cape Town on December 3, 1967. 26. By 1000 BC, woolen cloth was made by the ancient Africans. Africans created a lot of modern things before many Europeans figured it out. Europeans did invent things as well, but refused to give other groups credit for the contributions they made or the inventions that they created.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}African, Age, Black, Thin, doctors & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Ethnicity - Black, Nationality - General, Physical Identity - Physical Features & \cellcolor{green!27}9/709 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.269 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The PROTO-SAHARAN SCRIPT  (5000-3000 B.C.) Dr. Clyde Winters, author and historian, wrote that before the rise of the Egyptians and Sumerians there was a wonderful civilization in the fertile \textbf{African} Sahara, where people developed perhaps the world's oldest known form of writing. These inscriptions of what some archaeologists and linguists have termed 'proto-Saharan,' near the Kharga Oasis west of what was considered Nubia, date back as early as 5000 B.C.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!5}1/70 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.429 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The NIBSIDI SCRIPT (4500 B.C. - present) Nsibidi is an ancient script used to write various languages in West Central Africa. Most notably used by the Uguakima and Ejagham (Ekoi) people of Nigeria and Cameroon, nsibidi is also used by the nearby Ebe, Efik, Ibibio, Igbo and Uyanga people. The nsibidi set of symbols is an independent writing system and is believed by some scholars to date back to 5000 B.C., but the most decisive archaeological evidence ever found (monoliths in Ikom, Nigeria) dates it to 2000 B.C. Very similar to the Kemetic medu neter (called Egyptian hieroglyphics by the Greeks) nsibidi is a system of standardized pictographs. In fact, both nsibidi and the Kemetic medu neter share several of the exact characters. Nsibidi was divided into sacred and public versions, however, Westernization drastically reduced the number of nsibidi-literate people, leaving a sacred version as the last surviving form of the symbols. Still, nsibidi was transported to Cuba and Haiti via the Atlantic slave trade, where the anaforuana and veve symbols derived from the ancient west \textbf{African} script.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}African & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!27}1/178 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.562 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The WADI EL-HOL or PROTO-SINAITIC SCRIPT (2000 B.C. - 1400 B.C.) In 1999, Yale University archaeologists identified an alphabetic script in Wadi El-Hol, a narrow valley between Waset (Thebes) and Abdu (Abydos) in northern Sudan  southern Egypt. Dating to about 1900 B.C., the script bears resemblance to the Egyptian hieroglyphs, but also the much older 'proto-Saharan' writing system. A similar inscription that dates to 1500 B.C. was found in Serabit el-Khadim on Africa's Sinai peninsula, and has been deemed by linguists to be the basis for the so-called 'proto-Canaanite' and 'Phoenician' scripts for the linguistic link.

Of course I have the feeling DNews knows this, but by the same logic that feminists claims there can be no \textbf{racism} towards white people (because of application of uncommon definitions and the ignorance of context) DNews can claim that \textbf{race} in the informal meaning does not exist because it doesn't exist in the scientific sense. Now now I know that \textbf{racism} is bad, and i know that DNews doesn't support \textbf{racism}.

You backwards conservatives. Those are like your main principles, "deny anything that does against the bible or the word of the lord"  which for some reason includes evolution and climate change. evolution was just an example on how ignorant people in your political view are.umm, Christianity was founded 2,000 years ago. How could there be a book for a religion if the book is older than the religion itself? If anything, the bible is younger than 2,000 years.We tolerate people that deserve, things people can't control or have no say over. Like \textbf{race}, sexuality, \textbf{mental} health. Things ignorant people like conservatives normally discriminate against because they are different. While most liberals embrace differences and cherish them.Also, just like conservatism, liberalism does not have set rules for everybody to say they are liberal.

If I understand correctly.Nonetheless, the bible that all Christians refer to help their arguments, was written around when Christianity was founded, 2,000 years ago. If you want to rely on the \textbf{old} testament, that's even older. So either way, both books are incredibly \textbf{old} and people still base their lives off them. People still use the bible only to their benefit, but when it goes against them "oh, that doesn't matter"Fro example, here was a fun scenario I heard about.Christian mom: "being \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} is wrong, the bible says so"normal daughter: "What is your shirt made of?"Christian mom: "What?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Wow, the liberalism in here is intense.1.) "America is still plagued with \textbf{racist} ideology." Nice choice of subjective wording. Sure, in some sense the US has numerous \textbf{race} problems. However, they've been getting progressively better and better. Compare the racial issues of today with 50 years ago. 100 years ago. 200 years ago. There have been VAST improvements. That's not to say that there aren't still issues, nor am I attempting to minimize the racial issues of today.2.) "In terms of biology \textbf{race} doesn't exist." Strictly from a biological sense this is true. The term "\textbf{race}" has been appropriated to mean something else. And if that's the case, then why are we talking about what biologists call \textbf{race}? We should be looking at it from a anthropological point of view, not a biological view. While the quote is true, it simply doesn't matter here.In fact, the video goes on to say that it's a cultural idea and has \textbf{nothing} to do with our biology. Well, why bring it up then?3.) "Scientists have used \textbf{race} to refer to a sub-species." Again, true, but irrelevant. We're talking about the cultural idea of \textbf{race}, not the biological one. Please stop bringing it up if it has no bearing on the matter at hand.4.) Certain races ARE susceptible to certain illnesses. Blacks have almost no chance of getting skin cancer. This is directly from their genes. I can list a dozen other diseases that are more likely to affect one \textbf{race} than another.5.) "these illnesses are highly correlated with..." Correlation is not causation. Though, while we're at it, they've also shown to correlated by \textbf{race} as well. You can't claim one and then not the other.6.) We've established that \textbf{race} as a scientific concept doesn't exist." LOL You've already said it does. Numerous times. While I'll agree that it doesn't make sense to talk about it in the biological sense, there are other areas where it makes perfect sense to discuss it. How can you contradict yourself like that? I'm truly flabbergasted that you claim again and again that \textbf{race} is a thing within science, then say it doesn't exist as a scientific concept. At least be consistent.7.) If the Nazis had won, we would not be any more inbred than we are now. There is plenty of genetic diversity within Germany alone to not have to worry about genetic defects. And world wide? Please, just stop. This is embarrassing.Also, I'm invoking Godwin's Law. 8.) "If you want to know more about what science has to say on \textbf{race}..."

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The idea that \textbf{race} has \textbf{nothing} to do with biology is not tenable. A competent researcher can look at someone's genome, or skeleton, and predict their \textbf{race} with a high degree of accuracy. The fact that everyone's genome is 99.9 the same doesn't change the fact that there are large differences. That .1 amounts to, on average, 3 million base pair differences between a pair of individuals. A difference of a single base pair can cause a significant difference. For instance, the genetic disease sickle cell anemia is caused by a mutation in a single base pair. The video mentions subspecies but fails to tell the audience that human races are more genetically distant from each-other than many subspecies among other animals are. I think that is a pretty important fact to bring up when discussing the reality of \textbf{race}. The discussion of \textbf{race} differences in disease rate is also lacking because it ignores the fact that some of these differences have clear genetic bases. For instance, because of a high frequency of a specific gene variant \textbf{African} Americans have more sensitive androgen receptors than other Americans and this is part, though not all, of why they have high rates of prostate cancer. To give a second example, there was recently a study that found that two gene variants known to put people at risk for diabetes are more \textbf{common} among the Mexican population than among the American population. The discussion of clines is also problematic. A Cline refers to a situation in which a trait changes very gradually and as a function of geographical distance. Skin color, which changes very gradually as populations move away from the equator, is a \textbf{common} example of this. But not all human genetic variation is clinal. There are sharp discontinuities in how gene frequencies changes across populations. This is why if you compare three populations that are all equally distance from each-other in terms of geography the two that are within the same \textbf{race} will be more similar genetically. Racial categories are artifacts of culture in the sense that they are categories that humans invent. But they are categories that group people based on real biological differences and are no less valid than any other category used in biology, all of which were invented by humans.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African, Common, Nothing, Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}9/383 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.35 \\  \hline

There are genetic differences in different groups of people who developed in different environs; these persist today even after technology should eliminate the need for such specialization.Why?Because we are conscious thinking beings with (often irrational) emotions and ideas. Look at dogs.. We've forcibly bred wildly different breeds. But if you stick a female chihuahua and a male dane in the same cage during estrus you'll end up with some funny looking puppies, lol. Dogs don't care about artificially created "races" amongst themselves, because they lack the cognizance. Humans on the other hand have created false delineations based on outward appearance. An evolved fear of the "other" coxes people to mate with those most similar to them - ergo the (still artificially generated) construct of \textbf{race}. It is artificial in the sense that it took conscious human effort to keep from mating with people who they perceived as being too different (but may have still desired, as evidenced by "\textbf{black} porn" and "\textbf{midget} porn", etc. etc.)When "races" are no longer able to produce viable offspring with one another, then we should be having a different discussion.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@omgcow well the way i understand it is that what we commonly refer to as \textbf{race} correspond to little more than those genes that determine skin color and minor morphological features. You can distinguish people basing on what is immediately evident to your eye, overlooking other features that are determined by gene expression. For instance, europeans are more similar to asians as compared to africans when it comes to skin color  but, when you look at blood type distribution, it is the other way around. Also you are ignoring clustering. You could distinguish between white people and e.g. \textbf{black} people if you look at alleles frequencies in certain dna regions, but overall, white people and \textbf{black} people do not constitute homogeneous groups. That is to say the variance of such allele frequencies within white people and \textbf{black} people is higher than the variance between these two groups. Not that it matters much when it comes to \textbf{racism}. I am no expert in this subject (I worked on population genetics, but not in humans), and frankly you might prove me wrong on human dna variation patterns. Still I believe it is wrong and pointless to give any importance to the \textbf{race}, when we discuss about our species. cheers\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Race, Racism & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}6/207 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.899 \\  \hline

[LINK] AncestryIn living and past peoples, there is wide range of variability. Despite this variability, our bones have features that can be clues to ancestry. Many of these features reflect evolutionary processes, including adaptation to the environment. Bone cells retain "biogeographical" information that is found in our DNA. These inherited markers are due to mutational changes that gradually accumulate and differentiate populations over time. DNA can help associate an individual with a region of the world.We can also assess ancestral origins by looking at the skeleton itself. The bones of the skull express inherited features from one generation to the next. Measuring the cranium gives us information that is similar to that from DNA.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small You make a good argument, but I think you are using specific examples to muddy the general point, a bit; this video was essentially trying to assert how humans, despite racial differences, are very much the same species and even  genus, with the biological variance being minimal at best.  A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by \textbf{sexual} reproduction; this video basically asserts that our "races" don't make us different in any fundamental biological way because by and large humans of varying ethnicities can and do reproduce successfully, making the base argument very much viable in terms of the biology.Now, for the sake of the discussion above and the points you raised specifically, I do see how  this definition, though technically accurate and adequate, if looked at more closely, can become somewhat problematic. This goes to other ways of defining a species, including similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche.  Please note, "\textbf{Race}" specifically doesn't come into this. But, to be fair again, the presence of regionally adaptive traits which accont for racial diversity in humanity may be seen in a way which further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies. But again, there is no solid argument for saying one \textbf{race}/ethnicity is a "subspecies" of another; you can track all modern-day human DNA back to  Africa, despite the percentage of variation. I'm going to use some examples you cited to make my future points:"That .1 amounts to, on average, 3 million base pair differences between a pair of individuals. A difference of a single base pair can cause a significant difference. For instance, the genetic disease sickle cell anemia is caused by a mutation in a single base pair."Basically, you were going for genetic variation and dissimilarity here. And factually, this is true. However, please keep in mind that the overall variation in human DNA is very small over all, especially when compared to other species. Scientist theorize that this possibly suggests a "population bottleneck" during the Late Pleistocene period, but it also goes to how close we are linked inspite of regional variation [\textbf{race}]. Why i say you are being a little "too specific" is because  you are using nearly infintismal [arguably] genetic differences as a way to validate "racial" differences. Dude, no two humans....not even monozygotic twins ....are genetically identical. Genes, lifestyle and environment influence human biological variation from visible characteristics [weight gain] to physiology to disease susceptibly to \textbf{mental} abilities. And again, being fair, the exact influence of genes and environment on certain traits is not really well understood yetMost current genetic, evolutionary or archaeological evidence supports a relatively recent, single origin of modern humans from within East Africa, with first migrations placed at 60,000 years ago. That is all of human kind, eh! So yeah; we're a relatively young species.  Compared to the great apes, human gene sequences....even among \textbf{African} populations....are remarkably homogeneous. This is why, by most estimations on average, genetic similarity between any two humans is 99.9. And you are right; that .1 does account for a lot.  But this doesn't change the simple fact: there is about 2–3 times more genetic diversity within the wild chimpanzee population, than in the entire human gene pool! By this alone, the broader reasoning of the video that we are "all the same \textbf{race}" has some proper grounding.When you say we as humans are "more distant than many subspecies", what exactly do you mean by that?\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}African, Mental, Race, Sexual & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}5/589 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.849 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Shenruss Mornin'. No I'm not stating hybrid vigor doesn't exist, because it does. Too bad it doesn't have anything to do with this argument as it applies to a whole different level of genetic difference.Hybrid vigor is only a positive thing if the alternative is incest, in which case the genetic similarities would be too severe in terms of alleles, not just genes. You won't even face that problem in the first place if you breed with someone who isn't closely blood-related to you even though they're of the same \textbf{race}, as that already counts as hybrid vigor. In that case there is enough allele variation to prevent side effects of incest.Mating with someone of a different \textbf{race} however introduces quite a few problems, a phenomenon called outbreeding depression (if whoever told you about hybrid vigor didn't tell you about outbreeding depression in respect to humans they were purposely misleading you. Just letting you know).All population groups such as races have some distinct groups of genes or sets of alleles that reoccur within that group, sort of like a genetic fingerprint. If two individuals of the same population group mate, the offspring will inherit the same group of genes and alleles, with a bit of variation (this is hybrid vigor). These gene-groups often deal with metabolism or some form of adaptation to the environment where that population group lived for generations. What's important about this is that they're only effective together in that distinct group (this is called genetic integrity).If two people of different races mate, their offspring won't inherit either one of the genetic finger prints of either parent, but rather parts of one and parts of the other group. This group of genes lacks genetic integrity and thus loses its functionality (statistically most of the time. There are exceptions in which the resulting genetic group had some advantageous functionality, but those are rare cases). This is why during evolution, mixed individuals of different races of any species have been less successful in terms of survival than non-mixed individuals.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/344 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.581 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Hey friend. Thanks for the indepth reply. Allow me the indulgence of a few more queries and response.1] The incest analogy is a bit misleading, isn't it? I mean, while its true you can find strong matches of superior genes within the same \textbf{race}, is it not also true that the aforementioned differences in genetic alleles of peoples bred in completely diverse localities have a large baring on creating new patterns should they be interbred? I mean, that's how the mutation that allows for lactose tolerance came about...By this, what I'm addressing is a possibility for stronger genes in a non-homogenous society. Practically, this has been expressed; studies done in heavily mixed populaces, like South American countries such as Brasil, have shown a greater genetic variance  in terms of \textbf{race}, and facinating trends towards higher rates of health associated with such. Certain types of anemia and genetic pre-cursors to heart desease or type I diabetes have been shown to be lower in the children of mixed \textbf{black} and caucasian ancestry. This runs counterpoint to your arument of outbreeding depression. Which is the next point.2]Have there been any significant human examples of outbreeding depression?  Don't get me wrong; i know that this phenomenon occurs when intermediate genotypes are not adapted to either parental habitat, or there's a breakdown in physical compatability resulting in a decline or disadvantage.  But human beings aren't Ligers; a mixed \textbf{race} human has been shown just as genetically viable to produce ioff spring as one who took genetic material from a single \textbf{race}. The genetic integrity isn't compromised by some form of beneficial mutation, then, not so? I have no hard data to go off here, but has that not predominantly been the case?3] Mixed parentage individuals have been less successful? What do you base that on, because it largely contradicts the presence of the various mixed \textbf{race} individuals throughout the world. Hell, in the US alone, it's considered that barely 10 of  the Afro american populace is "totally" \textbf{black} or can trace the totality of their genetic code back to Africa with no other \textbf{race} being evident. Uusually, its only very insular popluations which have such genetic healthy homogeniety ("healthy" here meaning without incest becoming a factor).I'll defer to your knowledge as a biochemist as opposed to mine as a science buff and cultural researcher, but having any imperical evidence would go a long way towards explaining your point.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Sure thing.1] Not really, because populations adapt to their specific environments over many generations, thus creating these genetic fingerprints that are advantageous in their specific habitats I was talking about. So when two individuals of different populations mate, their offspring will lack either genetic fingerprint in most cases. It's really rare (I couldn't name any examples, but theoretically it's possible) that by chance a new combination of genes/alleles could have an advantage over the non mixed individuals. It's just really unlikely.The lactose gene didn't come about through interbreeding of different races. All human babies have always had the ability to digest milk (as that's pretty much all they eat while breastfeeding), humans just lose that ability as soon as they can deal with other food sources like meat (this was important because producing the enzyme lactase to digest milk cost energy and was unneccessary for grown ups). But when humans transitioned towards settlers and farmers instead of hunters and gatherers, there was milk available as a food source, so those who randomly had the ability to digest milk had an evolutionary advantage over everyone else as they had more food at their disposal. It's because of this evolutionary pressure that nature selected for individuals who didn't lose their ability to digest milk. And they got it through random mutation that happens whenever an egg is fertilized. Whenever two parents create offspring, not only are their alleles are distributed randomly to the offspring, there's also mutations happening which increase genetic diversity (and prevent incest side effects). One of these mutations was not losing the ability to create lactase as far as I know.I'd like to see a source on the claim about mixed people being more healthy. Here's one possible explanation: When a population developes homogenously for many generations without disturbance, they will not develope any resistances against illnesses they never faced. So when modern times came about and more heart disease and diabetes-causing foods were available, that population was pretty much helpless against the never before encountered threats like diabetes. So only when mixing with individuals that have some resistance to those diseases, the offspring will profit from that. So if that resistance was inherited through mixing with resistant individuals, that's only logical. But if that resistance came about out of recombination/mutation by mixing with two non-resistant parents, you'd have a point.2] Not really, for a few reasons. 1) When humans developed knowledge about outbreeding depression, we were already living in advanced civilizations so that the side effects are no problem anymore. We don't have to fight for survival in the wild anymore so if we lack some of those genetic fingerprints we're still fine. Another reason is politics. During the 60s and 70s when we made advances in biology and the necessary technology, the movement against \textbf{racism} started taking off as well. Equal housing act was in 74 I believe and so on, it became less socially accepted to be \textbf{racist} and talking about \textbf{race} became taboo. I'd be interested as well, I just won't get any funding as it's a delicate subject. Newspapers would claim I'm trying to prove superiority of one \textbf{race} over another or of pure breds over mixed people, there's no way anyone would fund a project with that risk, unless the results are "politically correct", know what I mean?So we have to rely on what we observed in the animal kingdom and extrapolate unfortunately. As for ligers, they're rare. And there's a reason for that: Although they can reproduce, they don't reproduce as frequently as lions or tigers, they get outbred simply put. However, because tigers and lions keep mixing, there's a constant supply of new ligers in addition to the offspring among ligers. So generally these hybrid populations aren't as evolutionary successful (as explained in the next point).3] I'm referring to evolution thousands of years ago. The side effects of outbreeding aren't a problem nowadays anymore (although you'll find things like depression more commonly among mixed people. One hypothesis is that mixed individuals lack a sense of belonging to either parent as they often don't resemble either parent because of skin color or facial features). But back when humans lived in the woods and caves these minor genetic advantages were vital in terms of who gets to reproduce more often than others. Also, it was much harder for people to mix because travelling to a geographical location until you find a population that was somewhat different from your own so it occured rarely, or depending on season or climate change or whatever. As far as I know the few mixed individuals that came about rarely outbred their non-mixed counterparts. They sometimes introduced some genetic variation to the genepool that was somewhat beneficial (like with the monoculture thing), but unless there was specific evolutionary pressure towards those mixed individuals (like with the case about diabetes you mentioned) they didn't last many generations.As for sources: I'm not a population biologist. I could tell you a lot about bacteria and how to modify them so they shit out biodegradeable plastics, but I'm not that familiar with sources on anthropological evolutionary history. I'm taught about all the mechanics that cause evolution and how to apply them in the lab.Thanks for the discussion so far!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Race, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}4/885 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.452 \\  \hline

While we are talking about a few genes differences those genes code for proteins that number in the trillions if not greater in magnitude.The Human body is a chemical reaction that is highly sensitive to initial conditions and if there are subtle differences in initial conditions they can have dramatic implications for the superstructure of the chemical reaction we call the human. We grant variation between difference species.We accept variation within difference species.I think we all would say variation occurs within a \textbf{race}Additionally variation occurs within an \textbf{ethnicity}We would also not deny that variation happens withing horizontal familial lines ( between siblings)What we, for some strange reason, seem to sanctify is this category of \textbf{race} which is no more a social construct in an ontological sense the the Kingdom - species schema we employ within taxonomy.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Hey dude. Man, Chretz, you rock, presenting your points fairly and in as unbiased a way as possible. I appreciate that. however, you kind of contradicted yourself a bit.1] "when two individuals of different populations mate, their offspring will lack either genetic fingerprint in most cases." Ok, fair enough. But the contradiction comes in when you suppoert my  [admittedly less detailed] example of the lactose gene. Certain races, like Native Americans, possess almost no ability to digest milk as adults; they simply didn't evolve that way based on their enviornmental needs.  However,  in the US and Canada alone, there currently exist many mixed people of Native American decent who have absolutely no problem drinking milk. You are correct, this is a beneficial mutation that came about centuries ago when a large part of our species moved from hunter-gatherer to Agriculture-based life styles, but fact remains it does serve as a form of hybrid vigor because a parent with the mutation passed it on to their child, making the kid "stronger" or at least "better suited" to a modern day enviornment and diet, even though the other parent did not possess this capacity.Perhaps I'm oversimplifying the term "hybrid vigor" here, so let's change format.  Would you agree that it is fair to say that "Racial mixing" in such example did produce a same species being that had an adavtage over one parent due to the genetic change? the mere fact that you called it an "evolutionary advantage" means that, due to the wider gene pool,  a positive was gained via that type of interbreeding.2] "I'd like to see a source on the claim about mixed people being more healthy. Here's one possible explanation: When a population developes homogenously for many generations without disturbance, they will not develope any resistances against illnesses they never faced." Very good point. But i think that works both ways. again citing the lactose intolerance example; not every child born of the same mixed parent bonding is going to get the advantageous genes. I mean hell, you have examples in the Afro American community of siblings, one who is lactose tolerant, and the other who isn't. So not only is nearly impossible to guage any form of genetic recombination outside of the womb (or at least without intially knowing specific RNA coding which could result in particular alleles being expressed), its by no means "gauraunteed" that a range of offspring from the same mixed \textbf{race} pair will come out with all genetic adavantages. I can site a few comprehensive studies, but the ones that stick out most are the ones done at the University of Edinburgh in 2010, I think. The team there analysed health and genetic information from more than 100 different studies carried out around the world dealing with ethnically diverse couples and populaces, and the offspring thereof.The team found that greater genetic diversity is linked to increased height. It is also associated with better cognitive skills, as well as higher levels of education, but only mimimally affected a person's chance of developing high blood pressure or cholesterol levels. They did note however, that for genetic deseases which typically effect one \textbf{race} more than another, such as sicle cell anemia or Lou Gherigs desease,  mixed off spring have a significantly slighter chance of developing them than children who were born to parents of the same \textbf{race}. This is regardless of whether both same \textbf{race} parents were potential carriers of the genes which indicated greater susceptability or not;even if only one parent had the dormant genes, a mixed child still had less likelihood of developing it than a "full blooded" kid. This kind of contradicts my earlier point of not every child gaining an advantage, but it does support the Hybrid vigor theory. 3] Hmmm. "The side effects of outbreeding aren't a problem nowadays anymore (although you'll find things like depression more commonly among mixed people.)" Well I guess there's very little to add to here. I can only cite the various mixed populaces all over the world and how many of them are thriving; take many places in South America, the Polynesian islands, and Eurasia, for example. But to be fair, we don;t have enough imperical evidence t o say if any possible advantages are genetic in nature, or as a result of lifestyle. I mean, technically speaking, the Okinawan and Japanese population are some of the healthiest and long living, world wide, despite that society being largely genetically homogenous. But they adapt to seasonal weather changes, walk often, eat diets rich in fish and veggies everyday, and rarely indulge in excesses; this is resulted in them having some of the highest life expactancy of any country,  many of them living to be active at ages over 100. So anything we both try to provide here will be speculative, at best."One hypothesis is that mixed individuals lack a sense of belonging to either parent as they often don't resemble either parent because of skin color or facial features..."This I have a little more gounding in. And you're right! Sense of "identiy" with a group, though often influenced by physical traists [which are expressions of genetic factors] is largely a social construct , and deals more with  cultural \textbf{ethnicity} than any genetic expression. And that's kind of the point of this video; our greatest differences as a species are not physical or genetic. This is why the whole argument of "\textbf{Race}" within our species is so...so maddeningly complex! It's true that we can use specific markers to judge the probability of a person's genetic origins based on place, but that doesn't mean we're a different sub taxa of species! I'll quote a 1998 American Anthropological Association' statement on \textbf{race} here: 'the idea of ‘\textbf{race}' has always carried more meanings than mere physical differences; indeed, physical variations in the human species have no meaning except the social ones that humans put on them.'  This isn't the only such affirmation; in 2002, the American Sociological Association published a work, The Importance of Collecting Data and Doing Social Scientific Research on \textbf{Race}  with a statement emphasizing the social foundation of \textbf{race} as an idea:  '...although racial categories are legitimate subjects of empirical sociological investigation, it is important to recognize the danger of contributing to the popular conception of \textbf{race} as biological.' (ASA 2003)As to you not being a population biologist...dude, I appreciate the conversation you have indulged me in thus far, regardless! your information has been invaluable, especially considering my limited expertise in this field. And if you are one of the people trying to find ways to turne used crude oil and petro waste into harmless or reusable materials, my dude...*more power to you!* I'd probably ask you to put that big brain to work on trying to find a formula which could optimize the latent genetic markers of a human so we could all be our most healthy and attractive [and thus get dates of any \textbf{race} more easily], but.... you;re work is already important. Besides, I'm certain you and your Nobel team could figure that out later. ;-) Bless up, man\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity, Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}11/1190 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.924 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Now that's a rare compliment, thanks! That goes right back.1] The example with the lactose tolerance genetics isn't hybrid vigor, as one of the parents already had the genetics to digest lactose. If the parent that had the ability to digest lactose mated with another parent that had the same ability (for example by not mixing races), their offspring would also have the same ability, meaning that by mixing races there was no advantage gained. So the offspring didn't improve over their parents, they just inherited what one of the parents already had, but we only speak of heterosis when the offspring's abilities outperform both parents. Don't get me wrong, this commonly happens, but there's no advantage in the parents being of different races, there's enough variation on allele-level within pretty much every \textbf{race} of every species.Suppose you have two parents that are homozygous about every gene they have, meaning they only have two identical alleles for every gene, so either two dominant or two recessive alleles for every gene. Let's also assume that every gene that is homozygously recessive in one parent, it's homozygously dominant in the other. Once they cross, their offspring will be heterozygous in all their genes (hence the term heterosis), because for every gene he received one recessive and one dominant allele. But because in heterozygotes only the dominant allele has an effect while the recessive allele is repressed, the offspring will express the dominant version of all his genes. Assuming that the dominant version is typically associated with being the more advantageous (not always the case, just more \textbf{common}), the offspring will outperform either parent. THIS is called heterosis.The example with the lactose tolerance through cross-breeding of two parents with different abilities regarding one metabolic process has no specific name as far as I know, but it does not fall in the category of heterosis as far as I know.But you are right in that it was obviously beneficial to the offspring. The benefits of the introduction of this gene definitely outweighed the side effects of outbreeding depression that occured as well. But understand that this example is not the rule, it's not often that a genetic ability such as lactose tolerance is introduced every time individuals of two races mix, or even the majority of times.2] You're right, not all of the mixed offspring will be born with the advantage in question. But the ones that do typically have more offspring, thus increasing the percentage of the population that has it and so on. This is true for any beneficial genetic trait. It's even possible that some populations developed the ability to digest lactose just like central europeans did, but since it didn't provide any advantage in their lifestyles as they didn't have the option to consume milk, the ability died out again.I'm really curious about those studies. Can't really argue about mixed people being taller on average than non-mixed, I didn't know that (I'll just double check though: Do they mean mixed offspring is taller on average than non-mixed people of the parent races? Or do they mean just taller than people of the \textbf{race} that's less tall on average? There's tons of rhetorical traps like these that you usually encouter when you read news about science, or scientists that cite other scientists' studies and so on). When you say "cognitive skills", that's a really broad term (another rhetorical trap, it's really important to be precise with these claims). Are they talking about IQ or something specific? How exactly did they measure cognitive skills?Also, funny you mention sickle-cell anemia: Did you know that people that are heterozygous for sickle-cell anemia are protected against dying from malaria? I'm not even kidding. In some parts of africa where there's a lot of malaria, there actually is evolutionary pressure in favour of heterozygotes in sickle-cell anemia. This means that exposure to malaria leads to more sickle-cell anemia over generations, and the funny thing is, those with sickle-cell anemia are the ones that have the advantage. Mother nature has a sick sense of humor. But of course this has \textbf{nothing} to do with the topic. But again I must ask to clarify: Are they really saying that mixed people are overall less prone to sickle-cell anemia than any "pure-bloods"?  Because sickle-cell anemia is primarily an \textbf{african} thing. It never occured in Europe or Asia in any notable way and it's a purely genetic disease.3] I agree with that entire paragraph.About the social aspects of belonging and the \textbf{mental} consequences: I agree partly. Sense of identity, although based on physical traits is a purely \textbf{mental} thing. However, it's part of our hard-wiring. Belonging to ones own tribe and being primarily hostile  suspecting towards "the other" is at least partly innate behaviour. Because not only has mankind fought wild animals in order to survive, we also fought each other in spades. Tribes would clash to fight for territory, access to water/food sources, females, you name it. Until the invention of language and some form of civilization  settlements, different tribes would rarely cooperate. At least some sort of mistrust or caution towards "the other" is a subconscious reaction in humans.Of course this can undoubtedly be either enhanced or decreased through upbringing, but the hard wiring is hard to get rid of.About your citation of the american anthropological association: It's tough to argue against that. But I will ask you this: Don't you think the things we discussed about show that there is a biological foundation to races in humans? Another thing is the paper you mentioned about the health effects in mixed offpspring: If there is no biological basis to races in humans, how did that paper even find any significant results that differenciate between mixed and non-mixed people in the first place?Now this might sound like a conspiracy theory, but I can tell you, I have encountered first hand (well, second hand. I'm not an anthropologist ;) ): Do you think that I had any chance publishing a paper that's based on the comments I wrote to you so far? Do you think any scientific journal would publish an article that even just hints towards racial differences in humans? Or do you think that same anthropologists that said "it is important to recognize the danger of contributing to the popular conception of \textbf{race} as biological" would say the same thing about races in dogs or cats or any other mammal besides humans? Of course not.It's politics. It's the exact same thing with GMO's or the tons of "scientific papers" funded by Monsanto. It's hard to convince people how much politics influences (or rather: hinders) science as the ones who provide the funding are often the ones who expect a certain result.Thanks for that kind last paragraph, that's rare on youtube :) If you're interested, I'm currently contributing to a project in which we're trying to use bacteria to create bio-degradeable plastics. Certain strains of bacteria can be used to insert a genetic sequence into their genome that enables them to metabolize the carbon from CO2 and convert it into a substance that can later be used to create bio-degradeable plastics. If that works and we get that technology cheap enough so it goes mainstream, ocean pollution might be solved. If being a world-saviour isn't attractive to people of all races, I don't know what is!

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Just read your reply, buddy, and want to take some time to regard your response, verify the fidnings I gave to you last time, and make my own. Just wanted to, again, let you know youi are like 6 different kinds of awesome, and definitely wis you and your team luck!Seriously, the implication of a non dangerous bacteria that can alter the polymer or even molecular stucture of CO2 to create new plastics?  Outstanding! My only concerns there would be how these new plastics would affect our own bio structures;  research over the last decade has been worrisome in showing that even our relatively "Safe" plastics , when exposed to our food and water, have the capacity to release xeno estrogens or even become toxic when heated. Considering Western health has been on the decline for over 40s year due to envuiornmental pollutants, that's not comforting.But  I digress.  If you and your team can fix this problem, there's \textbf{nothing} to limit you from perhaps creating some sustainable, healthy plastic products, not to mention the bio degradable fuel.  I'm surprised big industry hasn;t yet found the veritable gold mine that is non fossle fuels . Hell, George Washington Carver managed to create fuel from peanut oil decades ago!

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Comeon mate, don't flatter me too much ;) But thank you so much.I know right? Simply put, we just take a normal bacterium you find in most ponds, we tinker with its genome for a bit, insert a sequence and boom: It basically shits out valuable plastics while simultaneously removing CO2 from the air. Containers with these CO2-consuming bacteria could serve as filters near power plants, where they would get fresh CO2 and optimal growth conditions, practically working in symbiosis with the power plant. Imagine how far technology has come!Your concern is totally valid, we haven't even concidered the health implications of these plastis yet. First we gotta get these bacteria to produce plastics in the first place, one step at a time. But who knows, if we won't be able to use them for food packaging, we will find other uses, plastics are useful everywhere nowadays. Worst case, we might just use them as carbon based fuel (which would be ironic), in that case the CO2 balance is \textbf{zero} as all carbon in those plastics did come from CO2 in the first place.One milestone of the project is to get the cost down so it's an economically attractive alternative to fossil fuel based plastics, that's when new markets for this product will open up and that's where the big money might be.Thanks again for the kind words, we'll do our best!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Zero & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!27}1/236 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.424 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small But scientists do say that \textbf{race} is a biological thing. Sincerely, a biochemist.What you said about Neanderthals is true, they are a subspecies like Sapiens. The catch is that pretty much everyone of european descent has some percentage of neanderthal genome that exactly \textbf{nobody} of \textbf{african} descent has. These are significant and measurable genetic differences. So how did this happen? Simple: Your statement about a subspecies not being able to just reproduce with another is false. Neanderthals and Sapiens had no trouble mating.What you said about all humans of today being able to mate with each other may be true but is no argument against the biological foundation of \textbf{race}, you'll see what I mean as soon as you try to apply that argument to different dog races. Who you can mate with says \textbf{nothing} about what \textbf{race} you're part of, it gives a hint of what species you're part of but that's it.Lastly, you're right about height being only partially genetically determined, but a 6'5 asian will still look clearly asian, same with a 4'3 \textbf{african} or european.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Chretze​​​​ well I didn't state scientist denied anything I am arguing the defining of \textbf{race} as if we are all separate sub species. I'm not arguing the clear genetic differences we see are not based in biology but rather they do not amount to what biologist would call speciation. Also the 1 to 2.5 neanderthal(\& Denisovan  dna) found in populations that left out of Africa doesn't point to humans \& neanderthals easily reproducing with one another. It points to them reproducing but we do not know if cross Sapien/Neanderthal pregnancies were as viable as same species pregnancies. I've read where some scientists feel Neanderthal belongs in the Sapiens club ...but that's another debate  [LINK]  I never said sub species could not reproduce just that they have trouble doing so or as I said "cannot easily reproduce". Also we are talking about the genus Homo not Panthera or Equus. Both Equus(Horses,Donkeys,Zebras)\& Panthera(Lions,Tigers,Leopards,etc) are far older animal organisms \& have far more speciation thus yes would have a harder time reproducing than the relatively young genus of Homo who just one \textbf{common} ancestor back were all the same bloke. As for dog breeds this is a fallacy most people use as an analogy to human "races". For one dogs have been artificially hybridized at an accelerated pace.  [LINK] The genetic distance between dogs is 3 to 4x's that as between humans.(ruffly 25 variation in dogs to 5 to 10 in humans) [LINK]  Most Dog breeds couldn't survive with out humans. Homo Sapiens on the other hand are products of natural evolution.The thing is that evolution proves that the bone structure,skin \& facial features are subject to change over a long enough period \& exposure to the right environmental stimuli. In fact it's environment that drives the biological mutations in mankind.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Actually let's start with the fact that there is no such thing as a direct test of general \textbf{mental} ability. What IQ tests measure directly is the test-taker's display of particular cognitive skills: size of vocabulary, degree of reading comprehension, facility with analogies, and so on. Any conclusions about general \textbf{mental} ability are inferences drawn from the test-taker's relative mastery of those various skills.Secondly, French adoption studies that controlled for the socioeconomic status of birth and adoptive parents  found that being raised by high-SES (socioeconomic status) parents led to an IQ boost of between 12 and 16 points - which is  a statistically HUGE improvement that testifies to the powerful influence that upbringing can have.Also A study of twins by psychologist Eric Turkheimer and colleagues that similarly tracked parents' education, occupation, and income yielded especially striking results. Specifically, they found that the "heritability" of IQ - the degree to which IQ variations can be explained by genes - varies dramatically by socioeconomic class. Heritability among high-SES (socioeconomic status) kids was 0.72; in other words, genetic factors accounted for 72 percent of the variations in IQ, while shared environment accounted for only 15 percent. For low-SES kids, on the other hand, the relative influence of genes and environment was inverted: Estimated heritability was only 0.10, while shared environment explained 58 percent of IQ variations. To summarise socioeconomic factors can far outweigh genetic contributions in terms of innate IQ. What you "\textbf{Race} Repeaters" love to exclude from your rants is the fact that when IQ tests are repeated controlling for socioeconomic factors blacks and whites score similarly.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I will even add that I did an IQ test and in the end, what does it ask of you?- To find the synonyms of word, expression (You learn it at school).- To find the recurrence of a geometric suite, the continuation of a geometric series (And locating you in space, geometry and \textbf{mental} calculation that you learn at school can serve).- To complete expressions, to solve a verbal reasoning (You learn it at school).- To find what geometrical form is the intruder (There, only your own reason can help you).- To memorize images to say which image was not present (And school teaches you its methodology and trains you regularly to memorize what prepares your brain to react faster, school thus serves here.)- To solve a logical sequence (School trains you there and can help you.)- And to solve problems of mathematics and \textbf{mental} calculation (You learn it at school).So that makes 7/8 things that are directly related or influenced by school, a little much to say then that IQ is absolutely not based on education.In addition, graphs were made in France in relation to the IQ of the population and their degree, and we see just a huge correlation : [LINK] (In the first graph, you can see the IQ of people being non-dimpled up to those with a BAC+5 (5 years of study after the high school graduation),In the second graph, you can see the IQ of people in relation to their occupation (which is directly correlated to the level of study),And in the third graph, you can see people's IQ in relation to \textbf{age}.)So of course that IQ is very much influenced by education, IQ is not a test that calculates your abilities but your logical performances, performances that you train at school and therefore the tricks or the logical metodolgies are provided to you by school, IQ does not measure anything here, like a math test! x')(Besides, the book \textbf{Race}, Education and Behavior reinforces this fact with the fact that a \textbf{black} adopted by whites has a higher IQ (90) than a \textbf{black} adopted by blacks (~85), than a \textbf{black} living with his biological family (80) ; where the wealth, the ways of educating and the culture are not the same.)So making a comparison of IQ between countries is absurd because the level of education is simply not the same.Knowing that IQ is strongly related to education (which can allow up to an increase of 10 points).Roland Fryer \& Steven Levitt have tried to identify the variables explaining the "SAT \textbf{Black}-White Gap" (which should remain constant if the intellectual and logical abilities of blacks do not change and are therefore genetic) by analyzing a sample of 20,000 children aged between 5 and 6 years \textbf{old}. By controlling for many social-economic factors, as well as taking into account a large number of control variables such as parents' \textbf{age}, number of books at home, birth weight, participation in WIC nutrition, the number of spankings given by the parents, the security level of the residential area, etc. The authors showed that the gap between \textbf{black} children and white children closed, ie the \textbf{race} has no causal impact on the SAT score.For example, in one of the tables dealing only with the relationship between SAT score and \textbf{race}, the "\textbf{Black}" coefficient is significant, negative and high (-0.638, \textbf{y\textbf{e\textbf{llow}}} in the table) showing a clear difference between the score of whites and that of blacks in mathematics. On the other hand, by including a large number of control variables, the "\textbf{Black}" coefficient was divided by 6 to -0.102 (difference becoming nonsignificant and derisory). [LINK] (Besides, the book \textbf{Race}, Education and Behavior still continues to be a reality.) (90), a \textbf{black} man living with his biological family (80), where the wealth  health, the ways of educating and cultivating, as mentioned earlier, are not the same.)So the socio-economic context strongly impact performance gaps in logic tests such as IQ until they can be strongly reduced (divided by 6 times) and brought to a non-significant difference.IQ, as a test of logic and memory, is therefore strongly linked to the socio-economic context (to divide the differences by 6 and to make them non-significant).Also, culture, and more precisely acculturation and infuence of culture promoting/not promoting hard work and great performance in logical aptitudes (as the dilemma between Confucianism/Chinese Buddhism and American popular culture) can largely explain the difference to logical performance.In 1971, Mercer classified IQ scores for Mexican and \textbf{African} American children by level of acculturation and influence cutlure. Between the the highest levels of acculturation and cutlure influence, Mexican children showed a difference of ~6 points (84.5 to 104.4) and \textbf{African} American children showed a difference of ~8 points (82.7 to 99.5).IQ, as a test of logic and memorization, is therefore strongly linked to culture and its influences and to aculturation (which can allow up to an increase of 20 points). [LINK] Finally, stereotype threat, one of the most important effects, can explain almost completely the difference of performances during a study according to measure the intelligence of the people, as during the studies done by TheBellCurve or \textbf{Race}, Education and Behavior, its effect is simple:When you have to pass an intelligence test where you are in the position of "threat" (it's told to you that the test that you will take into account measure your intelligence, and that this test takes into account your \textbf{ethnicity}), you will immediately look for all the stereotypes that are related to the supposed intelligence of your \textbf{race}, and if your \textbf{race} is considered "less intelligent", you will stress and you will not stop thinking about it by saying that "I have to do everything to avoid showing that I can be potentially less intelligent ", which will make you commit more errors of attentions, in addition to taking a longer time to answer questions, and that will lead you to have actually less good results.This test was conducted on American academics, white and \textbf{black}, by Claude Steele and Aranson, and the results are exactly those expected by the theory (= When the individuals were subject to it, Blacks brought on average less good results than Whites, and when individuals were not subject to them, Blacks and Whites averaged the same results.) [LINK] This study was also done between Whites and Latinos, and Whites and Asians and shows the same result: [LINK] In conclusion, all these effects, which have never been taken into account in TheBellCurve, independently show an almost perfect rebalance of the IQ scores between populations; normally impossible if the intelligence is fixed and is due, in large part, to a hypothetical genetic factor.Taken together, the cutlure, the socio-economic context, the education and the threat of the stereotype completely explain the differences in IQ between population, and the fact that there are no differences in intelligence between populations.IQ varies when it should not be if it really represented intelligence, so it does not represent the intelligence but just the logical performance of a person influenced by his knowledge and his emotional state at a time T, and therefore can not predict anything since these are all aspects that vary the IQ and not the other way around.And this conclusion is more than logical, since we all have the same genes, so far no gene has been found to be correlated with IQ, and that is badly misleading to all our evolutionary theories and our advances in the brain.Indeed, how can the congenial abilities between populations in the human species vary if they do not vary among other individuals of other species of the animal world? (It does not vary, for example, for dogs or chimpanzees where the individuals of these species are much more genetically distant from each other than to the individuals of our species.)How this genetic factor could exist then the research on the brain has demonstrated on the contrary its "placticity" and the fact that it is a muscle: the fact that the memory and the reason depend on the neuronal connections which are created instantaneously with each experience lived or learned, and which can be maintained by repeated experience or regular learning, and therefore almost completely dependent on the environment?How could this genetic factor still exist when it would be in complete contradiction with the genetic flow, the fact that we have the same genes, and the fact that the current "races" do not absolutely represent the true genetic diversity and are thus distorted ?Finally, as said earlier, IQ is not hereditary since it can be totally rebalanced by the effects mentioned above, does not represent intelligence because it varies (like a simple math test, decently), and intelligence between populations is therefore the same."\textbf{race} realism" therefore absolutely don't contribute to science but much more to obscurantism by emitting hypotheses without (genetic) verifications behind and passing them as absolute truth, and must be considered as it is, \textbf{racism}, as was the pseudo-science of the nineteenth century about "races".Let obscurantism return to obscurity! :)\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African, Age, Black, Ethnicity, Mental, Old, Race, Racism, Yellow & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - Asian (East- China, Japan, Korea, Philippines, Vietnam), Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Nationality - Chinese, Nationality - Japanese, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}28/1534 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.825 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Aesthetic Brah Huh interbreeding? I've given it a bit of thought recently. I know humans tend toward assortative breeding. For me this seems odd since its basically inbreeding. Well that might be slightly hyperbolic, but if you have a given population which only breeds among themselves then you're in essence limiting that populations genetic variety. Breeding outside of the populations allows for more genetic variety.However another way to look at it is in terms of heterogeneity and homogeneity. Asortative breeding would be rather problematic if there was only one or a few populations, however given the size of the human \textbf{race} and this tendency towards inbreeding does however help to ensure that certain traits do not necessarily disappear. You end up with several dinstinct groups with distinct traits, where the alternative would be one large homogeneous group, which overall has little genetic variety. Well I know in general life seems to lean towards heterogeniality, it's how one species can branch off into many species. By ensuring a certain amount of genetic variety is does mean that some part of the species, or it's decendants at least has a change to survive. Mind you it also means that some of those heterogeneous groups likely won't have what it takes to survive. I guess the problem then with the homogeneous approach is that we can't really ensure the best traits get passed on. Like killer-bees, the intent was to have large hardworking money makers, but they ended up with large and very angry bees (in other words take the traits that didn't like). The problem of course is who get's to decide which traits are the best? So yeah I'm not exactly sure which approach is better.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Race & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/286 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.35 \\  \hline

Thus demographically \textbf{African} were never forced to have higher intelligence, by not needing  seasonal farming (and thus by the same token never developed advanced societies). If you put blacks or Abo's in an environment that had such harsh environmental factors, such as European winters, or \textbf{Indian} monsoons, they would evolve to  be smarter, but by the same token also evolve to be more like Indians, or Caucasians, depending on their region. (initially basic primal thinking (being tribal hunters, and warriors rather than passive gatherers) and definite environmental traits (white skin color for vitamin D absorption, and "squinty" Asian eyes for intense snowstorms on Mongolian  steppes) while blacks stuck in their continent of plenty where their only threat was other tribes, didn't need  to develop advanced technologies, ideas and societies, they just looked at Animals, and smashed each other with rocks. Eventually through trade, ore advanced ideas came to them, like farming, however they werent forced to farm, and so hunters, and tribals still thrived.

You see, scientifically, it is very much true that there really isn't such a thing as \textbf{race}.  We are all similar enough to be all encompassed in one sub-species.  However, when most average people refer to "\textbf{race}," they're not referring to it in the scientific way.  Instead, they're simply referring to the amount of melanin in someone's skin.  Someone with no melanin is "Albino," someone with a little bit is "White," and someone with a lot is "\textbf{Black}."  \textbf{Racism} isn't really "\textbf{racism}."  It is really just "melaninism," because most people simply call the amount of melanin in your skin "\textbf{race}."And second, YOU ARE BORN \textbf{RACIST} (or "melaninist"). The reason for this is simply instinct.  Think: if you were a member of an ancient hunter-gatherer tribe, and you saw another tribe that was a completely different color, YOU WOULD BE WORRIED.  Maybe not terrified, but aware and worried.  People do in fact learn \textbf{racism}, but they don't learn it from scratch.  However, many interracial children are not born \textbf{racist}, because their "clan" (their family) is already made of more than one "\textbf{race}."Saying you can only learn \textbf{racism} is ignorant, and frankly, wrong.  I am firmly, FIRMLY against \textbf{racism} today, but unfortunately I wasn't always like this.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Wow alot of this "Science" is either wrong, or misrepresented. First off, she uses the term \textbf{race} to mean "subspecies" which is a big \textbf{fat} strawman. Guess what? Scientists use words like "clines", "Populations", and "clades" when classifying humans based on geographic ancestry which means the exact same thing as the layman term "\textbf{race}" as the term "\textbf{race}" is intentionally avoided due to its controversial nature. So she essentially says \textbf{race} doesnt exist, but human populations based on geographic ancestry does....which is the same thing as \textbf{race}. Just because a term has a crude and unspecific definition doesnt mean the entire concept doesnt exist.Secondly, there's no such thing as biological \textbf{race}, but then she goes on to talk about how humans evolved differently and how there's supposedly little genetic variation in humans? So which is it? Are humans exactly the same, or are they not. Talk about back pedalling.Regarding actual genetic variation between races: Studies have shown that Fst distance between human "populations" are of "medium" distance and the distance is around 0.1 to 0.15. However, that 0.12-0.15 is enough to be categorized as a "medium" genetic distance. It takes an Fst of around 0.5 for two organisms to be considered completely different species and 0.25 to be officially be categorized as a sub-species. Think about that.The last thing that is scientifically misrepresented is inbreeding and outbreeding depression. While its true that too close of a genetic distance causes genetic disorders, too much is just as bad. The science of hybrid vigour is  based on agricultural techniques of cross-breeding plants. However, this crossing is HIGHLY SELECTED for. So essentially, humans purposely select which plant yields to breed based on their genetic characteristics. Gee, doesnt that sound kinda like....\textbf{eugenics} (for plants). And the thing is that farmers never pollinate the hybrids. They only breed the pures. That is to say,  hybrids only last for the first generation as the effects of outbreeding depression start to show in generations past the first one. Since the theory of hybrid vigour is based solely on non-humans, then let's use the examples of mules and ligers as a theory on outbreeding depression. Ligers and mules are genetic dead ends with an abundance of genetic problems to boot. They are the result of breeding two organisms too "far" away from each other. This example in nature shows the perils of outbreeding depression in as much as corn crops shows the benefits of hybrid vigour.As far as studies on actual offspring from interracial relationships, the studies are sparse, but for the ones that do exist, the conclusions point to one direction. Kids from such unions usually fare worse than their pure counterparts. The exact causes are obviously up for debate (social vs. genetics), but one obviously cant conclude that interracial kids are better off when studies show that they are not.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Eugenics, Fat, Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments, Physical Identity - Physical Features & \cellcolor{green!5}8/478 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.674 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I think its important to keep in mind that cognitively the human mind uses heuristics (\textbf{mental} shortcuts) to make decision In fact there is an IAT (Implicit Association Test) which shows how \textbf{racist} we actually are without knowing it (although there is some debate as to the validity of this test).  Every time we behave in a certain way we learn (operant conditioning) through reward and punishment we act a different way. If someone of the opposite \textbf{sex} are perceived as more attractive, we are more willing to help. This in itself is a form of \textbf{racism}. In fact attitudes like the damsel in distress or pretty being good (i.e. disney) are good examples.I think its important to know that our attention can't process all the information it receives simultaneously so we have to use heuristics. This in itself is a form of guessing what might happen. This action in itself called selective attention requires us to not use all of our mind to make decisions. According to Dual process theory, when we use system 1 we make implicit decisions using heuristics. Now as wrong ethically as those decisions may be, if we see one cultural group (\textbf{race}) typically complete one action such as stealing we may implicitly (non consciously) assume that that type of person are the type which commonly behave in that manner (stereotype). For that reason we may using our heuristics assume that one type of \textbf{race} or cultural group typically behave in such a negative manner (discrimination).For these reasons (there may be others) I believe that \textbf{racism} has biological routes from cognetive brain functions (selective attention  System 1  Heuristics) as well as social constructs (ie. a baby boy being given blue clothes and a baby girl being given pink clothes).\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Mental, Race, Racism, Racist, Sex & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General, Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}7/298 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.349 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@l Nero l Well, yes, we are kind of borned to judge what to be wary of. A interesting experiment that was conducted on mice a couple of years ago. A mice got an electric shock each time a beeping sound was triggered, after doing this for a couple of weeks or months or so, the experiment continued on, without the electric shock. Each time the mouse heard the beeping sound, the mouse still reacted as if the mouse got schocked. After the mouse had offsprings, the same beeping sound was made towards the children of the mouse. When the children of the mouse, heard the beeping sound, they reacted the same way the parents did, by twitching as if they were shocked. This proves that things like reactions towards certain things, are genetic. So if your parents where super \textbf{racist}, it is very likely you will be born a \textbf{racist}, even if your parents never tought you to be a \textbf{racist}.

This is a catalyst that bring people to civilization because it divide people into different classes which serves as the first step to feudal economy. I like how you saying that everyone except Europeans had 'decent' army and gathering systems. You obviously don't know that Lacedaemon had first professional army in the world and Europeans were first to fully adopt crop rotation.'Warring with each other'? Are you saying that in this period of time we were only ones to leading wars? You do know China had non-stoppable wars between Dynasties, as well as India and Japan had their own wars? I'm clearly see that you're probably American with \textbf{african} origin and you just can't accept the fact that Europe was the first region to adopt civilization, develop it and bring to the people of other parts of the world.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!5}1/162 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.617 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small 1. I never said it wasn't apart of an civilization. I said that it wasn't Civil. Plus there are plenty of \textbf{old} civilizations that never had slaves. 2. Japan was pretty much done fighting with themselves after the 1600 hundreds when the Tokugawa appeared. And so was China when the Qing stepped in around the same time. 3. if you really don't believe that the Europeans started not only WW1 but most of WW2 then You're an idiot. Hell the Chinese and Japanese part of the war wasn't even called WW2 by them it was called the Second Sino-Japanese war. Since China really wasn't fighting on anyone's side except their own and kind of Russia's. The Lacedaemon were obviously not the first civilization with a professional army since there were several civilization that existed before hand that were in different parts of the world that fought each other over resources and territory probably even humans as well. It's clear you're an idiot most likely of european Decent who doesn't know enough about the history of the rest of the world, outside of Europe, to make a serious argue for his case. The first signs of modern tech, like cameras, actually came from China and so did gunpowder. the Scientific Method? The Middle East. Although Egypt was not the first civilization to use geometry to its advantage it was one of the best. Stonehenge predates that and it could of been made by a European civilization that we simply we don't know about they also used astronomy and other scientific means to map out a few of the stars. That's a possibility that can't be ignore but until we have proof the civilization when could just say it was a tribe that is long past, since plenty of tribes would have a seer or something that would be pretty handy at astronomy if \textbf{nothing} else. Now don't get me wrong, Europeans have done a lot for the world, and to it, just as much if not more than many other groups. But it'd be a stone cold lie if you called any of those civilizations Civil by modern terms and said that Europeans view intelligence over physical prowess. It way more complicated then that.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Scabino Sc. *Sigh* you're annoying one aren't you?1. American slavery may of been one of the last things to end. But that slave trade from South Africa to the Americas and into your precious Europe was started in the 1300s. The Ancient slaves were no better off than the \textbf{African} slaves except for the fact they didn't seem to be picky on who was to be a slave. So i don't think it was racially biased, but then again i guess the real question is which ancient slaves are we talking about? (in which again i didn't mention anything about it being AMERICAN slaves, you put that in there i just said that slavery was a uncivilized way of doing things. Keep it together now and pay attention.) I agreed with you on the term of Democracy, i don't know where you're argument is there for i'm the one who brought it up, but even the Ancient's Democracy's were not civil since it took the rights away from women and those not of the people and of different countries as well as slaves of course. And excused me? Stole? Uh i didn't ask for your precision Democracy( although i do like it for the time being), Guess who brought "Democracy" to the whole world? The same people who brought Christianity to the whole world of course! Isn't that wonderful? (see the sarcasm? IF not then give up. If so then let's continue).Once again you're simplifying things too much, and not seeing the big issue here. The US sold to both sides, they didn't care because they didn't want to get involve unless it meant a profit. The USSR may have signed a pact with Germany but it was just a sham meant to just keep them off each other after Poland fell long enough for Hitler to fall for that scorched earth policy. And your China and Japan argument is flawed too... While China was dealing with the constant bickering of the Nationalist versus the \textbf{Communist} as well as the Rape of Nanking, Japan was dealing with how it was going to hold its islands and dealing with Korea. Not to mention the totalitarianism of Japan's military, \textbf{nobody} was entirely unified in that fight although Japan did put up a good one. China never walled itself off, except that one time when it did but that was a long time ago, you have to think about how China did things back then. I don't care to get into the details so here's the basics China did not need anything the UK or anyone else in Europe was trying to trade with them. So that resorted in the UK having to use silver to trade with for their items. When the UK got the opium from India they got their leverage. and everything fell apart then. Japan wasn't completely walled off either they traded with Denmark and the eastern countries and open their gates when China got their ass kicked by the UK, to the US and other countries. Ever wondered why some movies based in the late 1800s has some reference to Asian minorities? Mainly because they kind of had an exodus to try to educate them in the Western Style of learning, which is true was the better one at the time. but you know what everything i just said doesn't matter. Why? because you just proved my point about your lack in knowledge about any of the countries.USSR? European. America in it's "hay day" Mostly European with its own hatred towards the same people they were enslaving and mistreatment and no don't just mean Africans (idiot). In both Wars how did they start? A European alliance system that was broken from the start just waiting for something stupid to happen or for someone simple to manipulate it. And even worse this is still not my Original argument. ALL I WAS FUCKING SAYING YOU BLOODY IDIOT WAS THAT CULTURES AND RACES ARE NOT THAT SIMPLE TO JUST ASSIGN A WANT FOR ANY PARTICULAR ATTRIBUTE. That's all i was saying, I was not trying to get into a spat about how shitty Europe was, I was not trying to get into a spat about how amazing everything else in comparison (Because it was no better).

To ignore what the Aztec did, or what the Spanish did later is simply not a valid way to look at Mexican history.  The Mexican Revolution  of 1915 was a failed venture as had been the case with earlier risings including the Rebellion Against Spain be it that of 1810 or that of September, 1821.  Even the small things won have since been lost, but,  in  no case was equality won.   I could ask what is your father's first language, but, this should not get personal.  If there was no discrimination against Indians in Mexico, then there would not be numerous tribes striving for equality and justice.

I couldn't understand why people were \textbf{racist}; coming from an educated city with very low poverty.  10 years ago we moved to her hometown, and I began to understand.  It's not the fear of the unknown... it's our instinct to no longer trust people who share characteristics of individuals who have harmed us in the past.  Unfortunately, \textbf{black} people are set up for failure, in this country.  Less opportunities and generations of distrust and mistreatment have majorly impacted the poverty rates... which in turn creates criminals.  Then those criminals harm us, so we protect ourselves by making judgments based on race/appearance.  Past experiences mold us into who we are, today.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@PrankHubTV Here is something someone else posted: "The idea that \textbf{race} has \textbf{nothing} to do with biology is not tenable. A competent researcher can look at someone's genome, or skeleton, and predict their \textbf{race} with a high degree of accuracy. The fact that everyone's genome is 99.9 the same doesn't change the fact that there are large differences. That .1 amounts to, on average, 3 million base pair differences between a pair of individuals. A difference of a single base pair can cause a significant difference. For instance, the genetic disease sickle cell anemia is caused by a mutation in a single base pair. The video mentions subspecies but fails to tell the audience that human races are more genetically distant from each-other than many subspecies among other animals are. I think that is a pretty important fact to bring up when discussing the reality of \textbf{race}. The discussion of \textbf{race} differences in disease rate is also lacking because it ignores the fact that some of these differences have clear genetic bases. For instance, because of a high frequency of a specific gene variant \textbf{African} Americans have more sensitive androgen receptors than other Americans and this is part, though not all, of why they have high rates of prostate cancer. To give a second example, there was recently a study that found that two gene variants known to put people at risk for diabetes are more \textbf{common} among the Mexican population than among the American population. The discussion of clines is also problematic. A Cline refers to a situation in which a trait changes very gradually and as a function of geographical distance. Skin color, which changes very gradually as populations move away from the equator, is a \textbf{common} example of this. But not all human genetic variation is clinal. There are sharp discontinuities in how gene frequencies changes across populations. This is why if you compare three populations that are all equally distance from each-other in terms of geography the two that are within the same \textbf{race} will be more similar genetically. Racial categories are artifacts of culture in the sense that they are categories that humans invent. But they are categories that group people based on real biological differences and are no less valid than any other category used in biology, all of which were invented by humans."\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}African, Common, Nothing, Race & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}9/390 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.308 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small "\textbf{Race}" doesn't scientifically exist because it is often arbitrary (Irish and Italians weren't considered whites for a long time)\textbf{Ethnicity} absolutely does. Not talking about \textbf{ethnicity} is actively confounding the situation.Furthermore, the genetic differences are not the major factor in "\textbf{racism}". It's cultural conflict. You can't deny that Kurds for example have their own unique culture, identity and history. There is "racial" conflict between Kurds and the groups they live with because they are forced to live together, in spite of conflicting ideological values, rules, and ideals specific to their separate \textbf{ethnic} cultures. It was for this same reason that India fought for self determination and home rule against the British, and why it later split into Pakistan, India and Bangladesh due to irreconcilable cultural differences and violent conflict.Saying that all people can live together in harmony just by being tolerant is a purely western construct with no basis in reality or history. It ignores the diversity it claims to protect by trivializing the disparity in values and beliefs it pretends to understand, and becomes confused when South Asia and the Middle East are violently tearing themselves apart due to "\textbf{racism}", or when well educated, tolerant Europeans want to keep migrants out.You can be friendly and understanding of your neighbors, but it is hard to live with them under the same roof, or force one another to follow the same rules.Finally, this is not to say that "\textbf{racism}" and racial violence is okay, but rather that you have misunderstood the basis of \textbf{ethnic} conflict as a genetic one when it is a cultural one.P.S.

Probably the biggest factor was having to plan ahead in preparation for the onset of winter, which Africans never had to do.

The lack of resources in the the cold northern climates would have made acquiring food and mates by force a necessity. The fact that your ancestors bred with Neanderthal but most only retain 1-4 of  DNA, the fact that the bones of your ancestors suddenly appear and places where neanderthal bones disappear and the fact there have been neanderthal ruins found that were actively destroyed your ancestors and, of course, the drinking of milk - something that killed a great meany of your ancestors before they adapted to it and they still kept doing it - tells a story of a people who were desperate, violent, appropriating and territorial. It is of little surprise there were no farms in Europe until long after they existed in Africa and Asia. Likewise current research clearly shows that the lack sunlight would have effected your ancestors the way it does today. Living in darker, cold climates with long winters would have lead to widespread depression and violence was sure to follow; there is a reason Norway gave birth to both Vikings and "\textbf{black} metal".In contrast, the fertility of Africa and the Middle East is precisely what gave raise the Ancient World. A world that was flourishing with art, culture, mathematics and the sciences long, long before the Europeans had mastered agriculture. Remember Egyptian civilization was as \textbf{old} to Ancient Rome as Ancient Rome is to us now. By the time Rome marched on Europe, Europeans were still in primitive bronze aged tribes.

Also correlation does not mean causation, having a harsher climate doesn't mean the weather will magically sharpen your intelligence but it's the fact that in this climates you have to think how you would respond to make better decisions and survive, in a mild climate you don't need to make such decisions so often.You want to call exceptions a rule and that's your problem.

First I'm going to tell you that it has been proven that Neanderthals at that time were a \textbf{race} that could have the same intelligence as modern humans.Second, farming requires more thought because even if it's not so active like hunting it definitely needs a way to predict how to manage your food and used it the right way, you have to give it protection, make sure it grows healthy then calculate how many you would have for later. It's even more complicated than hunting.Third, a mexican would feel more sick in that climate because even if it was raised in russia  probably wouldn't have the same immune system a russian person have, it isn't in their genes in the first place to cope with such a cold.Finally, all your arguments seem to stand from the point that you simply wouldn't like one \textbf{race} being more intelligent than another. Why? I don't exactly know but why it scares you to accept that different human beings are different than others in almost all matters? not in how we define ourselves as humans but what we can do as humans. I'll tell you this because I have a feeling this may be why you're so angry at the idea: Intelligence doesn't mean superiority, many people put it that way but in reality the concept of ''better'' doesn't mean anything at the end than a mere preference, just that. Not everyone it's the same, and denying human protection to others because they are different it's fuck up but trying to be \textbf{blind} to what different communities of \textbf{race} can do different in the same environment its immature.I think you would like the idea of a perfect world where everyone has the same \textbf{mental} capabilities and personality because then manage society as a whole would be a lot more easy but like all things in life this is more complicated than that. We have to think how to manage different sectors of society and I'm not saying we will collapse as a whole if we don't do it but inner relationship in a region with different races can be disturbed by the fact that not everybody thinks or acts that same way, like I said before \textbf{race} it's like a big family but with even a more varied gene pool so the people in this certain \textbf{race} are predisposed to act more similar than let's say with another \textbf{race} that have a different location, ancestry and a history of dealing with problems rather different in some aspects.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Blind, Mental, Race & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}8/434 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.843 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Bryan Jared 1. Ha no. The Neanderthals were definitely not as intelligent as homo sapiens at the time. They and Homo Habilis (another one of our hominid cousins in Asian region) were outcompeted by us partially thanks to our greater intellect. Were they intelligent? Yes. But it's likely that they didn't even possess language nor had the same abstract thought capabilities that modern humans do. They had brains that were similar size to us, but size doesn't mean everything. For example the part of the brain that handles eyesight for the Neanderthals was far bigger then our own. Similar overall size, but not similar size for all parts of the brain. 2. Farming while being a skill that requires some intelligence doesn't exactly give you the same rich diet as a more meat focused diet. For example one of the reasons that hominid's brain size increased was due to our early hominid ancestors switching to a more meat heavy diet. One could argue that because the Africans had a more meat heavy diet, this encouraged larger brain growth due to the richer diet.3. Immune system? First and foremost in a place as cold as Russia I highly doubt that contagious diseases are a \textbf{common} thing (I could be wrong here, but I have my doubts). Second, resistance to diseases are based mostly on prenatal environments then just simply pure genetics. A Mexican mother who stayed in Russia for awhile and then gave birth in that country would have a child that would more or less, have the same resistances as the other native born Russians.4. I don't like the idea of people using Evolutionary Psychology to push junk science. I've seen this type of attitude increasing a lot. Everything you do has some evolutionary justification behind it. Women like to shop for shoes? "It's because women were typically gathers back in the pre-agricultural period!". Men like to play golf? "It's because it's close to throwing spears!". The likely explanation it could be is that men and women just like different things based on cultural values. But NOPE! Has to be some sort of hardwired instinct.Evolutionary Psychology has it's place, but it's been so overused (both in the past and now in the present) that I fear it's one day going to collapse under it's own bull shit and hurt public opinion on Evolution.This whole "certain races are smarter then others" is just another case of bullshit Evolutionary Psychology. Because the fact of the matter is that we can literally conjure any explanation we want to say why X \textbf{race} is smarter then Y \textbf{race}. Also this whole thing when you really boil it down, just turns into the "Blacks are poorer and do less well on SAT tests because they're the dumbest \textbf{race}". Which often times ignores the plethora of other just as good explanations.The whole concept of racial differences is intelligence is stupid due to the fact that racial genotypes are absurdly similar to each other. Human \textbf{race} only evolved from a small tribe in South Eastern Africa. We didn't have a lot of genetic diversity to begin with to even result in their being vast differences between us. Why do you think the human cultures/races are so similar to each other? We all smile. We all cry. We all kiss.Even culturally we're similar to each other. The vast majority of cultures have a similar ideal as to what a man should do and what a female should do. We all value bravery. We value family. We believe in some higher spiritual power. Even our creation myths and mythical heroes are similar to each other. There is more similarities in an \textbf{African} tribesman and an Asian human being then there is between an Asian \textbf{monkey} and an \textbf{African} \textbf{monkey}.We have all of these similarities but people like you obsess over the differences. Especially the differences between intelligence. When you actually step a back and look you realize just how petty and insignificant the differences are in the grand scheme of things. This isn't just the rambling of some guy on YouTube. Scientists themselves have said that \textbf{race} is mostly just arbitrary. Yet we still have people like you that think the different races are so varied that they have different levels of intelligence? Based on what?? One \textbf{race} farmed more then another \textbf{race}? Or lived in colder weather? These aren't even obvious explanations you're literally coming to a conclusion and just looking for evidence to back up said conclusion (which is backwards).Hell there hasn't even been that many different races for a long time! It's only been a few tens of thousands of years and people are already thinking that the \textbf{race} is just another term for sub-species.tldr; Thinking that the different races have different levels of intelligence is lazy thinking, unscientific, and neglects the fact that the different races are extremely similar to each other both culturally, physically, and psychologically. To say they're different intellectually when they are barely different from each other in the other regards is just another way of pushing forward an agenda of racial superiority. It's likely that if we had this conversation three hundred years ago.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Skyrim Guard How it's that what I've said make people believe in the superiority of a \textbf{race}? I said that even the concept of superiority was much more likely a social construct based on the preference of a community. Social construct it's all based on that, how you should behave, what you would like and preferene it's based in the things we have to deal with and our limited human mind trying to make everything fit.I didn't say the difference between races was abysmal, probably if people from different places wouldn't have encounter each other in another thousands of years then the differences would be enough to call it another subspecies but you can see the difference are mostly physical and not so much psychological, and it's exactly that what I'm telling you to get in your mind, even if the difference it's minimum you have to accept it also plays a role.I told you so, you're so angry that you only focus on the parts that are against your ideology. \textbf{Race} doesn't mean we are completely different, it's not enough to segregate society based on that, it's a lot of factors that make interacting with different people difficult, not just \textbf{race}.Telling me it's all a social construct without a purpose it's like saying it's completely the fault of \textbf{race} that cause all of our problems, that truly is arbitrary. We all came from Africa so it's not hard to think we behave this similar even with people from a different \textbf{race}. Natural selection needs more time than what we had in the history of humanity coming from Africa to the rest of the world to make a significant change but this doesn't mean it didn't make anything different, even if the change it's subtle it's still there. ''I don't like the idea of people using Evolutionary Psychology to push junk science'' It's the best we have, sir. It obviouly wasn't magic the one that shaped our way to see the world, and yeah this way of explaining things has many flaws but it's better than claiming something it's the cause because you like it that way.You have also said that the brains of neanderthals were of the same size but were most likely not in the same line modern human brains are in the context of intelligence but then you said that because africans where hunting and digesting meat that would be enough to make the mass of the brain bigger and make them even more intelligent. Decided please, kiddo. Here's the thing, the mass of a brain doesn't correlate directly with intelligence, that's a fact. It's needed more than that, don't be simplistic.Finally, no. Neglecting the fact that we are not all in the same page and that this is due to social status, morality, education and also \textbf{race} it's truly lazy thinking.

First and foremost while mass does not necessarily mean more intelligent, there is in fact a correlation between them. Early hominids got bigger brains, and in order to compensate for this increased mass they needed more energy, so they hunted more, this increase in meat rich diet, which may have resulted in an even further increase in brain size (It's a chicken or the egg first scenario).Also I was only using the African's "bigger brains by eating meat" as a way to RIDICIULE your notion that because Europeans had a colder climate and had to think more about how to survive the winter, that's why they're smarter.Also please don't try and come at me with that "I'm not saying one \textbf{race} is inferior, i'm just saying we're different" bullshit.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@DaveDangerous74OK so if inbreeding is bad, because the population is too genetically close.No. I meant what I wrote please don't paraphrase me as there is a difference in what I said that was important for you to understand: inbreeding is problematic because it impedes the process that would normally correct genetic errors. In time, yes, this would be bad for a population but the pertinent concern is that increases the chances of hereditary disease and dysfunction. So when Bill Clinton does his "all human beings are 99.9 the same" That is just misleading.  People are genetically different and that does have real world consequences.It's actually 99.5 but what he meant was not misleading. The simple fact is humans are far too closely related for our own good. More importantly though, the level of differences in humans is not sufficient to claim any population of humans is genetically distinct enough to be called another \textbf{race}.Do you think that people can be genetically too dissimilar to breed with.  In the same way that you can be too near bred, can you be too far bred?No, and again, this is part of why I'll ask you not to paraphrase me. There is no such thing as too close to breed. You can become sterile as a result of too many accumulated dysfunctions cause by inbreeding but there are no homo sapiens sapiens that can be so genetically different from each other as to make mating impossible as we all descend from less than 1000 breeding pairs of ancestors.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/260 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.385 \\  \hline

However these are due to simply adapting to environmental changes due to the different climates. The human species didn't somehow split into a various different subspecies over the course of the course of a few tens of thousands of years. We all still have the same damn brain. That's why we are all psychologically and behaviorally the same. You're trying to tell me that blacks are less intelligent then whites because we have different brains. Yet we're also the same both psychologically and behaviorally? Wouldn't it make far more sense for us to deviate from each other in those regards instead of just in intelligence? Our physical differences aren't because human beings split into sub-species of each other (which is what, whether you know it or not, are trying to argue). Our physical differences are \textbf{nothing} more then quick environmental adaptions due to the differences in climate. The differences races weren't split long enough for their to be anymore significant variations. Maybe if the races were split for an extra 50,000 or maybe even a 100,000 years. We would of had more of a disparity between the races. Second, the differences in IQ have already been attributed to the fact that many Africans both within their continent and outside of it live in poverty. Seeing as upbringing makes up around for 25 of somebody's intelligence, that is a far better explanation for the gap in IQ instead of just simply "blacks are dumber then whites because of genetics". I'm starting to get tired of this comment thread.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Mani Tati UGH! I accidentally deleted my last comment so I now I have to rewrite the whole damn thing. sigh This is pointless, i'm just endlessly arguing with people on YouTube comments section. This is going to be my last post and then i'm done.First and foremost your argument(s) is flawed in multiple ways and I'm going to break it down piece by piece to tell you why.1. "Again, ALL studies on intelligence have proven that different races have substantial IQ differences, after adjusting for your usual cry arguments of 'poverty' and such. Blacks and whites and asians and others people from the same social background have different IQ ranges. As well as other psychological and behavioral differences caused by their different genetic makeup."A) First and foremost you're confusing studies that measure IQ between races with the same socioeconomic status, but those studies don't necessarily factor in wholesale upbringing. Studies have already shown that the upbringing in a middle class/Upper class \textbf{black} family is NOT the same as the upbringing in a middle class/upper class white family. [LINK] To quote the above article for your convenience"A superior adoption study — and one not discussed by the hereditarians — was carried out at Arizona State University by the psychologist Elsie Moore, who looked at \textbf{black} and mixed-\textbf{race} children adopted by middle-class families, either \textbf{black} or white, and found no difference in I.Q. between the \textbf{black} and mixed-\textbf{race} children. Most telling is Dr. Moore's finding that children adopted by white families had I.Q.'s 13 points higher than those of children adopted by \textbf{black} families. The environments that even middle-class \textbf{black} children grow up in are not as favorable for the development of I.Q. as those of middle-class whites."B) If what you said is true, then that would mean that blacks that have  European genetics would in turn have higher IQ points then those who have more \textbf{African} genetics. However studies have shown that this is FALSE. [LINK] "About 25 percent of the genes in the American \textbf{black} population are European, meaning that the genes of any individual can range from 100 percent \textbf{African} to mostly European. If European intelligence genes are superior, then blacks who have relatively more European genes ought to have higher I.Q.'s than those who have more \textbf{African} genes. But it turns out that skin color and 'negroidness' of features — both measures of the degree of a \textbf{black} person's European ancestry — are only weakly associated with I.Q. (even though we might well expect a moderately high association due to the social advantages of such features)."C) We are all psychologically and behaviorally the same. There is not a single study out there that can definitely say "Blacks are more likely to do X because of Whites, because their genetics are different". Why? Because not only is testing for something like that outright impossible to do in any ethical regard. One would have to raise multiple different races of children in an enclosed environment with absolutely NO outside influences and study their behavior throughout their entire life spans. The different races have different experiences in life due to the way our society functions. Seeing as no test like the above has ever been done, for you to outright say that blacks, whites, and Asians are genetically predisposition to act in a certain way that is distinctive from each other is, at BEST, not testable.D) Some studies have shown the exact OPPOSITE of what you just said. That \textbf{black} kids raised in white homes ended up outperforming white kids adopted in white homes. The fact of the matter is that \textbf{race} and intelligence is a hotly debated topic because multiple statistics have flaws in them that simply cannot be overcome." Another study, of \textbf{black} West \textbf{Indian} (Caribbean) children and English children raised in an orphanage in England, found that the Caribbean children had higher IQs than those from England, with mixed-\textbf{race} children scoring in between. But were the \textbf{black} children given more attention by orphanage staff? Were particularly intelligent Caribbeans emigrating to England for better economic opportunity?""In fact, it did. Horses and dogs etc have diverged into different subspecies (breeds, races) in a much shorter time span. The Human diversity between races is much larger than in other animal species"You deeply misunderstand dogs and horses. First and foremost dog and horses were ARTIFICIALLY bred by humans to single out the most desirable traits. Humans however were NOT bred in such a concentrated and controlled manner. The reason that the different breeds of dogs and horses arose so wasn't something naturally occurred. Not to mention that horses and dogs are far more effected by their genetics then humans are (who are more impacted by their environment and upbringing).I've looked this shit up before mate. The fact of the matter is that drawing conclusions from studies that measure IQ are flawed. Sometimes it's because different cultures values different forms of intelligence and this may not be what the IQ tests are looking for. Another issue is the fact that many blacks (and women) also suffer from 'Stereotype Threat', and studies have shown that something as simply stating your \textbf{race} on an IQ test can make who are stereotyped as less intelligent (blacks and women) to perform worse on said tests. [LINK] So the problem we have is this. Whites are smarter then blacks (so you claim). Yet blacks with European ancestry don't perform better on IQ tests then those with more pure \textbf{African} ancestry. We have studies that show that orphaned blacks growing up in white homes outperform orphan whites growing up in white homes. We also have studies that state the opposite. We also have IQ scores which may or may not have cultural bias (which is why you can have tests in Gwana that have the average \textbf{black} male to have an IQ of around 70, which is \textbf{mental} retardation and quite obviously far to low for any average human population regardless of \textbf{race}.)What makes these arguments even more stupid is that you guys have yet to make a single good argument as to even WHY whites are smarter then blacks.If what you say is completely and 100 true. How is that even possible? What makes Europeans so unique that they are the "smartest \textbf{race}" on the planet?People like me say it's because Europeans have, for the last few centuries, had the most wealth and opportunities and thanks to living in such rich environments and having a culture that tends to focus more on education and academics, that's why they out perform other races. NOT because Europeans are simply genetically predisposition to being smarter. People like you say. Europeans outperform other races because we (I say we because people who say Whites are smarter then blacks are usually white themselves) are simply genetically gifted with more intelligence then other races.While my approach to the IQ and academic gap takes into account the process that could lead to the disparity. Your approach only cares about the results. Which is why your arguments are ultimately flawed. Because you look at the results and go with the easiest and most self congratulatory explanations. While I on the other hand keep in mind the numerous other factors that could lead to said result.The fact that we have such a huge number of highly intelligent blacks is already proof enough that genetics themselves aren't the answer as to why there is a gap. However people like you wish to shun away from the difficulties of understanding \textbf{race} and intelligence and instead opt for the easy answer.Welp i'm done with this thread.

However studies have shown that this is FALSE. "False: B.1) your own quote says " are only weakly associated with I.Q."! 'weakly' associated is enough to show a significant variance on a Normal distribution (i..e the bell curve) B.2) Again, Your OWN source states:"The hereditarians begin with the assertion that 60 percent to 80 percent of variation in I.Q. is genetically determined. However, most estimates of heritability have been based almost exclusively on studies of middle-class groups."middle class is a much better control group for IQ that the poor, obviously.. if you want to rule out environmental factors B.3) That NYT article seems totally bogus. It says: "men and women score the same, on average, on I.Q. tests" which is very misleading. There are IMMENSE variations on IQ between the sexes, even though the averages may be close (but not equal), the variance (standard deviation) is very different. Men are more likely to have both very low or very high IQ. Women cluster in the middle IQ. And the article has no sources. It is completely biased, and it's written by and based on the work on a single guy who has a personal crusade to 'prove' its conclusion. Typical case of going from the conclusion to the required picked facts to prove it. The author doesn't even consider for a second different explanations for those supposed results. Biased pseudo-science at its best. B.4) Your own logical implication is not correct, because genes act in various ways, and white-\textbf{black} hybrids may cause a recessive trait on IQ.Funnily enough, my personal experience is the opposite: the smartest blacks i've met were all mixed \textbf{race}. And i've met many RICH full blacks, so it was not due to social class. Not one of the rich pure blacks was smart.C) "We are all psychologically and behaviorally the same. There is not a single study out there that can definitely say "Blacks are more likely to do X because of Whites, because their genetics are different""Wrong. Here's a study for the well-known higher violence of blacks:MAOA gene:  [LINK]  [LINK] " \textbf{African} American subjects were considered separately. The allele frequencies for white and \textbf{African} American are shown inTable 1. As has been reported previously, allele frequency rates differ  between the 2 populations" [LINK] "New analyses of the human genome have established that human evolution has been recent, copious, and regional."" In each of these races, a different set of genes has been changed by natural selection. This is just what would be expected for populations that had to adapt to different challenges on each continent. The genes specially affected by natural selection control not only expected traits like skin color and nutritional metabolism, but also some aspects of brain function"Even TIME magazine admits that \textbf{Race} influences psychology and behavior [LINK] "Racial groups differ much more widely than many people realize. Yet vocal groups in academia and the media simply forbid letting the public in on an open discussion."The famous survey of Richard Lynn on global, which actually gave Asians ~10 IQ points above whites. So much for english bias and such.D) "That \textbf{black} kids raised in white homes ended up outperforming white kids adopted in white homes."Name any serious and non-biased study that concluded that. If the \textbf{black} kids were pre-selected or had other motivations, that invalidates the studyE) "dog and horses were ARTIFICIALLY bred by humans to single out the most desirable traits"Ok, so you want natural selection with no human interference? Here's a few animal subspecies that are LESS diverse than human subspecies (dogs are actually more diverse it seems):"the Canadian lynx, the \textbf{African} Buffalo, The Plain Zebra, and the \textbf{R\textbf{ed}} Winged \textbf{Black} Bird."Were these artificially bred by humans? no.How long did they take to diversify? Less than the 150 000 years that humans had. 150 000 years is a LOT of time to branch out into diverse subspecies, especially when that evolution happens in very different environmentsF) "What makes Europeans so unique that they are the "smartest \textbf{race}" on the planet?"I never said we were. Asians and Ahkzenazhi Jews on average have higher IQ, and other smaller peoples----------Stop being a hypocrite and face the truth: most scientists don't want to study \textbf{race} becuase it's a politically incorrect taboo and they are simply AFRAID of being targeted and attacked for it.Like those Nobel laureates that were expelled and lost their jobs for defending science and peaking the truth.

Racial differences are found between ALL races. It's theses differences that define them as separate and distinct races (i.e. subspecies).This is what Darwin said, in 7th chapter of  The Decent of Man:"There is, however, no doubt that the various races, when carefully compared and measured, differ much from each other,- as in the texture of the hair, the relative proportions of all parts of the body,* the capacity of the lungs, the form and capacity of the skull, and even in the convolutions of the brain.But it would be an endless task to specify the numerous points of  difference.

It has been called an amalgamation of bad biology and inexcusable anthropology.In 2005, Lisa Suzuki and Joshua Aronson of New York University wrote an article noting that Rushton ignored evidence that failed to support his position that IQ test score gaps represent a genetic racial hierarchy. He did not change his position on this matter for 30 years.[66] Rushton replied in the same issue of the journal.Rushton ignored things such as systematic/institutional discrimination, racial profiling, economic disparities and unequal access to judicial defense in his attempt to apply r/K Theory and IQ theories to explain racial disparities in American crime rates. Rushton has spoken on \textbf{eugenics} several times at conferences of the American Renaissance magazine, a monthly racialist magazine, in which he has also published a number of general articles.In a paper for the International Journal of Selection and Assessment in 2006, Steven Cronshaw and colleagues wrote that psychologists need to critically examine the science used by Rushton in his "\textbf{race}-realist" research. Their re-analysis of the validity criteria for test bias, using data reported in the Rushton et al. paper, led them to conclude that the testing methods were biased against \textbf{Black} Africans.

The suicide rate in Japan is very high because kids and teens feel like failures when they do bad in school and some who dont commit suicide can become Hikikimori and lock themselves away from society. Thats how important education is in Japan. That explains the higher iq average it is their culture to be career oriented so they focus on education. Its not genetic its their state of mind that makes them become smart. Now lets compare physical capabilities of blacks. Many blacks in certain communities think the only way to become successful is sports or entertainment. And many will prioritize athletics over education. I believe a \textbf{black} person isn't physically superior to a white person and a white person isn't genetically smarter. Different interest, communities, diets, etc breed different results.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Dogs are sort of a unique case in the animal kingdom as they are the product of breeding, selected by humans.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Alex xeon First off, "breed" and "\textbf{race}"...two different things. Secondly, breeds were developed due to selective breeding, and before that, many many many years of adaptation to their environment. Humans were separated by their environment but it didn't last thousands of years. We migrated around, ice bridges melted, we got separated, then made boats and intermingled again. Adaptation occurred but not enough that it led to different breeds or "types" like with other animals. That's why all humans still act so similar, feel the same, are physically and psychologically the same in every aspect. The only thing that is different is skin pigmentation and facial differences, which is more diverse from person to person than between races.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Well you're assuming that they could afford that. which granted many were rich but that required too much time and money to select people, breed them, wait for the kids to grow up to see if there was a strong trait carried over, and then do it again, and again....and again... Granted slavery lasted a long time but it was more cost effective, and less time consuming to just buy slaves that matched what they wanted. I'm not saying it never happened but it would be extremely unlikely if it lasted long, well alone long enough for it to affect the entire \textbf{black} community in America. Romans had slaves and gladiators too but the people of their slaves aren't known as extremely strong, fast etc. people. Not anymore than average humans\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!5}1/131 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.763 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Alex xeon Ok, number one, actually it does. How do you think genetic variation occurs? evolution literally is adaptation. It is the survival of those with the best surviveability of their environment. We chose mates based on the likelyhood of survival! Chose has everything to do with evolution! Watch Discovery channel or some animal documentaries. Whenever they talk about mating they always say they "select" and "choose" a mate. The only other time variations occur are due to very mild mutations which don't occur often. And when they do, they are either hidden in the genetic code and cannot be seen through physical characteristics or it was actually advantageous which again doesn't happen often. It's more often just minor mutations that make little difference. Number two, mass immigration had \textbf{nothing} to do with my point. Unique breeds of the same species occur due to 1. an extremely long period of time in an environment, leading to the eventual emergence of adaptations to their environment. 2. Deliberate selective breeding, meaning something, that something being us, came in and stopped natural selection ( something that WE went through because we were able to CHOOSE our mates and the most adaptive survive) and instead only allowed certain members carrying a certain trait to reproduce with another certain member. The key here is that in nature, they fuck whoever they want and the less adaptive die out. in selective, that's not a variable anymore. They were selected based on a task they could perform better than others. Whether that would survive in the wild is a completely other story. and 3. Unique types and breeds only occur in extremely isolated environments with NO INTERACTION WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF THEIR SPECIES FROM OTHER ENVIRONMENTS. That's the point I was making. Yeah there was no mass immigration. BUT people  still had interracial \textbf{sex}, and had offspring. We were only separated long enough to lead to extremely mild adaptations of our environment. Like white people being able to take in more vitamin D and sunlight since northern parts of the world get less sunlight due to clouds and colder climates, while darker skinned people are more protected from the sun. But we quickly interacted again, leading to communication, emotional sharing, mating etc. Further supporting traits that make us human before  they could disappear or alter. And the interaction has only increased over time. Which is why Humans haven't changed since. dark people are in Europe all over. White people are in Africa and Asia. Besides, as I said breeding indicates they have an advanced skill  that others do not have. No science indicates that's the case. But I'll get back on thatThree, wtf read what you just said. "doesn't matter where we came from...that was hundreds of thousands of years ago..." Then you fucking say "We are fucking different because of Neanderthals..." Those two lines literally contradict themselves. How can us having neanderthals matter if you just said none of that matters since it happened hundreds of years ago? Besides I never brought up Neanderthals to begin with. You did.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Alex xeon Now for the last part, yes ik a lot about \textbf{mental} illness, IQ results and the like. I study psychology. for 5 years now and counting. I've studied neuroscience, Cognitive Science, social psychology, sociology, Human biology, abnormal psychology, forensic studies etc.  Your so obsessed with the biological aspects and only listen to anything else when it supports your view. Read any modern study. Biology only accounts for roughly half of what makes who we are. The other half is the environment, social upbringing etc. Yeah your right about whites scoring higher on tests than middle class blacks. Your forgetting that the MIDDLE class makes a difference. Where do you think the average white person fits into the system? How much do they make a year, on average? Most are UPPER MIDDLE CLASS OR HIGHER! Minorities? what about them? MOST FALL INTO THE FUCKING LOW MIDDLE CLASS OR LOWER! Now your not an idiot. More income means more food, better education, better living conditions, less exposure to bad  and dangerous environments, less exposure to drugs, the list goes on. Less money means the opposite. If it was just biology and \textbf{race} did matter then we would see blacks consistently fail and do horribly no matter where they grew up. But guess what? Studies don't show that! In both adoption studies AND original parent studies, when they compare income, drug rate vilence all that stufff to one child growing up in a poor neighborhood versus one who doesn't, the one who is better off financially always performs better later in life! This is even seen interacially, Put  white boy in the ghetto, guess what he becomes a dtug addict and can't make money. Put him in a nice neighborhood and well to do family? holy fuck the kid is a "genius!" I could go on even more but look up worse than average effect and stereotypes. We react to stereotypes and perform worse or better depending on the stereotype. Once that's removed, we all perform the same. Like your asian example. Asians aren't actually any better than anyone else. The stereotype permeates their performance. If your in a room with an asian, you subconsciously put astress and anxiety on yourself and perfomr worse on the exam, while the asian, knowing the stereotype, will perform better due to not being as nervous. Same thing was found in women. Account for that and make everything the same, guess what? dissapears. Besides people who believe the stereotype spend more time on something they think they should be good at. So....that explains that as well. Finally, here's two links that show actually intelligence and cognitive skill isn't different. You simply misinterpreted the results. Granted one is a bit older but I'm not wasting my time pullling up one of my papers just to dig up a source for you.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Cure4Living Yes but unneeded traits never become very \textbf{common} without the help of natural selection, pale skin was a result of adapting to the enviroment/diet that was different to Africa, few traits that we've evolved are not needed or weren't needed in the past or aren't a side affect of a needed evolution. There are exceptions but again they remain rare, such as ginger hair being only 1-2 of people. Evolution is driven by mutation and natural selection, if a trait is needed those without it die, leaving those with it to live and multiply, if it offers no benefit or negative affect then how it spreads is based more on chance and possibly how attractive people through time find it. Evolution doesn't really happen for humans because our modern knowledge and technology protect the more vulnerable people so most sufficiently well-off populations are unlikely to change even very slightly, barring a random mutation that makes you immune to some horrible disease like cancer or future disease that may cause a lot of damage. Or neutral mutation that manages to get spread around.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Common & \cellcolor{green!27}Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}1/183 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.546 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@luke Hodge Your original statement still indicated that evolution occurs as a response to needs. That is what I was addressing.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Cure4Living I did mention mutations occurring without a need since mutations are random, whether they are passed on is more complicated, if needed for survival than they will likely become \textbf{common} throughout the species, assuming the species scurvies long enough.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@jeppep95  Yes, genetics plays a big role in height but it's not quite 90. According to a fairly recent study it's about 80. That 20 NOT determined by genetics may not sound like much but if you are 2.1336 meters (7 feet), 80 only gets you to 1.70688 meters (5 feet 6 inches).Source: [LINK] Environmental factors in biology are OFTEN understated in discussions/debates on human biology. Everybody believes they did it xyz all by themselves.There are plenty of studies that look at nutrition (or malnutrition) and height. The best place to see this playing out today is to look at the UNICEF study of North Korea vs South Korea."Among other findings, researchers from the World Food Program, UNICEF and the European Union found that, because of long-term food shortages, a staggering 62 percent of children under 7 years \textbf{old} suffer from stunted growth."source: [LINK] But getting back to your original post about bigger and strong, BMI is what I think you are really getting at and that likewise varies. If your question is, could 'breeding' slaves produce a predicted BMI, then the answer is no, not really. You can also see this for yourself.Take a look at all the families with one mom, one dad, and at least 3+ children (or better yet teens and up). If you look at the children, the chances are good their BMI's will vary from child to child, with one being muscular, one being \textbf{chubby}, and one being \textbf{skinny} or any combination of the three. What happened, they all have the same parents? Probability is what happened.For that very reason, a slave owner CANNOT 'breed' their slaves and guarantee a particular BMI.One last thing, human beings are complex and there isn't a 'one answer fits all' when it comes to explaining variations in humans. For example, if you have green eyes, you did \textbf{NOTHING} to acquire those, it was genetics. If you are tall, genetics + environmental factors (having access to diverse foods, clean water, etc etc) are at play. If you are Arnold Schwarzenegger, Manny Pacquiao, or Warren Buffet, you became ripped or very smart by genetics, environmental factors, AND your own hard work to strengthen those muscles whether it's exercising your brain or your arms. The influence of genetics varies depending on the gene or trait being discussed.
