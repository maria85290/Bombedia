  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I honestly think that the media is stirring up racial tension just for the views. I've only ever met one \textbf{black} person that seemed really triggered about \textbf{racism}. The rest have been super laid back.Also my \textbf{black} friends never bring up \textbf{racism} unless I ask them questions, and when I do they sit down and have a mature open minded discussion about it.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small On behalf on a \textbf{coloured} girl myself ( half \textbf{Indian}/half white) this girl is delusional! Saying all white ppl are \textbf{racist} is utter rubbish. How on earth are you solving \textbf{racism} by stereotyping every white person on the planet. Secondly I don't care if you 'meant something different' the actual words you wrote are offensive and you should've owned up to them. Yes I do believe \textbf{racism} against white ppl is real come at me if you want because there is no excuse to say horrible things about white ppl. Lastly, why keep bringing up slavery?? That is in the past. Her comments were based on her experience in the PRESENT which has absolutely \textbf{nothing} to do with slavery because that was ages ago so using the slavery excuse is just weak.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I do think that the \textbf{racist} talk can be a nuisance and you hardly hear any person of 'colour' complaining about this or stressing over it. \textbf{Black} people on the other hand and mixed people that think of themselves as only \textbf{black} and that had an upbringing not surrounded by white or other nonblack cultures tend to have these extreme negative and angry feelings towards white people. However, I will say that I do agree with her on one thing: when the conversation is brought up, yes, white people need to really stop chiming in and finding a way to play the victim, or being offended by the generalization , because that in itself is selfish behaviour. When white people want to find reasons to get offended during this topic, you are basically putting the conversation and the real issue on pause, because you are stuck up on the fact that you got offended over words or an over generalization, and simultaneously forgetting that the real struggle and issue are those experiencing \textbf{racism}. I'm sure \textbf{black} people would rather get offended over minor comments as opposed to experiencing \textbf{racism}.

White people do not have racial struggles and adversities they have to overcome or adjust to unlike minorities especially \textbf{black} people. End of story.

Which, funny enough, I did, and I also did mention it acted as an influence. I even provided two examples to back the latter part up. And in typical SJW way, instead of providing something that would contradict my arguments, you decided to throw a temper tantrum.

So, not only are you \textbf{mental} \textbf{midget} but you make so easy to dance circles around that tiny brain of yours.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Finn Wraith my friend let me tell u SMT. First of all there are scripts from the Greeks for expl. The Greeks were the first euro civilization. The Greeks came to Africa,Kemet,which is now called egypt. Homer and Herodotus wrote bout the ppl they saw and their knowledge and especially their appearance. None of them mentions Arab like or even white ppl! But how come its drawn and shown everywhere as Caucasian? The next thing is; Slavery and Service! Slavery known as what it is not today comes from the white ppl. It is quite unimaginable what this ppl did to human beeings!!! Africans ,Arabs, Hindus,Chinese, Japanese ppl etc. were used to this service labor. Never u had the right to treat ppl like tht. Even when one was captured as war prey it was never ever ever comparable to that satanic bs the White's committed!!! To point to other parts of the world and trynna make others as guilty as whites are only works on stupid idiots! The level of inhumanity and satanism of those ppl,Ur forefathers is just ways beyond imagination so there are two options; 1. Play Ur  story down if thats not possible coz of too much evidence and proof, then do the second thing; Level up the others crimes,so I don't stand alone!!! U say others hot on Africans before? Who? Who? Tell me,I wanna know. As I know the prophet s.a.s said told the prophecy tht the shepherds,the barefooted,shoeless, none having Arabs,will build higher n higher skyscrapers...... Those,who have \textbf{nothing}!!!! Oil was found in the begging of the last century. Islam started 1400 years ago. Before Islam came ,there was \textbf{NOTHING},NOT ONE SINGLE THING FROM THE ARABS!!!!! Swords,body armour,any kind of technologies all came from abroad to them,while in Africa empires like the malinka,Kush, Nubia, punt, Ge'ez,Karthago etc was thriving! And now for all those who think bout Arab like or Berber northafricans......Those ppl aren't the indegenious ppl of northafrica. Those northafricans today came from the Balkan region. Of course there took place mixings so some of them look darker skinned. As we go on. Even the Romans saw,interacted and breed with any type of human beeings!!!! The fact is that modern white ppl started this \textbf{racism} in modern times! Never was there One conquer of for expl. East Africa by Arabs! Also West Africa! The Arab ppl came as refugees to Africa ,to Abessinia! White man stole , HISTORY, identity, conscious, heritage and life's!!!  Now this is even visible  in his history books,he teaches his children,he made LAWS to discriminate human beeings and called them OFFICIALLY 1/3 OF HUMAN!!! NOW U WANNA REALLY TALK ABOUT OTHERS????He made up fake sciences and is still doing tht collective mindrobbery by Media for expl. Brainwash u white . Hollywood embarrassed themselves as \textbf{black} artist denied the Oscars😂Clearly to see the whit agenda thts pierce thru Ur head and u not able to get it😂🤣And that's the case. Whites Never admitted,never excused,never rehabilitated anything! No no no! Instead they tried to fight those surpressed ones by keeping them silent. Why would I try to keep one silent,why would I come up with fake sciences ? Just to preserve the fake I established and to cover up the truth. What is the truth? Well if all what I say makes sense to u, start tracing from the result. The result of white mens actions is that he wanted to make the world believe ,he is the superior one.....By far evrything we know is almost evrything he told is a lie! America was a lie to be the first ones there! So when the result of his campaign ws supposed to be this,what is the reverse?

My original post had me specifically commenting on this \textbf{woman} in this video who clearly gave up on life at one point and then realized that she could get her second wind by blaming others for her shortcomings in life. I'm speaking of this one specific \textbf{woman}. That's clearly what she's doing here and we accept that as truth. Enter you. You came in with your words of wisdom and life knowledge claiming that an entire \textbf{race} is \textbf{racist}. I, as well as you, know that to be false. So I guess my question to is: Did you have a bad day that day Jonathan? Why do you make a false projection onto an entire class? Because, you know, that sounds kinda \textbf{racist} Jonathan. It's almost as if this exchange is somewhat representative of what's going on in today's politics. A bunch of screaming people with no basis for truth,n o backbone to actually do anything about, and proceed to the next step of crowning yourself victim. Because we all know that's how children react. That's the easiest way to cope with your anger. Blame others.

White people often complain about being victim's of \textbf{racism}, complaining that they feel dicriminated and can't prosper because of affirmative action. They say \textbf{Black} people take away their jobs and education,even though blacks still remain the most unemployed,our schools are underfunded, not enough resources,not enough teachers,the Least qualified teachers,just a crappy education. After all your complaints you still get the best education,the most employed,the best housing, controlling all three branches of government. \textbf{Black} people don't control society through laws and resorces,we don't hold positions of power that have been historically destined for white people. Here's a perfect example of white privelidge: A blonde hair blue white man tried to sell me a T.V. He said "I steal  from stores and sell for a higher price". I asked him if he was ever caught and he said "no,the security guards and cops watch your people,they don't expect this from a blonde hair blue eyes white man,I get away everytime". If this is not good enough for you,I don't know what else to tell you. Who gets the best and fastest service in all aspects of life while everyone else is on back of the line? Who worries less about discrimination in all aspects of life? White people are not being pushed to the back of the bus,denied voting rights,denied human rights. You don't walk while white,shop while white,drive while white,live while white. You cruise through life going untouched by all forms of discrimination. Did you hear about the white guy that was realeased from jail after picking up and throwing a kid on your ground for not removing his hat during the national anthem? That's white privelidge, Anyone else would have been giving a high bail,he could've killed that kid. How about Eric Garner,if he was white he would have been sweet talked into submission. " How are you today?" "Are you hungry?" " Want some coffee?" This is another form of white privelidge.White people call the cops and zoom!!! Withing a heartbeat,the cops are on the scene.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small As an Asian, it appears to me that blacks harbor the greatest vocal animosity, and without much merit. However, regarding this issue, I believe it originally lies in the deterioration of our education system. For over a millennia, Trivium and Quadrivium had produced a long line of some of the wisest, virtuous, and intellectually competent men in history. From Emerson, Schiller, Goethe, Kant, Descartes, Spinoza, Swedenborg, Carlyle, Nietzche, Addison, and so forth. This tradition, and the intellectual atmosphere it created was what enabled and propelled mankind out of the medieval ages, into an era of enlightenment and innovation. But in the 1800s, the industrial revolution changed the entire dynamic of progress of Europe and the Americans. Education previously was a long and difficult process, requiring many years of strict cultivation. It is no exaggeration to say that the middle school equivalent back then was what post graduate degrees would be today. Despite this, it was greatly beneficial. However with the industrial revolution looming and booming, many families sought the promise of better pay and employment in the city. They moved in droves, crowding the streets and amplifying the financial and political power of big companies. Most families did not see the pertinence of spending money for an education, when they could simply send their young children to factories, often with dangerous machinery. This became the popular trend. As families became somewhat more financially stable, their numbers grew, increasing the world population. Few generations in, quality education was dying, while general ignorance was extremely \textbf{common}. As it happens, ignorance and cultural shifts go hand in hand. We enter the early 1900s and we see the "party generation" aka the roaring twenties, and subsequently more and more people, raised in the cities, who support materialism and sensuality more then spiritual and intellectual growth. It wasnt until the 1950s that people started dealing with civil rights, women equality, and other social matters. Along with the rise of "hippies". But these people, intellectually speaking, understood little of such affairs, much like today. Ironically, Trivium and Quadrivium was legally pushed out of the curriculum in the 1900s as well. As you may know, education in the modern era is commonly the rote memorization of facts, the crowding of the intellect. An education that does not instill critical thinking, but "what" to think, aka indoctrination. Not to mention "Tests" were often similar to trivia. How does this all tie in to your original post? Well today, such circumstances have set the foundation where there are increasing controversies and issues that revolve around social causes. From \textbf{racism}, to politics, to \textbf{gender} equality, to \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} rights, etc. But majority of people do not have an education that sufficiently enables them to think logically. They move towards emotions, and habits that result from being emotionally biased. As you know, \textbf{racism} is commonly a heavily misappropriated term thats lost all logical significance. Its become a buzzword/scrapegoat to deflect and blame another \textbf{race} or party, putting them under social scrutiny and avoid serious and rational discussion, especially given most of them are incapable of doing so. This is but one example. But above all... "democracy dies in darkness", in other words, the quality of a democratic society is only as a proficient and just as their education enables them to be. As we have seen, it has become deficient in many regards. This ignorance has let SJWs and other less desirable groups spread their ignorance and hatred into what it has become today. All the while continually benefiting off white innovation and progress, though I hate to phrase it like that. In summary, this ignorance is what is enabling anchor babies, illegal immigration, and racial disparity to run so rampant. The election of incompetent people, and the constant pandering and giving in to left leaning groups is the cause of the fall of western culture. Imo, refugees and southern immigrants, \textbf{African} americans, and the Chinese, are currently your worst enemies. China especially has been utilizing every immoral deceit and legal/illegal trickery to suck money off the west. Their whole society was built on theft, copying, and mass underpaid labor. Their society embodies the extreme of everything that is wrong and superficial. The best anyone as an individual can do, is train ones moral and intellectual disposition. Assume the intellectual heritage that forwarded mankind out of darkness. And hopefully, enter a position of power, fighting against the ignorant and unworthy elected.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}African, Common, Gay, Gender, Race, Racism & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General, Sexual Identity - General, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}8/739 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.083 \\  \hline

That free labor laid the foundation of the country when the founding fathers were penning out the pillars of this society. It also lead to the industrial revolution wchich led to even more economic growth while the people who did the work were left with no land, severance pay, could not get loans, jobs, proper education, skill sets, all while fighting for civil rights and in wars to be left out in the cold with little to no assistance from society, or the federal gov while at the same time the federal gov was giving out millions of acres to whites and sending agricultural wards to treach them to farm the land.

If all of humanity accepted Christ and lived according to the law, we would have peace and prosperity on Earth...are there other peaceful religions on Earth, sure, but they don't have the Law nor the Truth, therefore they will be condemned without the law...those who have the law will be judged by the law.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Burning Pipe Maybe we both have problems understanding each other. The only way an atheist  can seem to be more Christian than an actual Christian is by works alone, for he does not believe in the one \& true living God and therefore has no faith or love for him. Even if the atheist' love for other people is true and sincere,  it is meaningless, because faith for our Father comes first; how can you know what love is if you don't know love - that's why Christ will say "get away from me I never knew you". What good is it to be more Christian than an actual Christian if you going to be condemned without the law anyways? You can't earn righteousness or be more righteous, you can't do anything to be saved, you are helpless; all you can do is believe that Christ took away the sins of the world and that He has the power to cleanse you from your sins and have faith that He will keep his promise for He made the promise - "who ever shall believe in me shall have everlasting life". This is what pissed the Pharacees off so much, but it was they who broke the covenant, not God. Phrase 'the law' refers specifically to the compilation of decrees found in the first five books of the Bible, called Torah; it was given by God to his people. We would not even know the difference between good and evil(says Paul), without the law telling us what to do and what not to do. But above all, Paul makes clear that God's love fulfills the law. The law tells us the kind of life that our love for God and our neighbor would require. Obviously all those laws about sacrifices are finished in the one and complete sacrifice of Christ. All the dozens of laws about the land, foods, and rituals of Israel don't pertain to us either. Nor can the keeping of any set of laws give us eternal life.I wrote about the law, because I'm studying the book of Romans at the moment where Paul teaches that we don't just toss out God's commands and become a lawless gang. Every believer is a new person in Christ, therefore he or she loves God and his/her neighbor; the timeless law of God is written in our hearts now and obedience is our joyful adventure. Disobedience to God is our rotten failure. This is why an atheist who acts more Christian than an actual Christian is doomed; it's impossible trying to merit forgiveness, inherit the Kingdom, or evolve spiritually by works. It is only through forgiveness by sheer mercy because of Christ's sacrifice. An actual Christian, can repent for his or hers sins and be filled with the Holy Spirit, because they believe in Christ; which is something an atheist cannot ever do, for an atheist does not know God not believes in His existance. Christ is the new covenant, the new law. We are to be like Christ, even more, we are told to be perfect. Baptism is actually a funeral where we die with Christ and our \textbf{old} bodies get buried with Him and we become new thanks to His resurrection. As God's new creation we actually want to obey His law, not because it gets us anything, but because of our love for Him. "I desire to do your will, O my God; your law is within my heart.'

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small KikiNeko XD Today I'm going to tell you why the argument for that \textbf{black} people cant be \textbf{racist} is a myth. The most \textbf{common} argument is privlage plus power. Or the power structures argument. It is the notion that because that white people have not been oppressed back then society that they can be \textbf{racist} toward them.1: The SJW definitions which stipulate that \textbf{racism} and \textbf{sexism} must be systematic are not found in any dictionary.2: We are going to break down white privilege. White people do not have any edge in America in today's society and government. The reason that people think otherwise is because people want equality of outcome not equality of opportunity. We have equality of opportunity which means that \textbf{black} people can do as much as white people with out discrimination. But what people fail to understand is that if we had equality of outcome that would mean that we would have created a society that does not support work because you no matter how good you would do in the job you would not get more money so in turn you would not be incentivised to work harder. This has already been tried and it faild you might know it as \textbf{communist} Russia.Now for power. \textbf{Black} people can can be elected by the people to the highest office in the land twice in a row. For eight years. Now I dont know what that tells you other than \textbf{black} people can get into any powerful position in the world. But again this comes back to people wanting equality of outcome. The reason that white people hold more powerful positions it because there culture. Now this is vague so I will explain. Asian culture is centered around getting a college degree and getting a high paying job. But on the other side \textbf{black} people do the opposite they shun people who who want to learn. So before you come and attack white people because they hold positions that \textbf{black} people can get why dont you ask why are they not motivated to get to those positions.So now that we have broken down the fundamentals of the argument and disproved them I ask you why do you think that reverse \textbf{racism} is real.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Common, Communist, Racism, Racist, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!5} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}13/379 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.43 \\  \hline

That's why \textbf{black} people still feel oppressed. Not because the government is purposely putting them down like they did in the past, but because \textbf{nothing} is happening to raise them back up. We have to climb out the ghettos ourselves. And some white people wanna say 'just do it and atop being lazy' when they've never experienced that shit. Their privilege is being a descendant from those slave holders, that's already a big privilege. Due to the shit passed down throughout the family. Same goes for why \textbf{black} peoples feel oppressed. White people aren't being punished for their ancestors, they're being punished for not doing shit to fix it.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small As a white guy who lived in Memphis (I stayed at the jobcorp facility 300 students only five of us white) I faced what they call micro aggression and what I call confusion. As I talked to my fellow students ,who have in some cases never even met a white person before(Memphis is heavily segregated), I heard some of the most ludicrous things. I was told "I thought all white people came from money" (my family has been living below the poverty line for generations). When telling some of my friends that I missed my grandmas beans and cornbread or hamhock and collard greens, I was met with looks of shock and the remark that "you eat that? I thought y'all only eat white people food." To which I wondered what the hell white people food was. I took a course at a trade school there and they had a barber class giving free haircuts. Went in to get one and everybody stopped what they were doing and looked at me like I was a leprechaun. The instructor asked me what I wanted which was a simple shortening and she had me sit down. She then pulled out scissors which I said wouldn't Clippers be easier? To which she told me "you can't cut white folk hair With Clippers" which made me laugh cause my mah has only ever used Clippers and same with my dad(marine Nam vet). Before she started cutting she called the class over and had them sit in a full circle around me really close because "they ain't ever cut white folk hair before so you will be an excellent lesson". I sat there as these \textbf{black} students sat there either feverishly writing notes or staring in wonderment in a thinker like pose. On a rare occasion I was able to sneak off campus and go get a beer or something and I was told many times by my \textbf{black} friends "bro you cant go into that hood your a big white guy with glasses and a polo they are gunna think your rich you will be an instant target" I never cared tho cause I'm from west side san antonio and grew up in the hood so I can take care of myself. I did almost get jumped several times but again i know how to handle myself. The point of this story is I never saw it as some form of subverted aggression or ever thought they were \textbf{racist}, I knew that it was simply confusion towards a \textbf{race} they never had the opportunity to socialize with, Thats all it is. Anybody who preaches this microagression garbage is doing \textbf{nothing} more then promoting \textbf{racism} and ignorance and it's going to cause damaging affects.

I'm still considered an evil \textbf{racist} sexist \textbf{homophobic} monstrosity just because a small group of people (and I mean a tiny amount) from these groups are just as closed minded as the KKK. I believe in equality. I believe people should be able to marry and love whoever the fuck they want to b/c it's none of my business who you want to spend the rest of your life with (no children though. I cross the line at children b/c that's messed up). I don't care if you're \textbf{black}, white, asian, hispanic, arabic, or whatever. What does skin color have to do with anything other then being a tool describing how you look? It plays no roll in anything other then appearance. I don't even care about religion, as long as you don't force me to get on my knees and pray I really couldn't care less it is none of my business.

Finally got my shit together work my ass off 2 job's still barely getting from paycheck to paycheck. I just don't understand where I have benefited?. 1 job I worked for 4 years was a factory job.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Animation DramaNation .. canna can't answer your questions, bc he doesn't understand, simply bc he didn't do his homework. You want to argue abt white privilege, when infact, like u had said, \textbf{black} people don't need to score nearly as high on exams/overall grades, in order to get a higher education. Even in the police academy, 70 or higher and you're in. If you're white, 80-85 or higher,\& you're in. They also need to fulfill the quota for having a diverse workplace in all areas of careers/jobs that DON'T EVEN REQUIRE A DEGREE , and \textbf{black} people, again, don't have to score nearly as high as whites who DO have to work harder. Where's the privilege? Also, 'there's more rich white people than rich \textbf{black} people'. Minority means there's a specific group of people that are smaller in population (in america, speaking), so, basic math..more white people means more people that are..'white'. Say you have 100 people living in america,\& 19 of thrm are \textbf{black}, and we'll say (for argument's sake) there's another 18 that are minorities of non-\textbf{african} decent, that leaves 63/100 people are 'white'. Even if 40of minorites of non-\textbf{african} american decent are considered upper class /rich, \& 40 of all \textbf{african} american/\textbf{black} are upper class/rich, that would mean 8.5 ppl 19 \textbf{black} ppl are well-to-do, leaving 'about' 12 people "poor", and 7.8 ppl or rounding off..8 out of 18 minorites of non-\textbf{black} decent, are well-to do, leaving 'abt' 10, "poor", meaning about 22/37 minorites, both \textbf{black} or non-\textbf{black}/\textbf{african} american decent, were considered "poor" (or even middle class..just NOT RICH). AND BC THERE'S 63 WHITE PEOPLE OUT OF 100 PEOPLE, U CAN SIMPLY SAY, "WELL, ONLY 22 MINORITIES OUT OF 100 PEOPLE ARE UPPER-CLASS/RICH" OUT OF 100 PEOPLE...WELL WHY ARE THERE 'NOT ENOUGH' MINORITIES THAT ARE RICH LIKE U 'WHITE FOLKS Look at the numbers. This is an example (if i used a larger-scale sample out of the over 320million ppl living in america, the  of them being \textbf{black}, the  of the other minorites, then the white , of the population, it's always going to seem that 'more WHITE PPL are upper class/rich, simply bc of thr amount of "white people", (which btw, white ppl *do not come from the island/land of 'Caucasia', we have tons of diff origins whether russian, Polish, Ukraine, Australian, Iriah, German, french, austrian, Italy, etc) i can go on\&on. So THAT WITHIN ITSELF IS \textbf{RACIST}.. "White Person". Just use numbers and also look at allll the numerous foundations for \textbf{African} Americans, not just for furthering education, but the NAACP, \textbf{black} networks (Bounce, BET, etc)..there is SO MANY RESOURCES for \textbf{black} people.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small It is high time we stopped being so polite, and set the record straight. Munroe Bergdorf is utterly ignorant of 1400 years of human history. Islamic imperialism inflicted centuries of genocide, tyranny, plunder, cruelty and slavery across the globe. After Eastern and Southern Europe had suffered centuries of being raided by brutal Islamic slave traders, so much so that the word slave [Slav] derives from this history, Poland led a coalition that successfully defended Europe against the Muslim invasion at the Gates of Vienna on 9/11 in 1683. The Ottoman slave trading Islamic empire committed some of the worst genocides in history [against whites] and was finally defeated at the turn of the 20th century. For over a millennium Arabs and Turks enslaved white Europeans. Indeed you could make a strongly evidence based case that the Dark Ages in Europe were a result of incessant slave raids, plundering and attacks that disrupted Europe's access to world trade routes. Saudi Arabia finally banned slavery under UK pressure in 1962, though it is still practiced across North Africa.Munroe should acknowledge that the Crusades were pushing back against war Jihad and slave raids that were occurring on an intense and continuing basis from the seventh century until the invaders were finally defeated in the war against the Ottoman Empire at the beginning of the 20th century. We were lead to believe that the Crusades were just some kind of religious  zealotry, a kind of armed Evangelism on horseback. Whereas in actuality the Crusades defended Europe against constant slave raids, plunder and invasion.She should also realise that underdevelopment in India and Africa was probably caused by centuries of Islamic imperialism that left mountains of skulls, plundered the wealth of nations, destroyed peaceful cultures, dismantled civilisations and enslaved generations. It was so brutal that 90 of \textbf{Black} slaves bled to death from castration. This commenced long before white folks set forth on these continents. Still want to say we are the evil ones? No, we are too diplomatic to defend ourselves, but this has to stop. We have to start telling the truth, no matter what bullies try to impose silence upon us.The fact is everyone has suffered more from Islam than from any other invader on this earth. White Europeans have suffered far more from Islamic imperialism, than anyone has suffered from white Europeans.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!5}1/393 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.254 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small And that is how a majority of white people feel. This is why colonization happened in the first place.

They constantly portray other races that are not white negatively in all of their media from Blacks to Chinese, Mexicans and Middle Eastern and this is because of the inherent \textbf{racism} a lot of white have still believing the \textbf{race} is the best. Even no as the US continues to demonize China for it's solidifying relations with Africa it's well known that the US and Europe never included Africa into the original trade equally as Europe and America was being built up so they portray Africa as savages leaving out this historical fact and kept Africa poor barely investing money to cause real economic change in Africa but now that China has seriously invested in Africa and Africa is relying less and less in the US the US is actually starting to trade more farely with Africa because the US and Europe aren't the only major players anymore. When you correlate why whites in America kept slaves from trying to read and write to why Europe and the US kept Africa poor you will realize their is a lot of \textbf{Racism} from whites still to this day that do not value non-whites and still want to benefit from their countries on top.

This in turn inspired people like William Wilberforce in the UK who pushed for the Slavery Abolition Act passed in 1833. The United States had a war which white people died in to abolish slavery. It also happened to be Western countries which were the first to fight for and win women's suffrage, \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} rights and civil rights.

Living in a colorblind bubble is a white privilege.  The idea that the full promise of America is accessible to all is not a reality for the overwhelming majority of Americans and almost all \textbf{black} people.  It may be true that you don't sit around thinking about \textbf{race} or how to hurt \textbf{black} and brown people, and you may believe this makes you accepting.  It is a historical fact that this society was built on \textbf{racism}.  Until the 1960's everyone who was not white was legally segregated from interacting with and marrying them.  Until the 1960's, a \textbf{black} man could be hung for even touching a white \textbf{woman}.   I'm convinced that in one of the most \textbf{racist}, xenophobic political climates in a long time your belief "any American can do anything" is a product of the white bubble the extermination of Native Americans and free labor of \textbf{black} and brown people has built and allowed you to have.America is more segregated now than any time during legal segregation (these are irrefutable facts, look at the Census data for yourself).  You and your white family, even if urban, more than likely live in a neighborhood full of other white people.  Because of this, schools are even more segregated then they were before Brown vs Board of Education!  Your families were allowed to amass wealth that was built on the backs of slave labor while \textbf{black} people were legally denied franchise, voting rights, the right to own property, and to marry a white person well into the 1960s.  So yes, our poverty now is directly tied to 300 years of forced labor, and THEN \textbf{Jim C\textbf{row}} segregation, separate but equal schools, gerrymandering, redlining, blockbusting, mass incarceration, and a whole host of things whiteness has allowed you to only hear about on the news.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Crow, Jim Crow, Race, Racism, Racist, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}11/324 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.395 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small ​\@Keep Holden On On the contrary, I believe that's exactly what this has become: an oppression competition. The list is almost infinite as to the level of privilege, or oppression, that any one human being can be born with or into. Categories and labels, and certainly racial categories, are superficial and meaningless at best; at worst, they are simply tools used for divide and conquer tactics. In Thomas Shapiro's book: The Hidden Cost of Being \textbf{African} American, he argues that wealth perpetuates inequality...no kidding! You don't EVER need to think about skin color to figure that one out. So then the argument consists of: what, if any, reparations should be made, to whom, why and how? And that's not even touching the surface as to what 'equality' really means, whether it's realistic or even desirable...\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!5}1/135 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.741 \\  \hline

We don't like to admit it, but imbedded deep into our cognition is a judgement program running on auto-pilot and our senses serve this evolutionary purpose. And yes, those senses include visual. So within seconds of meeting someone every single one of us is making judgements: \textbf{sex}, height, weight, facial expression, posture, clothes, social hierarchy AND skin color.Any/all forms of systematic oppression should be avoided and combated, but we won't further the conversation by entering an oppression competition.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small You all have it wrong. In Ireland during the time of British occupation, Irish charged with minor crimes, were usually signed into indentured servitude as punishment, this was not slavery as we know it today but their servitude was sold to pay the cost of their crimes. Usually the main buyers of Irish indentured servants were large land owners in British colonies mainly in North America, the Caribbean Islands and Australia. The main buyers were almost always of British protestants origin who for many years were propagated into believing the Irish were of an inferior \textbf{race} not only because they were Catholic but because the believed the Irish to be unnatural, inbread, corrupt and uncivilised and treated them as they would any \textbf{black} or indigenus slaves. The only reason the Irish could not be legal slaves is because they were Catholic and therefore Christian and by Christian law put in place around the 11th or 12th century Christians could not own fellow Christians as slaves or else they would face excommunication from the church. An extra fact is that a lot of the minor crimes committed by the Irish were simple crimes such as stealing their own crops to feed their families as in those days the majority of Ireland was owned by the British crown and the Irish were only allowed tenancy and anything grown or produced on these lands belonged to the crown not the people who cultivated them.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/241 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.83 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Random Guy ok. I was waiting for this.\textbf{African}'s actively fought against the slave trade.What you are speaking on is chattel slavery.\textbf{African} Slavery by Europeans was it's very own evil. That benefitted the entire world, despite active resistance by \textbf{African} nation's and their Kings and Queens(1470 - 1800). This fight was foughy in their homeland, on the seas, and in America. There was continuous resistance against Europeans during every phase of the slave trade. Because the rebellions of the \textbf{African} slaves increased, the slave traders created laws designed to reduce \textbf{African} resistance. The information we have on on the resistance to slavery came from written documents kept by the European sailors. There is enough information, including historical facts, examples of resistance, and dislike of the European slave trade, to establish that the enslavement of Africans was not accepted by \textbf{African} people. \textbf{African} leaders and those opposing the European slave trade, organized and assigned large groups to keep watch for slave ships traveling to the East and whose crews were well-known for kidnapping Africans on the coast. For example, King Ansah of Ghana (1470-1486) had the Fante people watch for European ships, and prevented them from coming ashore. Many other \textbf{African} leaders did not permit Europeans in their kingdoms. In Benin, the people had heard of the intentions of the Europeans, so they killed them as soon as they came ashore. There were some kings who agreed to trade with the Europeans, but attempted to stop it once they saw the problems that were created in their lands. Through the tactics of several \textbf{African} leaders and kings, they were able to minimize the European slave trade but they could not stop it completely. The treachery and greed of the Europeans, hurt the \textbf{African} economy and, therefore, damaged trade relations. \textbf{African} King Nzenga Maremba tried to stop the slave trade in the Congo only after he originally participated in the trade in exchange for military items and support from Portugal. King Maremba agreed to release his \textbf{African} prisoners of war to the Portuguese who wanted the best (1470 - 1800) young \textbf{African} men as a bargaining chip to be sure the King kept his word. The Portuguese promised to train and educate the young men to become priests and later to return them to the Congo. King Meremba let the Portuguese convince him to take the Christian name, Alfonso, as a show of support. When Alfonso asked for the return of a few of his former prisoners, who had been trained to serve as physicians, surgeons, pharmacists, assistants for shipbuilders and carpenters, his requests were denied. After having his requests denied several times, King Alfonso learned that his prisoners of war had been sold as slaves in Portugal. In 1526, King Alfonso wrote to King John III, the former King of Portugal, and asked for his help in ending the slave trade in the Congo. He explained the freedoms that were given to the Portuguese, who had set up shops, become merchants in the Congo and had amassed fortunes. The people in the Congo could not do the same because they had complied with the agreement and now did not have the same abundance of wealth as the invaders. King Alfonso related that the damage was so great that his people and land were being seized daily. King Alfonso ended his letter to King John III with another request for his help because it was the will of the people in the Congo and other kingdoms that there should not be any trading of slaves nor markets for slaves. Other countries that were resisting the slave trade throughout the continent of Africa were Senegal, Ghana, Benin, Ni geria, and Angola. In 1777, King Agadja, a Dahomean monarch, captured an Englishman and his slave raiding party who had entered his kingdom looking for more Africans. The Englishman and his crew were released after they promised to return all the Africans they had captured. King Agadja gave the Englishmen a warning to take to the rulers of England, that if any other slave traders were sent to his Kingdom, or other kingdoms, they would be killed. In 1787, the Senegal King of Almammy, passed a law that made it illegal to take enslaved Africans through his kingdom. To let (1470 – 1800) Europeans know how serious the law was, the king returned the presents French slave traders sent as bribes. Queen Nzingha of Angola fought a successful 30-year war against the slave traders of Portugal until the Portuguese negotiated a treaty with her in 1656. Their treaty remained in effect until she died in 1663.P.S.But your history books don't have that😏. Why?

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Vito Scaletta I never said Eastern Europe had slaves.  In fact during the 1930s  blacks were migrating to Russia  to escape American persecution controlled mostly by  Irish Protestants.  The enemy to \textbf{black} Americans has always been the Irish extremist*  The Irish extremists accepted anyone light-skinned to reap the benefits of White status.  That included*  the Italians, Polish, Germans. Look up Senaca village later turned into Central Park.  \textbf{Black} people allowed Irish catholic  immigrants to seek refuge on their land and then the Irish tore it down by laws that benefitted them.  Look at gangs of New York.  I find it hypocritical that irish and Sicilian immigrants tell blacks to get off the Democratic plantation when they used the same  democratic plantation ticket to gain power and acceptance in the United States through Tammany Hall.  It was the Irish extremist  that started the white  status in America due to poverty and genocide that they experienced in Ireland.  The other European immigrants such as German and Sicilians just followed them.  Germany hates the United States. Russia, and most Eastern Europeans countries do not like the United States.  That has to do with the inflated sense of superiority that white Americans have over other countries.  This is taught in American schools.  It's called American exceptionalism.

We \textbf{black} people will be happy to provide the medical assistance that is needed for you to stay alive but \textbf{black} people should not involve themselves in the struggles of politics.

Eat healthy, exercise, read books from the past, stay away from television. Meditate at least 1 hour per day.

I mean how often do you hear something \textbf{racist} about someone and you stick up for them? Not taking a stance against something just because it's "out of your hands" doesn't make it right or you right. The problem is that there is so much disparity in the first place.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Give'ryourall Lol well again the people that are in your circumstances I understand not taxing, but however my initial comment was talking about spreading the excess wealth from millionaires and billionaires. Again everyone acknowledges the wrongs of the past, but basically all society wants to do is say "sorry oh well deal with it" no one actually wants to be willing to make it slightly unfair now to help balance how unbalanced it is now. And again I say \textbf{black} but I really mean just non white people.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Gabriel Bennett But the topic is 'do all white people benefit from \textbf{racism}' and the answer to that is no, only a small fraction of white people benefit from \textbf{racism}. I don't agree with distributing the wealth of millionaires at all. Is it fair for a person with 1 million to share their wealth? Absolutely not. Should the multi billionaire CEO's share their wealth? Yes, but that's a different matter, as big business is mostly exploitive and is rarely clean, but distribution of wealth is not a solution to tackling \textbf{racism} exclusively, as poor white people are also exploited and left behind by the same system and that also does not solve the issue of \textbf{racist} incarceration and lack of equal opportunity in education and employment.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Give'ryourall Because to me you can either be for or against. Content really isn't a bad thing it just means your willing to except the way things are and it doesnt really bother you if things change, while most white people think all \textbf{black} people do is complain all day long but the difference is because we actually want change. The ones who stay "silent" about it are slightly contributing. Lol it's like nowadays the "innocent bystander" means standing by watching and laughing but not being directly involved. It truly is a sad time, however I do see your point about poor white kids in the system. The thing I hate about that point though is that its counterproductive. Like with \textbf{black} lives matters, I'm not an advocate but people dont realize that by creating an "All Lives Matter" it distracts from the real issue! Yes some white families have it hard, BUT no matter how hard you have it the reality is if you have a poor \textbf{black} family in london or anywhere  vs a poor white family, the way the SYSTEM is set up, it would be easier for the white kid to be more successful. And again this isn't generalization I know that every human makes their own choices and some people work harder than others but there are just a lot more roadblocks for people of color especially if they're of low income\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!27}3/237 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.266 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Give'ryourall Well again with not a whole lot of funds only your voice can be heard ya know. I mean as long as we as people are continuing the narrative that it's ok the way things are then things will never change but your direct action isn't any different from mine or anyone else's. I too dont have many funds the biggest difference is though when white people admit to injustices, its heard more clearly rather than \textbf{black} people just sounding desperate and lazy. So in reality your word holds more weight than mine because remember its easier to separate than it is to unify.And again I'm no advocate. I'm a \textbf{black} man in America that has more than accepted society because that's truly the only way to get ahead is to suck it up and control what you can control.

Most right handed people have not consciously set out to create a world that favours righties, however, this does not change the fact that right handed people have an advantage in the environment they live in (a small percentage of left handed people die because of accidents related to their handedness). It's not a completely flawless analogy, but I find it is a useful way to take the emotion out of the argument to understand the nature of the problem.

If a \textbf{black} man goes for a job that a white man goes for (both having the same educational back ground) who will get the job?

(which i am agreeing with by the way.) it doesn't mean that it doesn't affect white people. it affects all us, negatively.. EVEN for the people who get some sort of advantage out of it (e.g. they get a job over a \textbf{black} guy because they are white) this is still a negative affect. it lowers our worth as a species just because it exists. not to mention it causes separation and bloodshed, so lets all just agree that \textbf{racism} is a outdated, and stupid way of thinking, move forward with the SHARED goal to get rid of it... to put it in a argument that counters your statement... if you get the 'oppressors' to agree its a bad thing, then maybe this will help us all agree to move forward with a more enlightened open mindset.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Walter Khayyam but it's not true communism, the very essence of communism is that everyone is worth just the same as everyone else, the attempts at communism in the last century or so have all led to dictatorships, because the wrong people were put in charge. A good, true \textbf{communist} society is totally democratic, the government cannot do anything without the say so of the people. There are two forms of \textbf{communist} government, one where a leader is chosen by a majority, but must always do as the people say, and one where there is no leader, but any law changes, new legislations are given to the public and decided by a vote. Had properly democratic systems been installed and maintained in Russia, Cuba, China or North Korea, true communism could've been achieved and they would have acted as beacons to the rest of the world, shining examples of countries full of happy people. Unfortunately, Russia had its Stalin, the DPRK has the Kims, China had its chairman Mao, and Cuba had its Castro. These people didn't share all of their power with the population of their respective countries, and in doing so made themselves more important, more powerful, than their fellows. If you look back to the ideal model of communism as I outlined earlier, you will see that all these people went against that ideal, and therefore are not true communists.Ps I know that Lenin was the first Russian \textbf{communist} leader, I just don't like to condemn him so much, as he was the leader of a Russia at war, so we don't really know what kind of leader he would've been in peacetime.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Walter Khayyam sorry, but as you say, everyone has different abilities. An illiterate and innumerate person could have many skills which many literate and numerate people do not have. They could be much fitter, they could be much more perceptive, they could have better people skills. People seem to forget that a \textbf{communist} society still needs people with people skills, such as psychologists, psychiatrists, counsellors, civil servants, etc. These are all jobs that an innumerate or illiterate person could do. These people aren't worthless, they're just as valuable as you or I, by your logic Stephen hawking's value and benefit to society are measured by his illness, when anyone who knows the first thing about him will tell you that's not so. People with physical disabilities can have far better \textbf{mental} skills than some people without, and those who are illiterate or innumerate have similar qualities. One argument, similar to yours, which says illiterate people should be disqualified from jobs because, apparently, they are unable to take notes, as all of the jobs I have listed above will count note-taking as a part of that. The primary school I went to, while mainly teaching children without special education needs, had a renowned and accomplished Supported Learning department, and one of the things they helped illiterate children, or those with dyslexia, do was to write notes in a form of shorthand similar to a picture, for short term use, and at the next opportunity, the children would record their notes on a dictaphone, and they were taught how to manage the MP3 files on a computer and so became good audio learners. This wouldn't be difficult for the jobs I've listed above. I had a music teacher who was dyslexic, and it had next to no impact on our lessons, all it meant was that the odd word may be slight misspelled when amending music. Just because someone is at a physical or neurological disadvantage to those around them, it doesn't mean they can't fulfil themselves and play a valuable role in society.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Communist, Mental & \cellcolor{green!5} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}2/342 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.585 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Rape God you keep contradicting yourself, in the same comment you're saying that some people are worth more than others, you're actually trying to say that \textbf{disabled} people or those with \textbf{mental} health/neurological conditions are worth less than so called "normal" people, but then you're saying that everyone is a mixture of strengths and weaknesses. Also, communism doesn't deny anyone their human rights, indeed, quite the opposite. Communism basically means that everyone works to benefit the society, and everyone benefits, in turn, from the society. People can still enjoy art, literature, religion, music, etc. but just as long as no one person or group of people is given less or greater access to these things than anyone else. It's not about everyone living in poverty, it's about everyone living with the same level of wealth. Many people think that works such as Orwell's 1984 represent proper communism, but they don't. They only represent what happens when communism fails. Not trying to disrespect Orwell, and I have great respect for his books (and I enjoy reading them immensely!) but anyway, back to point. Everyone, no matter what their physical, \textbf{mental} or neurological state, can be of value to society. It's almost like an ecosystem: everyone has their little niche, somewhere, where they can work to the benefit of their own life, and the lives of those around them.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Walter Khayyam no, what I'm saying is that a \textbf{communist} society, like any society, has jobs that are more and less important than others. For instance, a society would collapse without sustainable food and water sources, but it wouldn't collapse because there were no libraries. There are some things which society is dependant on, and some things it could function without. In the eyes of a \textbf{communist} society, as long as every job in every sector is being filled to an appropriate quota, and as long as people are all putting in the real effort, everyone is making an equal contribution to the society, regardless of \textbf{race} or ability/disability, whatever. A person in a wheelchair could work perfectly well work in, say, a water purification plant or anywhere else where walking/running was not a key aspect of the job. Basically, with regard to communism, everyone has somewhere in society where they can work hard and make themselves useful, a niche, if you will. As long as everyone is operating within their appropriate niche and applying themselves properly, they contribute equally to the society, the society is protected, as are those within it, and provided everyone is working hard and working fruitfully, in the eyes of a \textbf{communist} society, everyone is equal.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Communist, Race & \cellcolor{green!5} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}4/211 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.896 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Scottish also, with regard to the Africa debate, \textbf{nothing} that you have said is incorrect. However, none of it disproves what I was saying, either. And some of what you said was incorrect. The Egyptians, for instance, had hieroglyphs, and what are they if not a form of writing? It was \textbf{African} societies who are thought to have invented the concept of trade and money. M not denying that, after leaving Africa, those who had left came on leaps and bounds, much faster than those still in Africa, but, again, those who had left were in more favourable environments. Also, you speak as though tribal societies were limited solely to Africa, but they weren't. I'm from Scotland, and up until the 19th century, we had a clan system in effect, particularly up in the highlands, and that is a form of tribalism, but those clans still intermingled, intermarried and traded with each other. The \textbf{African} tribes were very much the same, it's only that as time went on, they began to grow hostile to one another, which was the situation the Europeans found them in in the 16th century. In fact, the local authorities actually traded with the Europeans when they went to Africa! In exchange for guns, metal products, etc, local chiefs and kings would give prisoners of war as slaves, or they would pay in spices or other goods. If you want to talk about Africa today, that's a very dangerous argument, because it's largely the fault of those Europeans, who, in the 16th century, stunted Africa's development, perhaps permanently, by removing their most able and their fittest, not to mention a large proportion of their fertile adults.

Scotland was far more advanced, Aberdour Castle was built around the year 1200, Scottish Gaelic had been in written form since at least the 6th century, etc tribalism and advancement are not mutually exclusive.Only one country in the region had a written language, Ethiopia who wrote in Amharic.Now you're saying Europeans are largely to blame, another myth.

Why is it India who was conquered numerous times throughout history can move forward and advance whilst South Africa crumbles? Mmmmmm gee what could it be what could it be.....In 2002, Wealth and the IQ of Nations posited frightfully low IQ numbers for Sub-Saharan Africa.  When the book's authors - Richard Lynn and Tatu Vanhanen - recalculated the data in their 2006 update, IQ and Global Inequality, they arrived at equally abysmal figures: Sierra Leone (64), The Congo (65), Zimbabwe (66), \textbf{Guinea} (66), Nigeria (69), The Gambia (66), Senegal (66), Mozambique (64), Gabon (64), Central \textbf{African} Republic (64), Equatorial \textbf{Guinea} (59), Liberia (67), Lesotho (67), Angola (68), Niger (67), South Africa (72).For reference I believe the level for retardation is between 55-65.I put it to you that if you removed all western influence good or bad they'd be worse off, no infrastructure, no systems of governance, \textbf{nothing}, so where you look to the bad I see the potential good. Even today these countries and their corrupt leaders have done \textbf{nothing} to further the cause of their people. Constant civil wars, disease, overpopulating and a reluctance to catch up to the rest of the world has done more damage than 10,000 years of European colonial rule would.India had it as bad as Sub-Saharan Africans but today they have excelled compared to Africa, why? Because when colonialism ended India kept the good things like the court system, they copied our laws, even today \textbf{Indian} lawyers wear the barrister headgear. They took the infrastructure blueprint whereas Africa destroyed the infrastructure left behind by colonial nations as seen in South Africa today. India took advantage of what a relevantly superior system had to offer and built on it, Africa destroyed it, that's what 10-20 points of an IQ difference between nations achieved, no excuses.This argument for me is like the 50 year \textbf{old} living is his mother basement still blaming his parents for his failures in life.

They also need not share any physical traits, skin colours, or any biological factor besides being human. By the logic of the rather laughable justice officials, Christians must surely also be a \textbf{race}, as well as Muslims and Sikhs, not to mention Buddhists and Hindis. But, you see, it doesn't work like that. Why? Because the law wasn't passed because of Judaism, is was passed to combat anti-semitism.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Common, Ethnic, Race, Racism & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}11/363 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.03 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Matthew North first off, that's a bit rich, coming from you. Secondly, US laws are totally irrelevant in this case, and you don't seem to be realising the motive behind the law being passed. What is important in any law is the reason it was passed, the problem it's trying to fix, and whether or not it fixes that problem. As shown by your good self, the law has not stopped anti-Semitism, which it was designed to do. Jews are legally considered a \textbf{race} in one country because, despite having so many amendments to their constitution, the Americans decided to go down this absurd route rather than passing another law which said that sectarianism will be treated the same way in a court of law as anti-Semitism. They could've thrown in \textbf{homophobia}, transphobia, all the other kinds of discrimination in there while they were at it, but for some reason decided that they aren't proper forms of discrimination. And, with regard to the Jewish people, the US justice system mutilated the meaning of a biological term in the law, by making Jewish people a \textbf{race} of their own, despite the aforementioned lack of \textbf{common} ancestry or bodily features.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Common, Homophobia, Race & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General, Sexual Identity - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}4/198 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.02 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Matthew North first, off the only way I'm wrong is by a legal technicality, I've already told you the only reason Judaism was ever called a \textbf{race}, and it's by a justice system with no impact here whatsoever, the US justice system is \textbf{nothing}, it's just a drop in the ocean, it's another country's policy, there's no reason to apply it here. Second, there's \textbf{nothing} satanic about Jewish mysticism, it's just classed as a group of people aiming to reveal a different meaning to the Torah. There's only one site that says Kabbalah is satanic, and the guy who wrote it, David J Stewart, seems, from what he's written, to be crazier than any of the satanic business he's accusing people of. He's some crackpot conspiracy theorist, who just goes on to blabber on about the new world order, et cetera, et cetera. Again, of those six people, only three are even from Jewish families!

They will never let it go and will keep blaming us for their fucked up communities which they could easily fix themselves, but instead blame the rest of us for holding them back, when in reality they've had shit loads of chances to fix it. In other interviews when she's asked a tough question, she just does that stupid smirk and acts like we're all stupid who didn't understand her because of "context".  Many \textbf{black} communities not only in the UK, but the US, live within this gang culture lifestyle. If a \textbf{black} guy who's well dressed, looks presentable walks on to a bus, \textbf{nobody} would care, and would sit next to him happily, I certainly would. But even if it was a white, or \textbf{black} person with a hoodie who looked like they just walked off the council estate, then yes, some people might be a bit worried if it's late at night. That isn't racial profiling, it's culture profiling, by looking at how they dress. \textbf{Nobody} likes to judge others. But at a human instinct level, we assess possible risks and act on those risks by deciding to get up, or to get another bus. I grew up on a council estate, and in some places the kids are \textbf{crazy}, and people are right to have reservations. There is a lot more to societys problems than just \textbf{black} victimhood.

No, but these things are happening largely as a reaction to previous events. America is a horribly fucked up mess in general and one of the reasons there's racial tension is that like South Africa it has made every effort to segregate whites from blacks despite forcing them to share the same country.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Johnny Caruthers I'll be surprised if you read all of this, so I just want to get a few quick points out of the way at the very start.First, there is a "White Lives Matter" you donkey. It's called the alt-right, the movement was started by self proclaimed white supremacist Richard Spencer and the movement is currently in league with nazis and white nationalists (who will try to deny this despite sharing pretty much all the values of the other 2 groups). I have a strong feeling that you're familiar with them or at least their rhetoric, since in another comment I've just read you claim that "the left" (as if it's a monolith) has "demeaned" (not the word I'd pick, but okay) the meaning of the word "\textbf{racism}". This is "alt-right" speak if I ever heard it.You brought up white farmers in South Africa being killed and I gave you a bit of perspective. I know it's irritating when pertinent facts get in the way of feelings, but there they are.I also have a very simple question before I get to the bulk of my comment: should a policeman or \textbf{woman} be held to a higher standard than some \textbf{dumb}, \textbf{black} criminal?Affirmative Action in America should be changed, but so should the entire college admissions system. If anything, there should be a form of Affirmative Action aimed directly at smart kids who may not have the resources at home to get the kind of education that will allow them to excel in life. Rich people should not be able to buy their way into the best colleges.Your assertion that whites are losing out on jobs because of affirmative action rings false. A \textbf{black} person hired for a job must still meet the criteria for the position. To say otherwise is to say that businesses don't care who they hire if they can't hire a white person and that they're willing to break the law just to hire \textbf{ethnic} minorities and women, which is a profoundly stupid thing to believe. Also, someone is going to be hired, which means there will be people, white and otherwise, who were perfectly qualified who didn't get the job. That's how the job market works. I'm guessing you're still quite young if you're not aware of this?After all that, I must say that since we don't have such a thing as "Affirmative Action" in the UK, I'm not personally invested in the issue.You seem to want me to be a spokeman for BLM, but in my final paragraph I made it clear that I don't condone their actions."Do I condone any of this? No" - Me, in my original comment. AS I'VE ALSO ALREADY SAID, they absolutely do not belong in the UK. The UK and USA are completely different cultures, in that one of us has a rich and diverse one and the other is basically a money-centric, \textbf{race} obsessed toxic mess with a gun fetish.I think that BLM are unhelpful in their current form and the fact that people have committed crimes in their name in a manner that is unquestionably related to their core issue (i.e. they are against police violence against blacks and blacks have killed police in the name of BLM) makes them untenable whether they endorse the actions or not. Having said all that, I doubt we could have any kind of meaningful conversation about them because I'm willing to bet that you've never read their own mission statement, instead choosing to believe whatever their critics have to say (i.e. they're \textbf{racist}, terrorists, they call for the death of police (who come in all racial flavours but let's conveniently leave that fact out), they don't care about \textbf{black} on \textbf{black} crime, etc.)?\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Dumb, Ethnic, Race, Racism, Racist, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}10/633 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.58 \\  \hline

The US killed 225,000 of its own men trying to keep people in bondage and chattel slavery.  The Civil War ended to stop the country from killing even more of its own citizens.  A hundred years after the Civil War, all people of color were simply "\textbf{colored}" and had to live under legal segregation and \textbf{Jim C\textbf{row}} laws.  It wasn't until the early 1970s that most legal discriminatory laws were abolished them.  None of this is the fault of any \textbf{African} or Muslim.  The fact that a lot of people have slaves does \textbf{nothing} to explain away why the US had federal laws based on \textbf{race} for 300 years.  Lets fixate not deflect.  Slavery is wrong every single time.  The most conservative estimates of slave labor amount to 8 trillion dollars of free labor, all of it earned on US soil.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small mkzhero It doesn't matter how many people owned slaves.  It's not much different than how the top 10 owns 90 of the wealth in this country today.  This is a capitalist society.  The means of production and the wealth is designed to be in the hands of the few, not the many.  During American slavery, the slaves themselves were the wealth.  They were the assets and virtually all big banks, big universities, big agra, and big business was built from that industry.  Adjusted for inflation, one slave was worth about 250k in profit and the profit of the future slave was equity that loans were taken out against.  Derivatives on those loans were sold which propped up many of the companies and industries we still rely on today.  I focus on US slavery because I am an American descendant of those slaves.  I can't speak for any other country or any other tribe of people.  Muslims and Africans can tell their slaves to do whatever they wish.  40 acres and a mule was promised to emanicpated slaves by the federal government in this \textbf{nation} and they did not follow through on their promise.  You can focus on the obvious result of capitalism which is that the wealth, which were slaves, were held in the hands of the few or the fact that EVERY Native born \textbf{African} American is a descendant of slaves.  Before 1980 there was virtually no immigration allowed by \textbf{black} people from any country on the planet.  So anyone \textbf{black} in America with a native born grandparent is a descendant of chattel slavery and bondage.  That means that grandparent went to legally segregated schools, lived in legally segregated neighborhoods, and were legally locked out of employment and financial products solely because of their \textbf{race} through the 1970s. I have four of those grandparents and two parents that went through the same.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}African, Black, Nation, Race & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}5/313 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.597 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Well, interesting, I for example am quarter Jew, and i don't harbor any resentment to Germans for what their parents did, i don't think they should pay me anything or live in constant apology for what happened (they should remember it and acknowledge it was wrong though), all the people involved are long gone anyway and i'm not gonna blame kids that had \textbf{nothing} to do with what happened. And that's despite it being worse in my case - there was not only segregation, racial discrimination, taking over property, slave labor, but also an eventual all out genocide. Also, seems you don't get how progress and finance works. Slavery is a non profitable business on a country-sized scale, it is only good for manual labor, and it actually KEEPS PROGRESS AND AUTOMATION AWAY, so if you think such a huge country owes all of its success and riches to a handful of physical laborers... Well, might want to go check your IQ. And "doesn't matter how many owned slaves"? REALLY? Not only that most where not involved in this, and that those who did own slaves are long gone, but you acknowledged yourself that the oppression was from the government and the powerful, and people can't exactly influence it at all.. Unless they go to war. And that's EXACTLY what they did. Actually there might have been a bigger percentage of AFRICANS involved in the slave trade than there was slave owners in America. Did the Africans go to war against them? Did any of those responsible for it in the past and their children feel guilty? Would you, and a lot of others would even be here talking if not for the American anti-slavery laws and worldwide involvement? Slavery existed since the dawn on mankind, and it was practiced until very recently, as you know (If you exclude Africa and the middle east where its still a thing)... For all i know, without America's anti slave involvement, this shitty practice could have still been legal worldwide, and yet here we are, having people from all over shaming the first, and only country in the world who fought to free its slaves,  and outlaw slavery all over the world. You're going about this in modern logic, but back then, people lived less, where far less educated and open to ideas, there was no internet, barely any public libraries, no automation, bad healthcare and a shitload of other problems to take care of.. And so they did just that - took care of all the biggest problems first. Do you think in such hard times, with such bad conditions people are like now, ready to learn and accept new ideas and change prejudice? Well, they're not. Only when the things finally stabilized after the industrial revolution and all the world wars that they got to the question of racial segregation.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}1/479 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.209 \\  \hline

And while the holocaust is definitely to be remembered, but i, and a lot of other partial, and even full blood Jews think there's no use from dwelling on it as much as a lot of people do, as it brings \textbf{nothing} but sadness, self victimization and no merit whatsoever, if not even the opposite. That's exactly my point, and its easily proven by that blacks where doing much better before this welfare, racebating, and self-victimization started a couple of decades ago. It actually broke the \textbf{black} family that was doing really well before, and wouldn't even break back under segregation and even slavery. Yet look at it now - \textbf{black} success plummeted, and fatherlessness in the \textbf{black} community is an outright meme at this point.

He chooses to ignore the reality that many others have to face and that works on a personal level, but it doesn't work for a society. Luckily we have more people in the world that don't share his thoughts who find ways to fight and talk for those who don't have a voice.Your answer for solving the problems in society is to run and move to somewhere else, what happens to those that come behind you. Should they then have to do the same thing? You lose or stop being aliened with \textbf{racism} and all those other hate groups when you do the moral thing and stand up for those who don't have the ability to speak and be heard.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small This 'white privilege' nonsense is a product of critical theory. Critical theory is a Marxist tool and it is now the mainstay of non-STEM academia. It was invented by the Frankfurt School and involved criticizing everyone and everything ad nauseum. Marxists found that Socialism in itself was unpopular and hard to implement, so rather than create, they aimed to destroy the fabric of traditional society and replace it with their phony, destructive ideology. Their goal was to use endless criticism to deconstruct traditional values and morality, and shift away from objective truth. Frankfurt School intellectuals started teaching in Californian universities and found that groups such as \textbf{L\textbf{G\textbf{BT}}} people and blacks lapped it up, as it was biased in their favour, and involved silencing people who were viewed as 'oppressive' i.e. white people - coincidentally almost all of the Frankfurt School intellectuals were Jewish. Critical theory is now commonly used by SJWs and the left. Basically it is a meaningless word salad, full of projecting, half truths, buzzwords, personal bias, self victimization and pseudo-psychology. Despite having little to no basis in reality, it is now taught to college students as fact.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small +Jorge GomesOf course, if a single person were to attempt to save one person when two people are drowning *at the same time*, there is no right or wrong choice regarding which one you save (but that's kind of the point–geography makes it no more or less moral).  However, the analogy was not about having to choose one or the other within a set time frame (which you've added), which is a slightly different philosophical problem akin to the Trolley problem. This dilemma addresses whether geography has any impact on the morality of a single act. Your addition to the problem of a time constraint and choice removes the possibility of helping two people who might be drowning at different times. However, I would argue that \textbf{nationalism} is a kin not only to saving the first girl but taking her to the movies and buying her a coke and a puppy while actively drowning the girl six metres away. It's near impossible for nationalist self-interest to not result in harm to others as evidenced by history. We've had several hundred years of \textbf{nationalism}, I would argue that colonialism is the inevitable result of \textbf{nationalism} when countries venture outside their own borders in order to serve their own interests (whether for gold, oil or slaves). The two world wars in the last century were fuelled by the fires of Western hegemony and the need to assert a national self-interest. The search for assets to support an ever growing population results in harm to others. I would assert those very few nations in the West were able to sustain their countries without invading or marginalizing others. The alternative is to be marginalized by another \textbf{nation} or to adopt the kind of \textbf{nationalism} akin to North Korea, which raises a whole series of other ethical issues. Given its Nuclear program, however, I see little evidence that its behavior as a nationalist \textbf{nation} is any different to all the others. The third option is globalisation–the UK's decision to join the EEC, for instance, was financially motivated at a time when the UK was known as the sick man of Europe. +Matthew 2504 but it isn't our responsibility to help themMorality is the principles concerning the distinction between right and wrong or good and bad behaviour. We generally accept that allowing harm is less bad than being the perpetrator of harm but allowing someone to come to harm is less moral than helping them, standing by and watching a child drown is objectively immoral.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Des Oliver In an ideal world scenario non of the girls will be drowning never mind having to face the moral choice of who to help. In the real world the resource constraints present will ensure that the choice becomes a practical one, you help those that you are most likely to salvage.Not everyone will be able to be helped in a equitable fashion over the surface of the globe any attempt to implement this idealogical concept will fail,this doesn't mean that you should not help underdeveloped regions of the world just that we do it in a realistic fashion.I live in a 'Third World ' region were Oceans of poverty surround Islands of wealth and these same discussions pervade our politics but it is interesting to observe how the ruling political/academia/business  elite -(all agknowledged SJ idealogues ) expect the ordinary tax paying citizenry to make ever increasing sacrifices to obtain 'Social Justice' while they don't 'walk the talk ' themselves.All the time they gleefully strip large portions of the public purse and foreign aid into their own pockets(Evil  Western nations taxpayers contributions ) while decrying \textbf{Nationalism} /Colonialism and espousing Socialism .I can guarantee you that the ruling elite in most of the regions where millions of children died didn't have a single sleepless night about them and probably even helped in causing their deaths.

My original question was why is patriotism moral. I posed this question originally because the OP implied that it was somehow the 'right' choice. This seems to be something that people believe, but there's still been no justification as to why it is moral. Your characterisation of the real world doesn't make the actions or inactions of those nations anymore or less objectively moral. I can guarantee you that the ruling elite in most of the regions where millions of children died didn't have a single sleepless night about them and probably even helped in causing their deathsI appreciate you are attempting to make a wider point but this comment (and those leading up to it) teeters on the relative privation fallacy. Assuming your statement is true, how does that make our inactions any more or less moral? Then we have the Globalist agenda -a small group of Multinational Corporations governed by an even smaller group of multi billionaires consolidating most of the World's wealth in their hands, do you think they are going to ensure equitable distribution of resourcesThis is probably the smartest thing I've read on this thread so far. What we disagree on is the label used to describe these inherently aggressively capitalist organisations. These have arisen partly as the result of an impotent government unable to vet these enormous organisations, whose activities often fall outside of the country's jurisdiction. How do we ensure that they function to serve the will of the people? What confuses me is the characterisation (or implication) of this enormous capitalist, free market motivated machines as 'socialist'.  I agree these organisations exist. I also agree they are a problem. The question is what do we do about it? What mechanism would we have that could stand up to these organisations? What impact has \textbf{Brexit} or Trump had on reversing these enormous global empires, many of which exist outside their country's laws? Let's take a hypothetical: If Texas decided to raise its tax on companies then a large national corporation could simply move its main base of operations across state lines. That way, it can evade those aggressive tax laws and move to another state which is more favourable towards the 1. The only way that you can ensure this company (we'll call it BigCorp) doesn't take jobs out of Texas but pays reasonable levels of tax is to introduce state wide legislation. However, statewide legislation means that states are now bound together in a way they were not before. This analogy attempts to show the dilemma of globalisation (and perhaps the more recent \textbf{Brexit} debacle).

Rwanda is now a more stable country than it was at the time of its genocide.  It's like when people keep going on about Transatlantic slavery whilst ignoring that blacks in Africa introduced the concept whilst also ignoring that whites ended it in the WestA fallacy of relative privation. How does slavery of blacks in Africa make the enslavement of Africans by Europeans less immoral? When we convict murderers in a court of law, do we lessen the sentence if it transpires that the same crime was committed by other people somewhere else? We tend to focus on Western hegemony, colonialism, and slavery because its scale went far beyond anything before, whose effects can still be felt today. Which European nations were colonized by Chad in the last two centuries? Much of the conflict in the Middle East can be traced back to the geographical borders drawn up during British imperialism (or the British occupation as I like to call it) designed entirely to serve British interests. We generally don't give extra credit to people who decide to stop committing crimes. The default position is not to commit the crime in the first place. When we speak of patriotism, we're not focusing on the ills of the past but rather the wealth of progression and accomplishments that have been made...and has been earned off the backs of others, ignoring the harms, rape, enslavement, oppression, theft, deprivation imposed on less violent groups, which is by definition immoral.
