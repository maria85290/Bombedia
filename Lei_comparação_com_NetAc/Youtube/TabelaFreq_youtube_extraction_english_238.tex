  \cellcolor{green!27}\small It wasn't their land. They had small parcels of land that they could make a claim to because that's where they spent most of their time and where they had their ancestors buried. But that was not the entire continent. There were never more than 10 million native North Americans even at the absolute height of their population, and that includes Canada and Alaska as well. They were a stone \textbf{age} people without roads, the wheel, literacy, and only a handful of permanent settlements. By and large, the vast majority of the continent was not 'theirs.' Even the idea that they could control that much land was a foreign concept to them. Obviously, some whites did some very bad things, and Native Americans suffered for it, but its not as if this violence was entirely one sided. Americas first school massacre was the Enoch Brown massacre when a group of Delaware Native Americans slaughtered a school full of children, and enslaved some of the survivors. A week before hand they killed a white pregnant women and cut out her unborn child. There was a reason why some called the natives 'savages.' And the idea of anyone from East or South East Asia looking down on Americans for conquering stuff is laughable. All humans conquered other humans in the days before the Industrial Revolution. The only thing that sets white people apart from the rest of the world is that we questioned these ideas and have made an effort not to repeat the mistakes of the past.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Redeemed, I liked your reply.  I realize you are making a good point regarding the obnoxious lady's use of "hola." Obviously her use of the term has no bearing on the level of intelligence of Americans, but rather reflects her status as a Latina.  As a Latino,I am not saying all Latinos are as \textbf{racist} or obnoxious as this lady..  It is very troubling to see Huffpost and other media outlets (CNN, etc) posting this and similar stories on YouTube.  The intent of course is to inflame divisions in the USA.  The hope is that minorities will side with the DNC rather than the American Culture which has created so much opportunity for all people (despite all our flaws). The truth is that no society is free of bigotry.  Ask the untouchables in India, or the victims of the genocide in Rwanda, etc,  What saved me from being a SJW was visiting family in Central America during the reign of a Dictator. I had first hand experience with the alternatives to life in the USA.  The truth is the USA has created more opportunities for all its people than any other country..

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small What none of you mouth breathing morons are considering is that Native Americans never claimed the entire North American continent. They couldn't. There weren't enough of them for that, nor did they have the technology for it. They didn't have the wheel, they didn't have roads, or writing, they couldn't make a massive land claim like that, nor did they try. Hunter gatherer tribes can lay claim to a fairly large territory, but North America is huge, far too big for 10 million Native Americans to be omnipresent. South America is a completely different story, but when the first white settlers came to North America, there was more than enough room for everyone without people stepping on each other. Most interactions with natives were benign. The thing with Europeans though, they tended to lay down roots. They would build their farm on land that seemed unoccupied and they would stay there all year round. Most Natives weren't like that, most Natives were nomadic, and they moved from one camp site to another. A European may have built a farm in an area where a Native tribe passed through maybe once a year. The Native tribe wouldn't even make camp there, they would just move through the area. They didn't consider the area 'theirs' but they might still get angry at the sight of a European farmstead that hadn't been there before. Even in 1776 when the US was formed, the idea of controlling the whole continent was not something they considered feasible. Jefferson himself said it would take a hundred generations to fill the continent because he didn't foresee the industrial revolution and the advent of mechanized farming and modern medicine which would eventually lead to the human population exploding all over the Earth. Also understand that at this point, many white Americans had never been to Europe, nor had their parents, or grand parents. I've never been to Europe, and I have to go up several generations before I even come to the first \textbf{immigrant} in my family tree. I'm a white American and my ancestors helped build it into what it is today, and I'm not going anywhere.  Did the US do a lot of mean and unfair things to the Native Americans? Yes, yes we did, and there still needs to be some reconciling there. Do most of the tribes have most of what they considered 'their land,' yes, many of them do, they're called the reservations. No, Native American's didn't get all the land back that they once claimed, many of them were forcibly removed and placed on reservations. That wasn't right and something should be done about it. Did Native Americans do some awful things to white people? They sure did. Raping, killing, slavery, scalping, torture, sure, Native Americans did that, and they did it enough to earn them the title of 'savage.'My people came here mostly as settlers, and not conquerors, because from the European mindset, North America was a mostly empty land with a few tribes moving around the wilderness... because that's exactly what it was.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Immigrant & \cellcolor{green!5}Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/514 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.195 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Thank you for the sentiments, friends, but let me take a moment to clarify some facts. For "the first casualty in war is the truth", Pindar.The Chinese (my ancestry by the way, in case anyone wants to call the PC police) did eat dogs, and so did most cultures around the world. As a historian, I've noticed that diets among people change, and the chief driving factor is usually scarcity. This might explain why southern europeans eat mollusks, Southeast Asians eat bugs, Coastal people ate crabs and lobsters(bugs of the sea), etc. Communism has \textbf{nothing} to do with why the Chinese eat(not "ate") dogs. The driving factor more likely came from poverty from harsh historic times. Granted, Marx was Jewish, and arguably he had good ideas; however there are two things to keep in mind. Marx' understanding of world history was limited. He was more of a contemporary activist who observed the plight of the poor working class people in comparison to the rich who only collected the profits off the backs of the workers. He overlooked the fact that wealth gaps between the poor and rich have been a multi-millenia long problem. You can say communism was a narcissistically naive European attempt to explain the world based on its limited understanding of world history, very much like how many thought World War I was the "war to end all wars". On the other hand, Mao, seeing an opportunity for power, decided to utilize socialist ideology to muster support among the poor, uneducated downtrodden Chinese farming class during a period of economic strife and war. Mao merely adopted the ideology for his own ambitions. Notice he subsequently eliminated his successor chairmen to reinstate himself to power. By doing so, he also abandoned socialism. Instead, writing his little \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} book which was all about loyalty to him, and not about economic equality. The "\textbf{yank}" culture, originally British culture actually has a rich long, albeit messy history. British culture incorporates Celtic, Greco-Romano, and Germanic backgrounds, and English is one of the most bastardized languages on the planet. It incorporates elements form all of the above. Yes, the educated classes in post-Renassiance Europe did study ideologies from as far as China. For example, Napoleon was believed to have studies Sunzi's Art of War. But keep in mind, the majority of Europe's Renaissance came from a rekindled interest in the Greco-Romano classics. Vedic mythology was known to educated Europeans, but I can't recall and instance when they were applied/used. "DNA testing degenerate"? I'm a little lost here.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small D31 5M . What  kind of \textbf{racism} to white people experience ? A non white person condemning \textbf{racism} from whites towards non whites doesn't qualify as \textbf{racism} against whites . The reason whites don't  experience \textbf{racism} is because races such as  mestizos Hispanics or East Asians feel inferiority complex towards white people ! For instance in my family , several women consider that marrying a white man " improves " our \textbf{race}.. Now white people tend to be very proud about their \textbf{race}, they certainly don't feel inferior to non whites .. that's why whites are capable of being \textbf{racist} .\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Race, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}7/101 & \cellcolor{green!27}6.931 \\  \hline
