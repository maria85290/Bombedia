  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Solzhenitsyn explains it best: "You must understand. The leading Bolsheviks who took over Russia were not Russians. They hated Russians. They hated Christians.

It was an invasion and conquest over the Russian people. More of my countrymen suffered horrific crimes at their bloodstained hands than any people or \textbf{nation} ever suffered in the entirety of human history. It cannot be understated. Bolshevism was the greatest human slaughter of all time.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small lol while i do not agree with berating random people for simply being jews the effects of Jewish actions on the host \textbf{nation} are extremely damaging to whatever \textbf{nation} was willing to allow them in.. I have no idea why they are like this but its a pattern of behaviour that can be observed going back thousands of years and is the cause of so-called "antisemitism".. Were it not for this extremely destructive behaviour there would not be any notable presence of hostility towards jews.. Honest jews will admit this but most will not fearing the understandable backlash it most certainly is bound to ensure... I genuinely have no idea why they are like this but an honest and dedicated period of research into the evidence is unbelievable and shocking when the scope and gravity of the problem is realized... Its not something that would be easily believed by any decent person without the supporting evidence to prove it which is why most people have a knee jerk negative reaction to hearing such things, this and the fact that any criticism of these people and their effects on the society  has been deemed automatically a sign of mindless bigotry and \textbf{racism}. In any case the facts, unpleasant and confusing as they are remain quite shockingly blatant and obvious when one is willing to look at them. All this being said it must be stated that it would be ridiculous to claim ALL jews behave in such ways and have such detrimental effects on the world around them, the greatest tragedy is that those innocent people are most often the ones who are made to suffer the consequences of their malicious kin.. But why.. Why do they do this..... Asking this is like asking why evil exists.. At some stage the question becomes irrelevant and all that matters is defeating it. For a long time now we have believed large scale, organised  evil was something relegated to history and entertained as a fantasy in movies but more and more its become clear to an ever increasing number of people that such things do exist and scarier still each one of us is capable of it... Most evil people do not believe they are doing evil or have justified it as an acceptable option... History is now and we are its actors. \textbf{Nobody} can control the page they exist on only what they will do with the time they have.. I wish we could all love one another and do no harm to each other but sadly thats just not the way things are right now so we need to try and deal with the situation as best we can. God help us and maybe one day we will have true peace.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nation, Nobody, Racism & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}4/460 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.87 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I'm a Jew and I have a story for all the people out there who put NASTY HATEFUL THINGS IN THE COMMENTS. Having to put up with this everyday is terrible and shows that you are not decent people. Stay strong fellow Israelis and Jews. The sad thing is, if we weren't Jewish, you wouldn't hate us. You might even be our friend. But we wouldn't be friends with you cause your a terrible person. We wouldn't have to say this stuff if you just realized that each Jew is different and most are good some are bad. As with any religion, or non religious person. You saying all Jews are bad is the equivalent of saying, I met one person who wasn't religious and they were mean, so every non religious person is mean. Like, GET IT IN YOUR HEADS JEWS DID \textbf{NOTHING} WRONG AS A WHOLE. My story is below.So I was on the bus and an eight grader who i was friends with asked me what my favorite holiday was. I told him hannukah because I celebrate all Jewish holidays because I am Jewish. And hannukah is my favorite as it is in the winter, we get presents, you get to give presents, the food and games are great, it lasts for eight days, and we get to celebrate it with our family. Anyway, after telling him this, his name Is will, he goes, hannukah? What's that. And starts laughing hysterically. I tell him what it is and he starts making fun of me. Then a kid in front of us in my grade says, my favorite holiday is hannukah too. I start to smile, and then he says nah, I'm just kidding, hannukah, what the friking kind of holiday is that. After I got off the bus, it hit me hard, that some people were cruel and stupid and mean because they know \textbf{nothing} about the true Jew. That we are going each different. That people didn't hate me for me. They hate that I'm a Jew because they hate our kind. We are still people and we have feelings too. In the holocaust, six million Jews were killed by the nazis. Why? For no reason. Innocent people were killed and injured and sent to concentration camps. If your stupid enough to believe that Jews are bad, do some research and clean your self up abit. Truly, having to live like this everyday hurts me and it shouldn't. It shouldn't because people should be decent enough to realize we are all equal.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I would like to explain the reality here. I respect jews as people Infact so many of my family have Jewish names like Moses, Isaac , and so on. But when we talk about anti-Semitism. First go back to \textbf{old} Testament and see what is the meaning of Semite. Sam is the son of prophet Noah. So most of people in middle east share a \textbf{common} DNA like Arabs, jews and many minorities in middle east which means they are all Semitic people. So if you offended an arab or Jewish or rest of smaller middle eastern minority , that called an anti-Semitism. But Zionist movement used that term to only jews and excluded rest of other sametic groups which were not fair. So if you hate an arab you should be called an anti-Semitism but i guess doesn't work that way anymore.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Common, Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}2/143 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.399 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Food for thought for the Ante-Semite:'He who saves a life saves the world' is a quote from the Torah, thousands of years later it was paraphrased in the Koran. This statement's origins are undeniable. Had you been in a position to save the life of a physician who then went on to save many lives, in essence, through cause and effect you would not have saved just one life; but multitudes. It is arguable that had you been in a position to kill Adolf Hitler as a child, the opposite would be true and countless millions across Europe would not have perished. This, of course, is hypothetical but cause and effect has a vast impact on our lives.Anti-Semites follow a particular pattern – in the main are of low intelligence and are fascinated by conspiracy theories; (if suited to their purpose) which they eagerly adopt. The bearing of false witness is their predominant trait; passed down to them through the ages. As their antecedents were willing to bear false witness - so they have adopted the practice. This flouting of the Ninth Commandment is what their existence is based upon.  In the modern world, we also have pseudo Ante-Semites, jumping on the bandwagon; they are your \textbf{common} or garden trolls who in the main hate humanity in general; invariably  they have no life of their own and find gratification in hating all and sundry, masking their self-loathing in the process.Hatred of the Jews is primarily based on jealousy, the jealousy of success gained through hard work and ingenuity and a creed of helping each other; an eagerness to learn and to pass on that learning. The most famous Jew was of course Jesus Christ; who according to ancient history was born with these traits. From what moment in time do Ante-Semites find it acceptable to have a blanket hatred of Jews BC or AD? If it is BC then Christ's maternal grandparents, who were Jewish, would have been candidates for mindless hatred. The Irony of the Ante-Semites is that many of them would not exist today without the contribution that Jews have made to Medicine. If they themselves had not been saved by one of these medical breakthroughs; you can be sure that their antecedents would have been. Of course had their antecedents perished they would not exist.

One to Every Five Hundred People, amazingly they account for over 20 per cent of all Nobel Prizes won. Another astounding figure is that 50 per cent of all Champion Chess players are Jewish. If being intelligent is a crime - they are truly guilty.The Jews have survived many civilisations in over five thousand years, and although they might have suffered at the hands of their detractors, the civilisations that persecuted them were all rendered extinct. This includes in the last century the Nazis. The Jews have survived and wherever possible prospered, overall, their contribution to any society they have lived in has been immense and beneficial. It should come as no surprise that the descendants of Holocaust survivors will in a war situation fight a war of attrition. 'Never again' is their mantra. Most Jews would think a scorched earth policy was wrong but most Jews are not direct descendants of Holocaust survivors.In the past hundred years war has seen carpet bombing of Europe, Atom Bombs dropped on Japan and Napalm used in Vietnam. In the past two hundred years the indigenous people of the United States of America, Australia and Africa have been displaced by immigrants from the outside world who had no claim to the land whatsoever. The Arabs are tribal and have warred with each other for millennia, in 1948, 1967 and 1973 they conspired to act together and attack the State of Israel they lost all of these wars. Most of the indigenous Jews in these Arab countries were displaced and settled in Israel. Wars create refugees; it is part of the whole diabolical process.The world has never been an overly fair place. The absolutely regrettable plight of the Palestinian people could have been solved, many times over, in the past fifty years if the Arab potentates had used a small percentage of their oil income to ensure that each and every Palestinian was housed and had financial stability. They could build Dubai out of the desert but have allowed the Palestinians to remain refugees; as it suited their political ends in maintaining the status quo and keeping their kings and princes in power. A final word on Anti Semites: because of Jews inter-marrying over the past few hundred years, there are more than one hundred million part Jewish people on the planet, this heritage unknown to many of them. It would be advisable for every Ante Semite to take a DNA test so that they can be sure that their hatred is not being directed at their very own being; this has been found to be the case many times over.

As a scholar, psychoanalyst​, ​ and a princess Maria Bonaparte, stated in her article Le Myth du Juif-Satan in Mythes de Guerre (Paris 1950) this projection plays a specific function in anti-semitism (which is now rampant among ​ 1,600 millions of ​Muslims​ all over the world ​ as it was in \textbf{Nazi} Europe):  "More or less consciously, the anti-Semites project onto Jews all their evil instincts: Their thirst for blood, gold, luxury, debauchery.  Having liberated themselves from all that, they become clean in their own eyes and appear to be shining examples of purity.  Thus, the Jew is best suited to be that projection of the Devil.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The dislikes and comments on this video disappoint me but do not surprise me. It's the new trendy thing now to hate Jewish people. Anti-Zionists on the left and in some extremist Islamist ideologies associate conflict with Israel with all Jews and try to draw comparisons between the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the Holocaust, occasionally outright denying the Holocaust altogether. Meanwhile in right-wing circles, many kids now think it is "cool" to go on 4chan and support white \textbf{nationalism}, creating edgy memes to advocate for the death of all Jews and promote false conspiracy theories with typical anti-semitic tropes.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Anti-Semites follows a particular pattern – in the main they are of low intelligence and are fascinated by conspiracy theories, which (if suited to their purpose) they adopt. The bearing of false witness is their predominant trait; passed down to them throughout the ages. As their antecedents were willing to bear false witness - so they have adopted the practice. This flouting of the Ninth Commandment is what their existence is based upon.Their hatred of the Jews is based on jealousy, the jealousy of success through hard work and ingenuity and a creed of helping each other, an eagerness to learn and to pass on that learning. The most famous Jew was Jesus Christ; who according to history was born with these traits. The Irony of the Ante-Semites is that many of them would not exist today without the contribution that Jews have made to Medicine. If they themselves had not been saved by one of these medical breakthroughs; you can be sure that their antecedents would have been. Of course had their antecedents perished they would not exist.

I was not even aware that reciting kaddish for your deceased father could be something to be frowned upon. Seems downright impolite. Not surprising that the Israeli media hasn't exposed this radical belief system, but only because I am already aware of the long list of evidence of leftist prejudice due to their ignorant mentality of if they are incapable of understanding the logic of A thought process, therefore their must not be any logic to A thought process. Or they are of the other leftist sort who believe the people to be ignorant, fascist's, who would crumble into murderous and malicious outcasts of society if society should recognize that their beliefs on equality and coexistence were flawed and insufficient boundaries, punishments, and privileges in order to truly achieve peace, and enable stable, secure and progressive learning and economic development. The siege type lifestyle required of pretending equality without being able to achieve it and clearly requiring massive wealth redistribution with vast percentages of Jews not believing in the ‘strategy', and well aware and complaining about the media censoring their views, and the courts censoring their views, and the politicians betraying right wingers over and over again, while the majority of Jews of Israel stop believing in representative government altogether, rightfully due to the evidence, all to protect the Jewish left, and the American-euopean Jews and gentiles who require for all disagreement with inequality on the whole planet earth to be censored. Even if it constitutes A majority of the people of the world, which it does. The Jew and the gentile requires A real G-d, just as they require logic, our only option is to continue to point out the truth to them, no matter what keeps happening, have faith and remember, our G-d is eternal, as is our knowledge of His existence, their lies only need to break one more time for it to be impossible for them to ever go back to the ignorance of cause and effect and equality.

DESTROY BORDERS!!!!Both neocons and george soros and barbara specter fully support to destroy any and political borders so jews can push out all muslims from the middle east to asia and europe and america all so that the neocons can have their end time cult ideas to be worked apon to grab back their biblical borders and they can not do that if muslims are there.So now everyone who reads the above will now know why neocons are hated because they want to manipulate other countries and is also the reason why they have been kicked out of every country in world history.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/172 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.581 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small 3rays No I understand Arabic and am a Muslim and unlike many islamaphobic amateurs who watch a few videos and get exited, I knowledge in basic Islamic studies. Every verse Was revealed at a certain time period and that verse is NOT to instill terror in the minds of non-Muslims but to order Muslims to fight the combatants that are fighting them hence the word قتال which is used in the verse to describe the fighting of the combatant and Muslim. If many Muslims hate gays that is to do with them. Islam doesn't tell us to hate them for being homosexuals but that if they commit unlawful \textbf{sexual} intercourse, JUST AS IF a HETROSEXUAL does they will be punished. Also Islam has and does give many rights to women. They CHOOSE to cover up if they want to be a Muslim. How about asking a muslim \textbf{woman} one day. The covering up is also to give women the right to be treated the same as men and to not be treated based on their beauty ( which many women find VERY demeaning) it's also because they do not want to be catcalled and perved on and to have modesty and self respect based on what's on the inside not outside.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small nahHere's what really happened (the Gospels are lies):Jesus and Judas made a deal that Jesus would die at the hands of Rome in order to save humanity or some shit. The Jewish priests are scared that if Jesus keeps preaching his dirty liberal shit, Rome will take away their land and the Temple. Meanwhile, Pilate hears about Jesus and thinks, "Oh shit, if this guy manages to gain a big enough crowd, he will cause a Jewish rebellion against Rome. I must kill that motherfucker." Anyway, Jesus sent Judas to tell Pilate to get him killed. The priests sent their own angry mob to find Jesus, but then they joined with the Roman crowd. Jesus is arrested in Gethsemane and taken directly to Pilate, who tortured Jesus and sent him to the Sanhedrin. There, they all vote that Jesus is guilty, but because the vote is unanimous, they let him go (the Sanhedrin actually worked like that). Pilate is furious and tells Caiaphas "If you don't kill this man, then you are no friend of Caesar!" So by morning, Pilate and the priests present Jesus to a crowd, but then the crowd immediately want him released. Among the crowd are some of the disciples, notably Mary Magdalene (yes, she was a disciple). Anyway, Pilate was like "This man refuses to pay taxes to Caesar, claims to be King of the Jews, and attracts a large crowd! And he's a filthy rebel who will lead the Jews against Rome!" Then Caiaphas declared that Jesus was innocent, but Pilate ain't having that shit. The crowd is furious, screaming "Release Jesus! Release Jesus!" while the soldiers and Centurions are like "Crucify him! Crucify him!" Claudia tells Pilate to release him due to a nightmare, but Pilate replies with "Fuck off, \textbf{woman}!" because he was a monster. Then Pilate orders a centurion to fetch Jesus Barabbas, and then throws him at the crowd, saying "You want Jesus? Here, you can have him!" Then Pilate orders Jesus be crucified, and then he turns to the crowd and says, "I am innocent of this man's blood. He is your responsibility now. His blood shall be upon you and your children", but the crowd is like "NO U, PILATE! YOU'RE THE MONSTER WHO KILLED THIS MAN", but Pilate leaves. He then gives Jesus the pieces for the cross, and makes him carry it to Golgatha (people sentenced to crucifixion had to make their own crosses), and then once he makes it, he gets nailed to the cross with some people watching, including Magdalene and his mother. Hell, a Roman soldier even scoffs at Mary and says "\textbf{Woman}, behold, thy son!" while laughing. A few days pass, and Caiaphas sees Jesus on the cross and says, "Truly, this man was the son of David." He also stays on the cross, left as an example by the Romans to the Jews: "Don't fuck with Rome, or this could be you."\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/493 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.406 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Semitism is actually a "\textbf{racist}" concept and therefore anti-semitism is "anti-\textbf{racist}"... funny how that works.A quick search in encyclopedias reveals that the idea of a 'Semitic people' is a racial term popular in the 19th and early 20th centuries, important in establishing the history of these ancient \textbf{ethnic} groups (Source: Wikipedia).The origin of the term "Semitism" in fact comes from the biblical "SHEM" (Hebrew) the name designates one of the three sons of Noah in the Book of Genesis. The term (originating in 1770 by members of the Göttingen School) then makes reference to a culture and \textbf{race} of a "chosen people" that have a closer connection to God than any others. One can suggest that these efforts to elevate (or distinguish) one's own "people" in this way smack of arrogance, elitism, prejudice against other people and gave rise to antisemitism.Antisemitism doesn't then refer to anti-Judaism (in a religious context), or anti-zionism (which would be Israel people or its defenders)... only a would-be racial supremacist ideal of Jewishness. So when you hear "antisemitism" from pundits just ask them what doctrine they actually defend.Harry Ostrer, Jewish Professor of Genetics even demonstrates that "Shem" refers to a Jewish \textbf{race} found in DNA for more info on that you can check the following links:- "\textbf{Race} or Religion? Jewish Genes Identified": [LINK] - "Legacy: A Genetic History of the Jewish People": [LINK] So the simple definition of "anti-semitism" would be "anti-racism" if semitism defends racial dogma, ideals or doctrines - in any way or form.And it's clear some today equate the SHEM gene with "semitism" as a distinct jewish \textbf{ethnic} identity and \textbf{race} even down to DNA levels...So the definition is still being re-written.For further research on the subject (and if you still doubt \textbf{race} is the issue):Shem genealogies (bloodlines) is found in Genesis and those believing these scriptures to be historically accurate profess:Shem is the father of the Semitic \textbf{race}; Japheth is the father of the Japhetic \textbf{race}; Ham is the father of the Hamitic \textbf{race}.The "Book of Jasher", published by Talmudic rabbis in the 17th century also provides further insight as how countries and regions are all divided accoring to "\textbf{RACE}".-"Genealogy of Shem": [LINK] -"Geographic identifications for the Sons of Noah (Green=Shem, Red=Japheth, Blue=Ham)": [LINK] \normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnic, Race, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}10/385 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.597 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small +Teo Jordan if u do some reading regarding Islam u will find that the only reason jews were hated by mohamad was because they refused to convert to islam . As jews and christians were seen as people of the book (legitimate religions from God), mohammad needed them inorder to legitimise his pagan arabian religion and fuse it with the \textbf{old} testament or torah teachings. Because they refused, the jews practically were saying to anyone who was gonna convert to islam that they ( the jews) did not believe that mohammad was the awaited messiah. This mean mohammad's islam would not be seen as a legitimate religion and thus an offshoot of judaism and christianity...which it wasn't anyway. MOhammad was so pissed off by this that he ordered the massacre of the entire male population of the jewish tribe in medina which ironically were the ones who protected him from his own arabian tribe, the Quraish, when they wanted to kill him for wanting to start a new religion. All the women and children of that jewish tribe were sold into slavery. You will find all this info if you just google all the info i gave you. Also you will note that the last revealed chapter of the \textbf{quran}, chapter 9 (the \textbf{quran} does not follow as chapter 1,2,3,4,5,6 etc..as how things were revealed. Chapter was infact the last revelation that mohammad gave and therefore the most important one and the one that takes precedence to follow as the most recent..(in islam there is a thing called the law of abrogation. That being if two verses are in contradiction of eachother, the latter takes precedence. So for example in the early days of islam mohammad talked about peace and tolerance n only kill when attacked..however in later verses he openly calls to muslims to kill infidels. Because these verses came after the peaceful ones, they are the ones which must be obeyed.)...anyways chapter 9 talks to muslims that they must kill jews and christians wherever they find them, even when hiding behind a rock....This is the whole reason why jews and christians are hated in islam. Basically it's mohammad's 1400 grudge that he made into a religious "revelation". So for 1400 years muslims have been ordered to kill them because in truth, mohammad felt betrayed that they didn't convert to islam...    like i said..all the info i gave you..you can google or even read in sahih bukahri, sahih muslim ( the quotes and actions of mohammad which are what muslims live by..i.e by his example.) and the \textbf{quran}...\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Old, Quran & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Religious Identity - Muslim & \cellcolor{green!5}4/429 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.932 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The passage you are referring to is talking about how Jesus told the rabbis that were executing the \textbf{woman} that they should not do this just to make themselves look better than evil. He is also telling them in thinking that, they have been deceived. Satan had deceived them into thinking that they should execute the sinners in order to look high and mighty. Jesus said that this is not the works of Abraham. He was also implying that Abraham, who was Jewish, was merciful. So if they were truly doing the works of Abraham, they would be practicing mercy. Instead, they had believed a lie told by Satan. If Jews were truly of the Devil, then Jews like Abraham and David would not have been worshiping and obeying God. Jesus was saying "I am not like you men. I am not of sin. I am here to take the sacrifice and punishment of your sins.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small OK. My point is Jesus was not saying that the entire Jewish religion was of the Devil. The rabbis that were stoning the \textbf{woman}, Jesus was talking to them and said that THEY have been deceived and were doing the Devil's work. Not by stoning the \textbf{woman}, but by being hypocrites. Jesus was calling them out on their hypocrisy. They thought that they could do whatever it is that they wanted to do as long as they were punishing other wicked people. He was not calling out just the Jewish people, but the people who were being hypocrites. It is the hypocrites have accepted the Devil. Not every Jewish follower was doing this. He was not saying Jews were of the Devil. He was saying hypocrites are of the Devil. And in that exact moment, the ones who were being hypocrites just so happened to be the rabbis, and the audience cheering them on.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/154 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.299 \\  \hline

Reason 1 there hated by both Christians and Muslims (2 biggest religions in the world ) both sides have different reasons for hating on Jews , the Christians hate them because Jews killed Jesus who was in fact a Jew himself so little ironic , but the Muslims hate Jews mostly because of the Israel occuption of the Palestinian west bank for the last 60 years or so and also because Jews say Jerusalem is there holy city but Muslims say no its there holy city so at the end of the day its like mostly to due with religion and backgrounds .

Honestly, this doesn't surprise me at all, that someone else joined in to defend a clerk who was being so blatantly Anti-Semitic. We were blamed for the death of Christ, we were seen as unclean or unfit. Hell, people even used to think we caused the \textbf{Black} Death, because fewer Jews died (this is due to the fact that washing and hygiene is a big part of our tradition and that deterred the spread of germs, which they didn't know about back then).  And a lot of the same rhetoric continues today, with the lovely addition of people (like the commenter above) actually comparing Jews to Hitler, blaming us for the Holocaust, and denying that the Holocaust ever even happened.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!27}1/185 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.541 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small +Siham Al Ramahi Thank you for your comment :) American Jew.  I do my best not to judge anyone until I've met them, but you seem to have a good soul.  The conflict in Israel is terrible.  The zionists did steal the land, but mainly (I would assume) because as jews we're raised to believe the holy land belongs to us, so they took our land back after years of exile not caring about the others living there.  They must have figured there were so few jews after the war and we needed a land to call a jewish state.  Was it wrong to steal the land back, of course.  Broken commandment some would say, others would argue that it's our birthright and the land always belonged to us and always shall.  I'm torn myself whether I agree with it or not.  I would love for everybody to be able to live together, but a lot of people aren't willing to discuss terms.  Killing innocent civilians is wrong and terrible, from both sides.Anyway, hopefully peace will one day return to the land, without the extremists and soldiers killing everybody.

I mean, a Jewish state shouldn't exist, but I also think the same of Christian and Muslim states. I have a problem with Zionism and people who think it's their destiny to own land. Most Jews are peaceful and just like everyone else, but when a sole State that is supposedly representing Judaism as a \textbf{nation}, then the act of ethnically cleansing the domestic population will be attributed to Jews in general as an act of aggression.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Queen A Why is only Christianity wrong?They're all wrong, obviously. I was just specifically talking about christianity here. There are countless sources of scientific data that proof none of what's written in the bible has actually happened. There's either not a single shred of proof of it or the events that are described in the bible should have left such marks on the world that the fact that we can't find any of these gives it reason enough to refute it.But just look at history, we know that the 1st testament was build from \textbf{common} 'stories' from the region. A group of counselors actually sat down and decided what stories to keep and what stories to throw away. They'd fill in the \textbf{common} names used in the bible like god, jesus and friends. That's why so many verses contradict one another, because they're from different sources, from different people, with different ideas on what they think god is like. You can't slap the name god on both and think you're going to get away with it. This is not a concept, this is fact, there are documents describing this process is in detail, but don't let \textbf{old} ancient documents fool you. There are other gods from the same region, who also happened to have virgin births, walked on water, died and resurrected 2 days later, etc. But I'm sure you've never heard of these gods before, as Christianity is a scam desperately trying to suppress any actual knowledge that might lead to the obvious doubt you will have if you looked just 1 cm beyond your own nose. But again, what makes all religions false, is that they all make claims, without evidence to back up these claims. For so long we didn't know any better and it was \textbf{common} to just assume god was real. Critical thinking is a relative new concept in our society, but we should have adapted by now. We have the internet, we can look everything up.

If you want to become famous, you write more books in that gap, because god was talking all the time, so it would be odd if he was quiet at once. So a lot of stories are written. all these stories are later on compared and if stories for example only are removed/added in one version of the bible, it's most likely that that story is wrong, so it's removed.It's possible that "thrue" stories are removed, but there can't be added wrong stories, because then in almost every biblestory it needs to dive up. Next to that, it's actually more considered as a fact if a lot of believes have the same segments in it (virgin births, walk on water, died and resurrected in 2 days etc.).What religions makes false is the lack of evidence? I tend to believe that a believe is a believe because of believing, so without having facts...and a 2000 \textbf{old} year thing, thats indeed outdated, just like the earth ;-)About the Islam, jews and Christianity, in a nuthell, it's a sequence:-at first, the people choose aigainst God, so they need a sevior.- The jews are waiting for the sevior to come.- the christianity believe he has already come, in the form of Jesus.- The muslims believe in jesus also, but it was just a prophet.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@thijs de haan "it's generally accepted by historicy that Jesus lived."Not at all. Scientists are willing to adhere to the idea that a man named Jesus might have lived at some point, but his existence and importance has most likely been near infinitely overblown and exaggerated."Can you show proof that the stories are fake and the names are just \textbf{common} names?"Please go back to school and actually learn how the scientific process works. Burden of proof lies always with those who make the claim. There's no evidence Jesus has ever existed. People didn't start writing about it him until 100 years after his existence. Especially in those days where the average \textbf{age} was 40, this would have been a story written down after being passed down 2-3 generations. When people sit in a circle and whisper a single word in each other ear, you'll already get a completely different word by the time the word reaches the original whisperer. Now imaging passing down the entire story of Jesus over a period of 100 years. No, it's most certainly not going to be accurate. Can you prove that the story is true and not some imagination of people in the middle east? Can you prove that the story remained 100 accurate by the time it was written down? Can you prove that Jesus had actually existed despite 'no evidence has ever been found confirming his existence'?You'd think someone of that significance would have countless landmarks to prove he existed. In history, landmarks have always been the most reliable fact. We know for example that the cradle of civilization, well over 5000 years ago, came specifically from baghdad. That's pretty much the first scientific fact we have in history, and it's a landmark. Now back to jesus, he has none. This is typical to made up stories. "I tend to believe that a believe is a believe because of believing, so without having facts..."Yes, faith is believing something to be true without any evidence to support it. It's coincidental also the definition of a delusion, what's your point? I don't think we should treat faith as anything special just because people want to put a lot of weight on religion.

How are they SO bad that other races can look down at them? To be quite honest I have a deep love and affection for them.

They have pushed throughout history against massive misfortune, hatred, and obstacles that would destroy nearly any other \textbf{race} and yet they're still here!

Only the Israelite  ancient Jews were Semites and they were massacred by the Roman Empire for them revolting against their rule. In fact, they are lost and now are known as the lost tribes of Israel. Most of the Jews today are Ashkenazi \textbf{ethnicity} meaning their \textbf{race} is northern Caucasus before the Russians took it over. In fact, they are a Turkic tribe speaking a Turkic dialect which eventually adopted Judaism to distinguish their kingdom from other faiths in the world.

This stems from the belief that a strong  secular government is the best protection from religious fanaticism, especially Christianity.I've worked with German, Austrian and French Jews mostly and they switched from center-left to hard-right during the last 10 years. Mostly due to the fact that the political left is snuggling up too closely with Islam. Even some in the \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} community are starting to switch allegiances. Feminists are, from what I can tell, still left wing all the way and ignore Islam's treatment of women or even view the headscarf as a symbol of a woman's right to choose (which is always a good thing, as long as it goes against Western ideals).The future here will be quite interesting. Already we are seeing an alliance between Christian conservatives, hardcore atheists, nationalists and jews on places like pi-news (Germany's biggest political blog with 100000 readers a day).\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gay & \cellcolor{green!27}Sexual Identity - General, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality & \cellcolor{green!27}2/170 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.176 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Barack Obama Awkward situation with the whole islamism thing. I only ever judge people on their individual words and actions, not broader labels, but the trouble is we keep attacking islamic countries whilst at the same time being ultra careful and PC with how we treat them at home. Because our governments are such massive hypocrites (bombing for peace, spreading 'freedom' by unleashing sectarian civil wars in poor countries), they lose the moral authority to object to some of the more insane islamic values. One the one hand we get cringing apologetic speeches and new mosques, and on the other  strict surveillance, rising tides of anti-islamic \textbf{racism} and continual occupation and bombing of islamic countries. Basically if you wanted to create islamic extremism in the West, that's how you'd do it. I'd say they've done everything short of arming them, but yeah, they've done that too. Now that might come off as anti-islamic, but it's not. I am an atheist and a secularist, so I don't really see eye to eye with anyone who's deeply religious, but what religion they actually follow has little to no effect on whether I'll like them on not. What I think should happen is not some kind of purge of muslims as many right-wingers seem to want, but to stop going about fucking up their countries and start doing some good in the world. Only then will we as a group of nations have the moral security to say 'that may be your tradition, but you can't do it here' to things like child brides, FGM, sharia courts etc. Isolated \textbf{ethnic} enclaves are always a bad thing, but you can't blame many muslims for seeking identity in their religion when it becomes clear that their host country is corrupt and hypocritical and much of the population is \textbf{racist} against them.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnic, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/306 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.98 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@awc222 Wrong. The Khazar claims has been routinely debunked by geneticists. A study of haplotypes of the Y-chromosome, published in 2000, addressed the paternal origins of Ashkenazi Jews. Hammer et al.[108] found that the Y-chromosome of Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews contained mutations that are also \textbf{common} among Middle Eastern peoples, but uncommon in the general European population. This suggested that the male ancestors of the Ashkenazi Jews could be traced mostly to the Middle East. The proportion of male genetic admixture in Ashkenazi Jews amounts to less than 0.5 per generation over an estimated 80 generations, with "relatively minor contribution of European Y chromosomes to the Ashkenazim," and a total admixture estimate "very similar to Motulsky's average estimate of 12.5." This supported the finding that "Diaspora Jews from Europe, Northwest Africa, and the Near East resemble each other more closely than they resemble their non-Jewish neighbors." Stop trying to sound smart by arguing semantics.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Well, well, well, "Mr Pregnant - Atelston Fitzgerald Holder 1st", you appear to be necessitating a detailed commentary with logical reasoning to assist you in your ability to fully comprehend the manner in which this television program is recorded.  Fortunately for you, I happen to be an autistic individual, and just one of the multitude of wonderful and beautiful advantages about being neurodiverse in the exact manner that I happen to be is that we autistics have tendencies towards being detail-oriented and being enhanced in our logical thinking skills.  There are, of course, a multitude of people on this planet that posses these personality traits, and these personality features are, as we all know very well, not exclusively for autistic people.  However, we happen to have a greater likelihood of being very logical and of taking notice of details that the majority might not notice the way that we notice them.  Because you appear to be fascinated by large words and by obscure words, I am planning to make use of my extensive vocabulary in my commentary to you, and it is to your advantage, in this exact manner, that I happen to posses such an extremely advanced vocabulary, as you appear to be utterly infatuated with vocabulary that contains words that posses plenty of length and words that posses a great amount of obscurity (rather than more ubiquitous words).This television program, titled, "What Would You Do?", is, indeed, a television series that contains fictional plotline scenarios, and, therefore, contains character roles within the aforementioned scenarios that are fictional - that is to say, the actors and actresses in this program often would never truly behave and believe in the manner of the character they play.  This much is the part that you obviously understand, and I congratulate you on your ability to at least have knowledge of this particular detail.  As with all fictional tales portrayed onto video, the actors and actresses on this television program perform various roles such as the antagonist, the main protagonist, and occasionally I have witnessed episodes of this show that have a primary protagonist and a secondary protagonist rather than solely one single main protagonist.  There was one episode of this program that I viewed that had a tritagonist, as well, however, that particular episode failed to strike my fancy as much as the majority of the episodes of this show.  I have yet to see another tritagonist since that episode, but because tritagonists tend to have important storytelling roles in the plotline, I hope to witness another tritagonist on this program as part of the cast of characters in the plotline in the future.You appear to be confused on the detail of what this program is, and, in addition to that particular detail, you also appear confused about the nature of the responses towards the fictional plotline that are given by the community surrounding the fictional incident.  I shall assist you in identifying these very important details, and do so in a very detail-oriented and logical manner that utilizes my extended and sophisticated vocabulary that includes a wide array of words, many of which posses great length and obscurity.I will begin by stating the fact that this television program is not technically "satire".  Satire happens to be something entirely different from what this program is.  A satirical program utilizes techniques such as clearly identified sarcasm, extreme exaggeration that is oftentimes almost to the point of appearing similar to the exaggeration often found in hand-drawn animations, similarity-based comparisons of various ideologies that contain the basic components of an argument seen in certain portions of reality to pretend to argue for a position that is equal to the one being argued against with the satire, humor based on all of these components of satire, and fictional plotlines without any true reality in them.  However, this television program does not have all of the necessary qualifications for the definition of satire.  While this television series does, indeed, occasionally include some amount of exaggeration in the plotline details, it rarely contains exaggeration that is largely outside the bounds of what could be reality, and the exaggeration sometimes utilized within the fictional plotline portion of this television program is never there for humor purposes.  Usually, when the plotline contains exaggeration in this program, the exaggeration is not an exaggeration of reality, per se, but rather an exaggeration of typical reality in the portions of the aforementioned reality that contain the scenarios expressed in fictional format with this program's plotlines.Another detail that I would be glad to explain to you is the nature of community responses on this program.  While the scenarios themselves are fictional, the community members surrounding the scenarios are not.  They are legitimate reactions to what the people in the vicinity genuinely believe is a real occurrence rather than a scripted television program's episode segment.  The reason they believe these scenarios are actual occurrences is due to the fact that they legitimately could be genuine scenarios rather that fictional.  You can view this type of scenario on a news program, believe it or not.  The types of occurrences presented in fictional format on the program "What Would You Do?" are, unfortunately, \textbf{common} occurrences in reality.  This is actually why they produce this program in the first place: because they feel the need to view what exactly community members surrounding a particular circumstance would do if they were to be in the vicinity of an event of this type when it was occurring.  A realization of this detail will assist you greatly in your life, I'm sure.In conclusion, \textbf{nobody} is being "exploited" in this television series.  Exploitation would be if the creators were to, for instance, create a scripted scenario and then point out fault in community responses when there is none merely for the sake of receiving monetary value and heightened popularity.  Since they avoid performing actions such as the examples that I mentioned, they are not being exploitative in any way, shape, or form.  Good day to you, sir, and have a wonderful and enjoyable experience in browsing the rest of the internet.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Common, Nobody & \cellcolor{green!27}Age -
