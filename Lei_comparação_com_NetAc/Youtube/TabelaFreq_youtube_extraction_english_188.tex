  \cellcolor{green!5}\small fucked up facts against that fucked up drinking \textbf{age}Fact 1. Drinking affects the growth of the brain, which doesn't develop until 25Right, like all kids hit puberty at 13, and people over 25 with autism have fully matured and completely developed brains . Fact 2: More 18-20 year olds will drink and drive on the roadHere's the thing. That may be so, but you could lower the chances of drunk driving by creating a maximum drinking \textbf{age} stopping anyone over 60 from drinking, shouldn't we be watching what choices our elders make as well?If that is the case you should focus on the individual not the majority. Some 18-20 year olds don't even have a car. Also if I remember wasn't there plans to install breathalyzers into cars a while ago?Fact 3: Drinking among 18-20 year olds would encourage children too drink.Last time I checked, most kids don't look up to any 18-20 year olds unless it's Justin Bieber or another teen popstar. But they do look up to their parents who may or may not drink in front of them. So let's pass a law that stops parents from drinking in front of their kids.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/202 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.99 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small People need to understand what pedophilia is. Pedophilia is attraction to really young, underdeveloped children. Finding a 6 year \textbf{old} attractive is pedophilia, finding a well developed 16 year \textbf{old} attractive is NOT pedophilia its normal! Personally I do not advocate chasing after 6 year olds or children of similar \textbf{age} and development and I do not find such children attractive, but as for somebody who finds teenagers attractive, who doesn't? \textbf{Nothing} wrong with finding developed 16 year olds hot.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Nothing, Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!27}4/80 & \cellcolor{green!27}5.0 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I also feel strongly about \textbf{age} of consent laws, however, such an issue NYRA doesn't touch. There is this other youth rights organization called ASFAR (A Society Free of \textbf{Age} Restriction) which does deal with \textbf{age} of consent issues but reluctantly so since they don't want to become another NAMBLA. And NYRA's position on parental rights is only when the govt. interferes with parental rights. Although yes, child rights are what is most important.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/74 & \cellcolor{green!5}4.054 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@billybassman21  No, stricter laws are not one reason.

How about we don't tax anyone under 18 period, for anything. I mean if you you care what we have to say, why do you want our money?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small This guy thinks teenagers who work and pay income tax qualifies as "taxation without representation"...  That's bullshit.  If he were correct, child-hood stars would necessarily be guaranteed the right to vote.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@DroidEntertainment You're absolutely correct. One size does not fit all. A man of 30 can be as immature as a child of 16. That being said, a child of 16 is literally still physically and mentally maturing while the mind of a 30 year \textbf{old} has stopped. We aren't raising the voting \textbf{age} due to immature adults, but it makes no sense to make it open to people still mentally developing.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}2/71 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.817 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Description should read:Are young people being treated like the mentally and physically immature people they are?"Equality" sounds beautiful, but throwing it around at anything that moves is just ridiculous.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small It's truly ironic that \textbf{sex} offenders \& their potential victims alike are being branded with the scarlet letter on their driver's licenses. Curfews, the current drinking \textbf{age}, and the graduated license programs are definitely bullshit and need to be done away with. But the voting thing I don't know about. It seems that due to the current techniques of social control in place in the U.S. that rely on manipulating various animal instincts, which 16 year olds are more susceptible to, it's a bad idea.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Sex & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/85 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.353 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@mcoop221 I would guess because as a national law it is very reasonable. At the federal level, the \textbf{age} of consent is 16, with some exceptions when traveling from state to state. And it also has a 4 year rule for those who are 12-15, meaning that it is not a crime at the national level for a 15 year \textbf{old} to sleep with a 12 year \textbf{old} and so on. Some state laws are far less "reasonable", where 2 15 years-olds have \textbf{sex} is a very major crime, which is kinda \textbf{crazy}.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Crazy, Old, Sex & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}5/93 & \cellcolor{green!5}5.376 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Ickeriss69 But that misses the more underlining question of is setting the drinking \textbf{age} effective? As 90 of high schools say they have being drink, can we say it is working in any way. If you asked a group of people that where 25+ if that had a drink in the last 4 years, would you think it to be higher then 90? Read The Legal Drinking \textbf{Age}: Science vs. Ideology.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I'd say drinking \textbf{age} stays 21.  VOTING \textbf{age} goes to 21 or even 25.  I think you NEED real world experiences under your belt before being allowed to vote.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small For me, I started paying attention to politics when I was about 13 or 14, but then I would have voted for whoever my parents supported.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I don't know if I could support lowering the voting \textbf{age} to 16. That seems like a tough pill to swallow.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@alvincay100 Can these 16+ year \textbf{old} kids choose which parents will represent them?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small It isn't mentioned, but I think one of the most important rights is the right to WORK.  I had my first job at the \textbf{age} of 9, and it did me a great deal of good.  I learned about responsibility, how to treat customers, how to handle cash, I met some really neat people, AND I had spending money.  A year later my family moved and I wasn't able to get another job - and I certainly felt that loss.  I learned much in school, but for many youths I believe a job would be more important.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/97 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.031 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I don't agree 100, but certainly this needs more attention.  Beginners make beginner mistakes whether they are 10 or 50 - but they will generally recover more easily at 10.  Raising the drinking \textbf{age}  driving \textbf{age}  working \textbf{age}  etc. just means that people will be older when they make their mistakes, and that the older people who were not prevented from learning responsibility when they were young will think them irresponsible and - being American - want to punish them severely.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/84 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.571 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@nyrausa, If curfews have no positive effect, obviously there's no policy reason for them. But what is the constitutional argument against them? I assume the Equal Protection Clause doesn't get you there because youths aren't recognized by the Court as a protected class.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Just checked out their website. You can run to be a representative at \textbf{age} 25, but some people argue that the voting \textbf{age} should be raised to THIRTY!

\textbf{\Large Result analysis:}

\begin{itemize}\item Taking into account the words that were detected, we can reach the conclusion these comments are associated with : : Age - General;Age - Over 65s;Age - Youngsters;Gender - General;Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments;Nationality - General;%.

\item The percentage of hate speech related words is 1.6662.

\item Considering that the variable \textbf{Age - General} has the most occurences in the post, we can interpret that this is the predominant hate speech.

\item Overall there were 66/90 occurences of hate speech related comments.\end{itemize}\end{document}
