  \cellcolor{green!27}\small We don't like dumb-looking women, we like feminine-looking women. It's nasty feminists who tell women that in order to be respected by men you have to wear an attitude on your face and flash arrogance in your eyes; that's a LIE. Ironically, it's feminine women that men respect and want to care for, and it's certainly the feminist women who men believe to be stupid (and inorganic). It takes a certain kind of intelligence to act like a natural \textbf{woman}, especially these days with so much feminist rhetoric in every single movie/TV show/song/magazine.Maybe women shouldn't take advice about MEN from other women. Also, most Western women nowadays are disgusting whores and intellectual midgets - and thus should be avoided like a disease.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/123 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.813 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Hmm, this study is intresting yet valid and invaild in a way.the wording of that study was pretty unscientific, yet I see the intention behind it."Men find women who appear to be less witty as attractive, compared to the witty looking female" The reason behind this is that a man would find her to be 'easy' in a way of getting laid. But this study is invalid because it states that, " A man would be looking for a women to spread his seed. The false assumption is by that very statement, firstly a man wouldn't want to spread his seed to such a women in this day in \textbf{age}. He would only want to have intercourse with her and sense she 'appears' to be unintelligent she would be the best target. Also my question to the person who createdd such a false assuption would be this, "How would you tell if a women was intelligent or not by just looking at her instead of having a conversation?" Also pictures in the way women appear to look unwitty could also not be validated unless she were to be tested. Eiether way all men are pretty diffrent and such an assuption between apperance compared to intelligence is invalid and a women cant appear to be unwitty yet you chat with her and could tell.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/223 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.448 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The study was poorly worded and executed, but the basic premise has some truth to it.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Yeah, this study is quite flawed, but you are correct that if females are selective, and there are cues males can use to target the least selective ones, then it makes sense to do so. The general point that I'm trying to make is that evolutionary biology sometimes mixes up nature \& culture. Often, EBists assume that culturally ingrained behavior is hard wired.

Sperm competition is great for the males who are good at it, but not necessarily great for the females. For example, it would become a dominant strategy to be just good enough to survive, get laid, and pump the rest of your resources into super sperm.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Steve Oh, please read a little about evolutionary biology before you go spouting nonsense. Just because some cultures had permissive \textbf{sexual} roles for women doesn't mean that women aren't biologically programmed to be more discerning with their \textbf{sexual} partners.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Your premise is the conventional wisdom many evolutionary biologists recite, but much research shows that prehistoric women had \textbf{sex} w/numerous men \& had the sperm of multiple men inside them at once. In fact, many sperm serve as "blockers" that prevent other sperm from fertilizing, which tends to show that sperm of different men competes inside the uterus. Thus, women are not necessarily more 'selective' b/c the strongest sperm inside her wins out.

Men just want to have \textbf{sex}, yes! That's because the desire to have \textbf{sex} has led to more men wanting \textbf{sex}.

\textbf{\Large Result analysis:}

\begin{itemize}\item Taking into account the words that were detected, we can reach the conclusion these comments are associated with : : Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments;Gender - General;Age - General;Ethnicity - Native-American; Ideological and Political Identity - General;Ethnicity - Black;Age - Youngsters;Ethnicity - Asian (East- China, Japan, Korea, Philippines, Vietnam);Nationality - Chinese;Nationality - Japanese;Ethnicity - General;Nationality - Southern European;Physical Identity - Physical Features;Gender - Female sexuality;Age - Over 65s;Social Class - Working class;Behavioural Addiction - Alcohol;Gender - Female intelligence;Ethnicity - Asian (South- India, Pakistan, Bangladesh);Religious Identity - Muslim;Sexual Identity - General;Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality;%.

\item The percentage of hate speech related words is 2.3119.

\item Considering that the variable \textbf{Gender - General} has the most occurences in the post, we can interpret that this is the predominant hate speech.
