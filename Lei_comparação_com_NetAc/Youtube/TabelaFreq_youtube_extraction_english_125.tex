  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I'm 16 and I would say you start becoming older at 70 or more. Like my dad is 54 and he had me pretty late in life and I consider him to be miles away from '\textbf{old}.'

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The takeaway here that the video DOES NOT MENTION:  KEEP ACTIVE - Take care of yourself.  Obviously, these "older" folks pay some attention to what they eat and they keep physically and mentally active.  If you sit in front of TV/internet all day long and eat fast food, you can soon be in condition like someone in their 80's.  I've had a tai chi student once, who was in her 90's, who walked all over town, did JackLaLane vids at home, kept busy \& active, and she was \textbf{thin}, sharp, and had as much energy maybe better than some folks in their 50's.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I just turned 27 so younger than most of these millennials and I don't think 50-70 is \textbf{old}!!!

I know people my \textbf{age} who act \textbf{old} and sickly and then my mom who is 55 runs around with my dad who is 56 like they are a bunch of teenagers!

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Oh, California was, is, the most \textbf{ageist} place I've ever been. At forty and finishing a degree at UC Berkeley, which is mostly kids from Southern California, LA, trying to get away from their parents, it really messed up my exercise habits when they lied to me that I couldn't use the recreation facilities. Turned out they didn't think I was a student there. So you could say it was enforced bad aging, but what you gonna do, sue ‚Äòem in the usual California style? You know people there don't even do anything right, even their job, unless you sue them to do it. Not  a very cooperative, in fact rather polarized, society, and very obnoxiously \textbf{ageist}. And by the way, the \textbf{Apple} Store (in thankfully still slightly Texan Austin) that I go to, and \textbf{Apple} Support, has long considered me to be a power iPad user, so it's funny when people think you might not know how to use a smart phone iOS.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Watching this video evoked one question and thought : How do young people receive the information about how to think of older people ? One way is the media. Images and situations of older people through TV, movies, the medical profession, magazines, newspapers...Young people in general don't realize that you are vital and even better as you \textbf{age}. Flaws obtained through aging are projected as terrible things  with no cures and aging in America is sold as a disease. You have so many things wrong with you, buy our products or services. It is unfortunate that aging is not honored in the U.S. That aging is seen as shameful and stricken with illness and disease. That young people do not realize their life can end at \textbf{age} 18, 26 or 30. Being older does not mean sickness or death or looking ugly. Americans are brainwashed by society to think negatively about aging. Younger people will be fortunate if they reach an \textbf{age} to be proud of.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/166 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.807 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small It bothers me when millennials call people in their 50s \textbf{old}. But then, there was a time when I thought 30 was \textbf{old} so I can't blame them.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Someone's comment  made me realize what it is that really bugs me about this video. On the one hand, I think it's great to show that \textbf{age} doesn't necessarily limit people on what they can do physically. But there are a slew of us in our 50s and older (and younger, too) who deal with chronic illnesses and/or disability that precludes us being able to dance or do martial arts, or maybe even just walk around the block. Still, we are not "\textbf{old}" in the sense most people think of. We still have sharp minds, we can still have a rich inner life, we can still engage with and enjoy friends, be creative, continue to grow in so many ways, ways that do not require physical prowess or strength. It's the GROWTH that matters. As long as we keep growing inwardly, we are still "young". (Not that we need to define it with that term.) We are still VITAL. I think that's the best word for it. You don't get "\textbf{old}" in the negative sense until you lose your ability to choose life.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}3/183 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.639 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small When I was 8, I thought 15 was \textbf{old}. When I was 15-18, I thought 25 was \textbf{old}. Now that i'm in my early 20s, having learned alot about the world, I think 65+ is \textbf{old}. Our perceptions change as we gain knowledge and learn about the realities of the world. I think the reason why people think certain ages are \textbf{old} is based on false realities and stereotypes/generalized assumptions. For example, if you look at an average 45-50 year \textbf{old}, they are starting to gray out and become less functional, giving the perception that your 40s must be the \textbf{age} when you start getting "\textbf{old}" lol. However, this may be due to you not taking care of your health, not having enough fun, or taking on too much stress. I've met 60 year olds who look like they're in their 40s because they took care of themselves and avoid stress. This is why I no longer think anyone under 65 is \textbf{old} because you are still very functional and can still look young if you take care of yourself. I don't think you start getting \textbf{old} until you near 70, when you no longer have the energy to do as you please and your body starts deteriorating. However, I think even as you near 65, you shouldn't let this get to you and start to affect the perceptions you have of yourself. I think you should still be yourself, even if other people see you as "\textbf{old}" lol. Since I once considered myself to be "\textbf{old}" at the \textbf{age} I am now when I was younger, i'm sure other people younger than me may consider me to be "\textbf{old}" too. Yet this obviously doesn't affect me and my personality. I'll always be myself, no matter if i'm in my 20s or 50s or 70s.

And to the millennial-bashers, please keep in mind that we were them once, too. They're young, they're still learning many lessons and trying to make their way in the world.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Through ridiculous stereotyping of younger people, this video is apparently attempting to address \textbf{ageism} by promoting \textbf{ableism}. You see, young people should not respect, value, or appreciate older people simply because they can "still do yoga." Some older people (as well as some younger people) may have indeed lost some or all of their mobility. So? This video seems to suggest that those older people have lost their value because they would fail to impress a younger person with their ability to stretch or dance.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The smart millennials are the ones who understand that \textbf{age} does not define a person. These are the men and women who will be successful in life. People over 45 are not invisible and are some of the best teachers you will ever have in your lives! This also goes for employers in the workforce that seem to think they only need young blood in the building. Companies that hire all ages will be around the longest because they get it! This includes all these new millennial businesses as well. It's not all about 18-35...Why not learn from people who have walked the walk of life? Yes, I'm \textbf{old} but I still have a lot to learn and have many experiences to teach others. It's not easy being a talk show host on YouTube with the young viewership freely making their opinionated comments, but I still persevere because I want to help others avoid making some of the life choices and mistakes that I did.

At first I cringed at this video, then I liked it, then I thought, well, this still doesn't really change the negative misperception of "\textbf{old}", it just changes the perception of how \textbf{old} "\textbf{old}" is; and that perception is based on physical ability--at least all of the examples in the video are about defying \textbf{age} in terms of physical ability. There are many people, including myself, whose physical abilities are hampered by disease or other chronic illness, so we might not have the physical stamina of someone 10 or 15 years older than us. And, there are plenty of people who can't do pushups or jumping jacks or dance like Donald O'Connor, or run the NY marathon at \textbf{age} 25. Why do we even have to characterize "\textbf{old}" in terms of ability or non-ability to engage in physical endeavors? Each of us at any \textbf{age} has special gifts that no one else of any \textbf{age} has.

Wait until you get here--if you're someone who keeps growing, you'll feel way younger than you thought you would.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I like this video, I like how people of different ages connect, it's beautiful. I don't like how the word \textbf{old} is portrayed as a bad thing. I would imagine when some uses the word \textbf{old} to describe an object then that's means it outdated and needs to be replaced. But I think when it comes to people \textbf{old} means your gown up, hair color changes, body changes, it what happens. I can be be \textbf{old} because I'm no longer young. It's worse for me when you can't use a word to describe someone \textbf{age}, it's more of an insult to me. "This person is young while this other person, is not as young as they used to be." Hearing something like that feels like in insult, it still says "\textbf{old}" but in a socially conditioned respectful way, which really is just condescending to me. Over wording it and beating around the bush feels bad to me. I'm writing this because of \textbf{old} can't be used to describe a person then there needs to be new word. I can be young, I can be middle aged, I can be \textbf{old}, I can be really \textbf{old}.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}9/195 & \cellcolor{green!5}4.615 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Actually this video ad is extremely offensive and delivers the wrong message. It suggests that "\textbf{old}" is a negative quality. The millennials revised their definition of "\textbf{old}" upward, but there are ninety-year-olds running marathons. In the first part they're asked to show some behaviors by "\textbf{old}" people; their responses seem to be mocking the older people.  Since when does the ability to do pushups, burpees and jumping jacks relate to one's ability to function in strong roles in society and it's hardly a basis for job discrimination. Quite a few millennials can't do them either. What does "\textbf{old}" mean to these people? Or more important, what does "\textbf{old}" mean to a hiring manager? Some commenters suggest that "\textbf{age} is just a number," but this video makes the opposite point. It says "\textbf{old}" is bad, but there's disagreement about where the "\textbf{old}" begins.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}8/142 & \cellcolor{green!27}5.634 \\  \hline

Many of her friends are 80 plus and act this way. I have friends who are 60 and "\textbf{old}." Go easy on the millennials if you can. Some are just responding to what they see out there.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I don't blame millennials for believing anything over 35 is \textbf{old}.  After all, when you're so young time tends to move slowly; you're always waiting for a time when you're in control of your own life... and it seems to take f..o..r..e..v..e..r.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I don't blame the younger people in this video for their opinion on \textbf{age}. It is our society - more specifically the way advertisers promote products and services to younger people and forget everyone else. Once you enter your 30's you are forgotten about. Technology is also the problem and how it is marketed, do you see older people in a smart phone commercial? No, everyone is in their 20's or even younger. I never really cared about \textbf{age}, it is definitely how you feel and one thing I have noticed is that I have never stopped learning.
