  \cellcolor{green!5}\small You totally misunderstood me. I did NOT say that men LOOK more attractive at 40. I said they BECOME more attractive. Attraction is not a beauty-centric term only (at least, that's not how I used it). I'm not naive enough to think that men start looking like Brad Pitt as they \textbf{age}. Of course they get grey, wrinkley and \textbf{old} just like women -- and arguably worse.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Umm, I don't know a single man in real life or "Hollywood" that has gotten more attractive as he got older. Seriously, not one. Some \textbf{age} better than others, but pretty much everyone looks better at 25 than they do at 45. Younger women go for older men for their biological impulses also. Just as men seek youth\&beauty, women seek security. And even an older man w/a crappy job, car\&house can look like he has more to offer financially than her peers.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I am so terrible I was slightly depressed when I turned 19, but as I see it every year is closer to death and there is not enough time. Don't hate me.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Nothing wrong with getting \textbf{old} at all. Now that being said this story is such b.s.This women acts way too confident to over compensate. I dated a cougar who was smoking hot but god was she a \textbf{mental} wreck confidence wise. Especially if they're still single and have no kids.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small "people go demented with \textbf{age} too."Given that your initial stance was "\textbf{Ageing} is a bad thing", all the negatives would be included in that statement (which didn't need to be addressed).

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Wrong. It's been proven that conservatives are more sexually aroused by \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} erotica. Look up 'latent homosexuality' on wikipedia.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small What Wes says at the end is true. All the really smokin' hot and popular girls from my high school (graduated 1991) are ugly. A lot of them got \textbf{fat}.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Oh stop it. It's not like a bunch of marketing people decided that being \textbf{old} sucks. They're simply adapting their messages to what we already believe. And what we believe is instinctual. Women's drop in fertility coincides with how attractive men find them. That's why it's so classic for men to ditch their wives around 40 and go after a younger girl. Ironically, men become more attractive as they get older. This is nature. Yeah, it sucks. But marketers didn't invent it. Get real, idiots.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}1/85 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.176 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small you are misunderstanding gaining knowledge and wisdom with the actual process of \textbf{ageing}.If \textbf{ageing} could be eliminated scientifically you would gain the same wisdom and experience without \textbf{ageing}. \textbf{Ageing} does not cause you to be wise. Besides getting wiser with \textbf{age} and deserving more respect just for being \textbf{old} is not always true or applicable, people go demented with \textbf{age} too.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Ageing, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}6/61 & \cellcolor{green!5}9.836 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Betty White sure has loosened up comedy wise over the years. I remember seeing Stuttering John ask her in an early '90s Stern clip if you fart in your house do you blame it on the dog? She took offense and walked away lol.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I wish they had actually discussed this topic instead of letting Ana read the quotes and then Cenk brings it back to his experience.  Hello!  Are you a \textbf{chick}?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small So, she's basically complaining about \textbf{ageism} while being \textbf{ageist} agaisnt younger women?

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small A woman's libido peaks in her 30s so it's not surprising a lot of men find them hot. I'm 60 this year and I am happy to say my libido has died a painless, natural death. I know my body shows its \textbf{age} but I am proud of my *life*, my living of it, and this \textbf{ageing} is part of that.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I am not buying it. What next? They are talking about \textbf{ageing} in mostly physical sense , whats next? people being proud of their brain tumors? This is just tapping into the insecurity of the mid -life crisis people, who would then want to be like her, probably want to read her books in future etc. \textbf{Ageing} is a bad thing, we all know it to the core, being comfortable is with it is different than being proud of it.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Ageing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/80 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.5 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Listen, the world has long changed and America is not a place where women can afford to NOT work.  Its just not feasible if you're single or your husband does not bring in enough to support a family.  Thats just the way it is so get use to it. And as a married \textbf{woman} I can say feeling "taken care of" is about much more than just money.  It involves emotional support, a sense of teamwork and commitment on both sides.  It's not your illness thats to blame for being you single, its your attitude.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/95 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.053 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small It all comes down to targeted marketing. Beauty suppliers want women to feel bad about growing older. And they target young women in their twenties and early thirties as well. There's a huge market for making people feel bad about themselves so you can sell them a miracle cure. But I think some of you are missing her point entirely. Women in their thirties are usually more confident because they are more focused on other things other than just being attractive to the opposite \textbf{sex}.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Sex & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/85 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.176 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I am basing it off of personal experience (for myself and others).Most of my relationships have been with older women, but try this:Go into an internet chatroom as, say, 20 year \textbf{old} male and try to talk to women.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Maybe we should recognise \textbf{old} women say above 48 are useless (I've heard they dry up). They should be put down.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small When society imposes a stigma on something, such as \textbf{age}, people who are afflicted by that stigma fight it by being proud of the thing stigmatized, rather then ashamed of it or cowered by the stigma.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small You're right, Leaving wife \& kids for an 18 year \textbf{old} is morally wrong but did you know there's a good reason why males are attracted to younger females? Scientists believe men are subconsciously attracted to younger healthier women with an hour glass shaped body because women with those attributes produce superior offsprings. Studies show women are more fertile \& capable of having healthier pregnancy between the ages of 18-25. Fertility issues \& miscarriages have an increased risk as women \textbf{age}.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}2/81 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.469 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Exactly. Look at Robert Downey Jr. for example. He is 47 years of \textbf{age} and is considered very attractive.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small So true, the media keeps trying to sell the idea that younger women want older guys. It pisses me off because I have to deal with these men that are \textbf{old} enough to be father because it.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Women have it in their best interest to lie about their \textbf{age} after their mid 20s because their worth is ultimately determined by baby potential, and baby potential declines with \textbf{age}, especially in the 30s.
