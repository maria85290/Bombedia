It's is worse then everyone is being told. Sad, half of all Americans and half of all Israelis are bringing pulled down into the bloody mud by these vicious rats.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Vatsala काली Jhaveri But how close was India to attacking Kahuta in the 1980s? The first time India is believed to have considered such an attack is in 1981. The idea obviously originated from the daring Israeli attack of June 7, 1981, that destroyed the under-construction Iraqi nuclear reactor at Osirak. Eight F-16s of the Israeli Air Force flew more than 600 miles in the skies of three enemy nations to destroy the target and returned unscathed.In their book, Deception: Pakistan, the United States and the Global Nuclear Conspiracy, Adrian Levy and Catherine Scott-Clark claim that \textbf{Indian} military officials secretly travelled to Israel in February 1983 to buy electronic warfare equipment to neutralise Kahuta's air defences. Israel reportedly also provided India with technical details of the F-16 aircraft in exchange for Indians providing them some details about the MiG-23 aircraft. In mid- to late-1983, according to strategic affairs expert Bharat Karnad, Indira Gandhi asked the IAF once again to plan for an air strike on Kahuta.The mission was cancelled after Pakistani nuclear scientist Munir Ahmed Khan met \textbf{Indian} Atomic Energy Commission chief-designate Raja Ramanna at an international meet in Vienna and threatened a retaliatory strike on Bhabha Atomic Research Centre at Trombay.The next time India is believed to have seriously considered attacking Kahuta was in September-October 1984. Details of the Pakistani nuclear programme crossing the weaponisation enrichment threshold had then begun to emerge. As seen from documents declassified last week, on September 16, 1984, US Ambassador Dean Hinton told Zia that if the US were to see signs that India was preparing for an attack, they would notify Pakistan immediately.It has also been rumoured that Israeli air force was part of the plans to attack Kahuta in 1984 because it did not want to see an 'Islamic Bomb' developed by Pakistan. Israel was supposed to lead this attack and not merely play the role of advising the IAF. Bharat Karnad has written that Israeli aircraft were to be staged from Jamnagar airfield in Gujarat, refuel at a satellite airfield in North India and track the Himalayas to avoid early radar detection, but Indira Gandhi eventually vetoed the idea. Levy and Scott-Clark though claim that Indira Gandhi had signed off on the Israeli-led operation in March 1984 but backed off after the US state department warned India 'the US will be responsive if India persists'.

Hamas just sends these rockets in huge amounts and there comes a time when they just have to wipe out all of the terrorists and their weapons.If Israel wanted to wipe out Palestinians they would do it in 1 day, if there was actually "\textbf{ethnic} cleansing" going on as you anti-Israelis call it, their population wouldn't increase as much as it did and does till today. That being said, Palestinians are a bunch of Arabs from different countries,  the area of modern "Palestine" was considered southern Syria, there was actually no national identity of "Palestine" nor Palestinians", these are made up terms to fight Israel politically, physically as well.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnic & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/213 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.469 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Let me just say this, I am Canadian with Palestinian blood.. But I have a Canadian passport, so basically there is a good side of Israel and a bad side. I met over a hundred of Israeli people and most of them are very nice, we can't just blame all Israel for this war that's happening, half of them are nice and the other half are really bad, they're bad for a reason... because they started bombing Palestine a few centuries ago, they won't ever give up and it's so obvious like till now it's still happening and they never give up on taking over Palestine.. So some Palestinians try protecting themselves by threatening Israel.. Others by deserting to other countries, the point I'm trying to make here is that Palestinians can't just keep swearing at Israel, and Israel can't just keep bombing and killing children in Palestine! What's left for Palestinians? What's left for them? Israel have over a million of companies around the world and Palestinians... They have \textbf{nothing}! And if they have.. They'd barely have some, Israel is rich! They're all okay with their lives! But Palestinians... Most of them don't have passports! They can't travel! They don't work! They don't have money! So if we can just fix a problem here, we can do it by convincing Israel to stop bombing children in Palestine (not in Gaza but specifically Palestine!) like okay we get that u want the country but where's the logic? Let's just say they take over the country after its all destroyed! What's going to be left over! We didn't live to destroy people's lives! We didn't live to make wars! We didn't live to keep blaming Palestinians and Israeli people for our mistakes! Think of things before you take action! We want peace and that's all... Killing won't help! It would simply make it worse!!

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Both sides need to let go, forgive, but it will never occur. The violence is a cycle, of continuous, non-stop hatred. Israel is much more guiltier than the Palestinians who are no angels either, but no 'devil(s)/demon(s). They are both humans, both believe they are right, and deserve this land more, all on insane claims to the lands all based on Holiness, from their 'Holy' Books, in their ' Holy' land, of their 'Holy' Prophets, in a 'Holy' time many Millenniums ago. Israel will never allow them to have true peace, and let's be honest. They are the true aggressor, opposed to who's defending themselves, the Palestinians. Who went from 100 percent of the land, to 60/40, and then in 1967 to present day to where it gets worse where they are segregated as South Africa, or US in the 1900's and back. Palestinians are treated as foreigners on a land their ancestors lived in for centuries, millennium and a half or so.The Jewish people were exiled from Israel/Palestine and thus were taught not to return to Israel until their Prophet returned. Who returned? Who is their Prophet that is back? I don't see him, other's do not, and will never see him, because there is no such thing. The recent conflict in Gaza, all you need to do is look at the death tolls, and who is dying. Israeli soldiers, compared to innocent Palestinian civilians such as women, children, \textbf{elderly} people, men, and soldiers (where Palestinians have a small army, compared to Israel they stand no chance. Weaponry such as democratically elected Hamas uses is \textbf{nothing} to that of the Israelis, so let's be realistic here. The Palestinian ones are afraid of a \textbf{terrorist} state, acting out terrorism on them, and are defending themselves, not causing the problems intentionally for no purpose besides terrorism. Not true, there is always a purpose and reasoning to every action, and two sides to every story.  Palestinians are not terrorists as many would love to claim, mostly Zionists, crypto-Jews (non-Semitic, yet call other's anti-Semites. Even if they were, what does that have to do with you? Hah! A joke.Ignorant people unfortunately fall for this crap), and innocents are victimized by the 'victims' physically and mentally. Also, all throughout the world, the US is hated because of it's policing of the world, and it will come back to bite them in the ass. Support for Israel will be the second one, as many Arabs stated they wouldn't hate America if they didn't support Israel killing Arabs, slaughtering them, in almost genocidal ways. Israel has how many Nukes? Yet won't admit that they do, and sign the treaty that every other Nuclear power has.They hide behind victimhood, and the Holocaust, yet Holodomor the Ukrainian Genocide done by the USSR by Stalin, and Pol Pot in Cambodia, or Armenians by the Turkish, yet the Holocaust is covered every week or sooner, and Museums are everywhere. Where are the Museums everywhere for the other genocides? Not in the US for sure.

It got bad when half the land was taken over. The Arabs tried to get there land back in a peaceful way like the native Americans in Massachusetts did, when they did not comply, like the native Americans, they wanted to fight back, but at that time it was too late, they had most of the Arab weapons and like the colony that Americans feel bad for taking over, Palestine gets taken over in 1948.

[LINK] It's true that he does claim at some point that: "The Near Eastern–Caucasus ancestries are dominant among Central (38) and Eastern (32) European Jews followed by Western European ancestry (30)"; And also that: "Although the Rhineland hypothesis explains the Middle Eastern ancestry by stating that Jews migrated from Palestine to Europe in the 7th century, it fails to explain the large Caucasus ancestry, which is nearly endemic to Caucasus populations"... However, a quick look at his Fig 5 reviles that other Middle Eastern populations, like the Cypriots, Syrians and the Lebanese, got almost the same amount of "Caucasus ancestry" (~15 - 25) and a much-much higher amount of "Near-Eastern ancestry" (that would probably be Turkic ancestry - which would make them closer to Khazars than the Ashkenazi Jews), and even some amount of "Western European ancestry" (10-20) - which altogether means that Askenazi Jews got most of their "Caucasus ancestry" and a bit of their "Western European ancestry" in their ancient homeland in the Middle East...Here you can see it all, in his Fig 5: [LINK] Now, the thing I like most about Eran Elhaik's study is the part were he tries to determine the "biogeographical origin coordinates" (i.e. where in the world thy most fit genetically today) of Eastern European and Central European Ashkenazi Jews by comparing their DNA to DNA of other populations who live today in different places of the world... To make a long story short, he comes up with all kinds of coordinates in the northern parts of the Middle East - not even close to Europe... For example: The smallest deviations in the geographical coordinates were obtained with Armenians for both Eastern (38 ± 2.7° N, 39.9 ± 0.4° E) and Central (35 ± 5° N, 39.7 ± 1.1° E) European Jews... Now try running those coordinates on Google Maps, and you'll find that the biogeographical centers of Eatern (38° N, 39.9° E) and Central (35° N, 39.7° E) European Jews, are just a bit to the north and a bit to the south of the line between Ur-Kashdim and Harran - which are mentioned in the Bible as the original homeland of Abraham: [LINK] Funny, isn't it?\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Transition & \cellcolor{green!5}Sexual Identity - Transexuality & \cellcolor{green!5}1/518 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.193 \\  \hline

You claim to have studied history so you should know this then."I DID STUDY HISTORY, and I do know why indians have issues with islam, but there are a lot that hate muslims. period."You just reinforced my point.

You can call me anti-Islamic, go right ahead, it's a very fitting term to use - it's ACCURATE - Islamophobia however is just insultingly inaccurate, it makes it sound like anti-Islamic people have \textbf{mental} disorders. If your counter-argument to someone's criticism is that they are just mentally defective, you don't really have a counter-argument at all, you have an insult, and insults do not refute another person's claims, it only makes it seem like you have no real arguments to make.STOP using the term. It does you no favors."Judging by your rhetoric, you're obviously anti-islamic and quite frankly I don't have time to discuss things, when you HYPOCRITE, have come here to defame the premises of my argument."I am hypocritical now? how?Yes, I am anti-Islamic. And yes, I have obviously come here to counter your argument about Islam. You are basically arguing that the non-Islamic people are the ones' making things bad, not the ideology they oppose, and that they "should join the rest of us in the 21st century" - this is funny to me because non-Islamic people do live in the 21st century, where Atheism is rife due to the overwhelming evidence to explain things that was previously the domain of religions, and even other religions adapt to reflect the time we live in.Except Islam. Islam refuses to adapt and evolve and insists on rules regualtions and ideals that were created over a thousand four hundred years ago - ergo it creates many problems, and anti-Islamic people don't like that - so they object.I am here the defame the premise of your arguments.

When Socialism first came out it resulted in them starting wars, massacring people just to overthrow anything that they did not agree with. Today Socialist governments are one of the most corrupt out there. As I have said in Israel, the Socialist government discriminated against Middle Eastern Jews, their culture and took away certain rights. They also took the rights from the religious, took many Hasidic children and Religious Yemenite Jewish children, put them in homes to Secularize them...this was DONE by the Socialist government of Israel and everyone knows this very well. Today at least the Conservative gives rights to Jews of all background, color, religious sects, non-religious peoples while the Socialist focused on forcefully secularizing the entire \textbf{nation}.

Thatcher and other Conservative governments gave wealth and good economy to Britain but it came out of other countries pockets.
