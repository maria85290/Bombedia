  \cellcolor{green!5}\small That was a ratings farce. She didn't use A SINGLE LIFETIME LOCAL! My papa was born right after \textbf{black} folks were run out. It was a sad day when it happened. Few \textbf{black} young men were accused of raping and later brutally killing a white girl. White folks in the county wasn't even going to RISK something like that happening again. Also, many of the churches in the area preached separation of the races when it came to marriage and they were afraid if \textbf{black} folks moved in, there would be more temptations and intermingling. They got their understanding from the scripture where God separated the people as justification.But it was all one sided. \textbf{Nobody} cared that a white person couldn't move to the Bankhead Hwy area that was ALL \textbf{BLACK} as well as any of the other hoods. She wasn't in any danger. It added to the SENSATIONALISM. The brave \textbf{black} \textbf{woman} barreling into a Lions den of white racists that would kill her had they half a chance.If Hosea Williams NEVER MARCHED ON FORSYTH it wouldn't have been but a few more years and it would have happened organically.

In a later interview with BBC Television, Judge Ward stated, "Alex Haley perpetrated a hoax on the public." - WikiAnd so have you, Oprah Winfrey. A dangerous one at that. Charles, Prince of Wales, and Buckingham Palace should sue you for everything you have. A vast network of \textbf{Black} cons including Panthers who admitted they're fascists in training courtesy of a tyrant in Mexico, and who have used/visited United Methodist Outreach Ministries' (UMOM) facilities/programs, have been systematically holocausting the British in the US and Britain "one by one", because according to said Blacks, the British are all White Racists/Supremacists since they settled/established Britain/the US, and therefore, "have/own more of everything than the Blacks", and because "everyone likes (the British)". The greatest offender, according to said Blacks, was Princess Diana because her beauty (both inside and out) and caring for the peoples drew tremendous media attention to the great good Charles and the palace do for the needy, making the British more popular than ever. Thus, said Blacks claim they "needed" to "put an end to that". They said they accidentally discovered that "it was easy" to get away with having caused nervous breakdowns and fatal accidents so they learned to orchestrate these. British at UMOM said they contacted you about the hideous/illegal things said/done to them by said Blacks, whereupon, not only were matters  immediately worse for the British but said Blacks remarked you not only supported but encouraged them to keep doing what they do, and at a later time they said that they considered your own attitude/remarks re Priness Diana "approval" to "put an end that". Said Blacks assert that to allege/accuse a \textbf{Black} of committing even a misdemeanor is racism/supremacy, and they're working on making this a felony for the allegers/accusers. Supremacy comes from the Latinword supremus, which means highest.supremacy: the quality or state of being supremealso : supreme authority or powerPut the word "white" in front of it, however, and according to said Blacks this is the "new terrorism", and an "epidemic", that "needs to be wiped out". Even though the majority of British holocausted are no threat to anyone, while a portion of said Blacks have been convicted of hate crimes, (true or not) they bragged that they "don't allow" dictionaries to use "\textbf{Black} Supremacist" as an example. Said Blacks are identical to you, at least in that, every "no" uttered to a \textbf{Black} is evidence of racism/supremacy when whining publicly. Behind closed doors, however, they boast that this is how they make everyone their "dogs". And get freebies for compensation which they immediately publicly display akin to trophies.

But policies brought on by Democracts (the same that brought you \textbf{Jim C\textbf{row}} laws) killed the growth, killed the jobs and instead presented welfare as a lifestyle in those neighborhoods. People don't add it up... White Democrats injected their policies and power in those neighborhoods to use those citizens as votes.

And as for your argument about fighting for blacks is only because we are here if the majority had it their way everything \textbf{black} would be dead or just some where's else. Why with all that has been done over let's say just the past 20 years are \textbf{black} men and women still killed by police,  when they are posing no threat? Why are \textbf{black} and brown people the highest incarcerated? Why are they continue to be discriminated against for just sitting in a coffee shop?

Sadly you prove the point by not acknowledging some of the problems that we as \textbf{black} people face on a daily basis as I said before even to this day the \textbf{racism} that still exist really makes no sense at all. Yes you are correct when you say that everyone hold some type of \textbf{racism} within their hearts but when it pours out into action that's where the problem really arises and yes it happens to everyone but more so to \textbf{African} Americans by all other races all over the world sadly enough\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African, Black, Racism & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}4/113 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.54 \\  \hline

Look Paul you mentioned you were in Iraq so you are a fairly young man.  the world is a much different place than when your father was your \textbf{age}.  and that's why its so much more of a problem today.  with all our advances as the human \textbf{race},  we as one \textbf{race} continue to suffer unexplainable bigotry.

You don't need to apologize at all, I am simply stating my opinion, we both may have some untrue statements but the main point remains the same. We see many advancements with technology but humans are basically the same as they were 1,000 years ago, except there are now so many more people. The only option is to live life the best we can and protect the things that are most important to us. The system is stacked against everyone and until this generation is out of power I don't see any improvements happening in the next 20 years. Our only hope is to teach the younger generation who are entering these positions now to respect their fellow man regardless of their \textbf{race} or economic status because it is truly sad the state of affairs when you find yourself in the court system. It would be nice if we had leaders who cared about fixing the system but clearly everyone in power is more worried about enriching themselves.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Aniyah Hart Honey, this idea that you can't be \textbf{racist} toward white people is so ridiculous. Have you taken a moment to see what the definition of \textbf{racism} is? Some of the most \textbf{racist} people I have met were \textbf{black} and asian, when I was in the military I got to meet some of the greatest friends I will ever have the pleasure of meeting and working with. Along the way, you also get to experience just how \textbf{racist} people of every color are toward each other. There does not need to be any systematic oppression for someone to treat a group of people different due to the color of their skin. "prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different \textbf{race} based on the belief that one's own \textbf{race} is superior." These college classes that would try and add something to this definition are promoting \textbf{racism} themselves. So your point is that it's fine to hate on white people because some people in the past were systematically oppressed. You weren't oppressed of course, but if you want to be \textbf{racist} and hate on the white people that is fine. What is your definition of \textbf{black} people hating white people as a group due to the color of their skin? I really want to know what you are going to explain \textbf{racism} toward white by blacks as anything other than the \textbf{racism} that it is.Or what do you call the white people being murdered by \textbf{black} people in South Africa due to the color of their skin? Is that justice instead of \textbf{racism}?

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Arya Deva \textbf{Race} isn't 'appearance'. And you cannot have a successful society consisting of multiple races. We have evolved in different areas apart for thousands of years, there are differences in survival strategies, mating strategies, cultures, intelligence, religion, etc. The balkans is a perfect example of what happens when you force people who are different together. If you cannot see that what we have now is 'anti white' not 'egalitarian' than you are \textbf{blind}. White nations are all being flooded with nonwhites through organizations, that is how men in subsaharan \textbf{African} are getting all the way into places like England or Iceland, or Germany. It's a funded invasion. By putting one group of people on another group of people's land you are working against them, look what happened to the native Americans. Was that 'good diversity'? Our nations have become whores to the internationalists and the very concept of '\textbf{nation}' means \textbf{ethnicity}. That is how my people (the Polish people) have stayed together despite not having a \textbf{nation} state for 123 years and losing sovereignty multiple times. It is why we stayed together as a people rather than just integrating into the nations who ruled over us at the time. It is because we are not 'people who happen to live in Poland' we are POLISH people.

THANK THE WHITE MAN WHO INVENTED THOSE MEANS OF ENTERTAINMENT.  You have probably flown on a plane/commercial airliner etc.  THANK THE WHITE MAN WHO INVENTED AIR PLANES. The list goes on my friend.  Yes the populations of China and India very large but they don't hate white people. White people helped those countries get on their feet. Over all that is. So don't get any kind of idea that you're going to declare war on white people. Because white people are at the forefront of all science and technology.  Now if they can invent all what I have mentioned, think of all the deadly weapons they could come up with (not to mention the ones they already have locked up in the volt just waiting to come out the wood if that day comes) So you just might wanna give that some thought also my friend, because you are no match for the white man in war.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Race & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/297 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.337 \\  \hline

First a single \textbf{black}, professional mother gets a place in a predominantly white neighborhood with the best intentions. She's doing a good job with her kid. However, a relative of her claims to be needy and pretty much forces his way in on her. Maybe he just got out of prison. That is a \textbf{common} problem in \textbf{black} neighborhoods, where single \textbf{black} women are seen as marks, and others in her family feel entitled to her help whether they deserve it, or earned it, or not. And this relative who pushes his way in soon has his entire "crew" in and around her house. So his crime buddies are making trouble in other neighborhoods and then hanging out there. So what happens? Some of the nearby white homes, along with that one, all get sprayed with bullets. And a couple of the most stable white families move out for the safety of their kids. Then their houses sit empty for a while, and may face blacks from that first home hanging out there and trashing the vacant lots. Then when the realtors get involved, about all they can get are \textbf{black} folks. Then more conflict arises, there is more white flight, etc.You can watch various Youtube videos on this sort of thing. Watch HUD videos, or even the episode of The Super with David Paladino who faced this. He got calls from neighbors of a \textbf{black} lady to complain about bullet holes in their homes. Some of these neighbors were \textbf{black} too, and they didn't want their toddlers and primary school children dodging bullets. He first told her to keep her brother and his company away, since they were all gangsters and starting beef with another gang who would keep showing up for payback.

The facts are facts unfortunately and there were a number of areas that grew more popular to \textbf{black} people that unfortunately then became trashed and unruly.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Autumn Rainwater I'm not trying to be condecending in any way but have you ever taken an anthropology course in college? All your questions would have been answered. I don't think you are \textbf{racist} but maybe a bit misinformed. 1. You cannot fairly compare \textbf{black} crime vs white crime anymore. It's very much oranges-to-apples to do so. This is due to ghettos, the large number of \textbf{black} children born out of wedlock, and the systemic \textbf{racism} that exists within the U.S. that prevents blacks from getting the necessary education and training needed to progress in life and live their American dream (yes, \textbf{racism} is still a thing no matter how badly you want to say it's gone). The school systems established in \textbf{black} neighborhoods is horrendous. \textbf{Black} children are forced to learn with outdated books, untrained teachers, archaic technology, and weak counseling. Most non-white children don't have to deal with this and so they move on through life regularly. But blacks are left with three options, compete with white children to get into colleges they will never be accepted to, leave their homes (where they probably have a lot ancestral history), or commit crime to put food on the table. And you can guess which one they pick the most. This leads directly to my next point, which is that an overwhelming number of \textbf{black} children are born without fathers. The National Center for Health Statistics said in 2015 that 77.3 of \textbf{black} children live in single-mother homes due to the mass-incarceration of \textbf{black} males. Since single mother homes have the highest probably of creating criminals, this worsens the issue even more. This is especially interesting because \textbf{black} families used to be one of the strongest families in America before the Vietnam War. Children born out of wedlock used to be highest among whites and lowest among blacks. But as soon as soldiers brought back drugs from Vietnam, the ghettos became consumed in crime. Why did this happen? The systemic \textbf{racism} I talked about before. \textbf{Black} vets could not get jobs and had much tougher experiences doing the same thing their fellow white vets were doing so they turned to selling drugs to earn money for their families. This created the modern ghettos. If there is anything I have learned in life, and that is desperation will make a man/\textbf{woman} do anything. And before I forget, here are 10 of the most successful \textbf{black} areas in the U.S. ( [LINK]  You could have just done a quick Google search and found this. This proves that not ALL \textbf{black} communities are like what you describe. 2. You are making outright false claims there bud. First, Serial killers span all racial and \textbf{ethnic} groups in the U.S. The racial diversity of serial killers generally mirrors that of the overall U.S. population (yes, this also means there are more white serial than \textbf{black} ones). Second, of the 153 mass shooting cases recorded, none had ended in the conviction of a \textbf{black} man, \textbf{woman}, or undocumented \textbf{immigrant} by July 2018. And even in previous years, white males were over-represented in school shootings.3. Independent \textbf{black} countries don't exist today because during de-colonization, the European powers took a lot of the wealth they produced in Africa with them. That means the golds, the metals, the natural resources, etc. They also had set up several governments when they were there. So when they left, there were huge vacancies of power and without any of the training and education, Africans had no idea how to fix the many problems they were left with. As we know from history, vacancies of power with no organized governmental systems lead to catastrophe. Colonization very much destroyed Afirca.

The Yakuza, Bloods, Latin Kings, Mafia, Al Queda, KKK/Skinheads, etc... They are all born from poor neighborhoods and low class status. Drive around the U.S. and youll see "ghettos" of every \textbf{race}, they just go by different names like trailer parks or slums. And in these undesirable areas is where crime takes place; crimes from every single \textbf{race}. My mom lives in a 3 story house and shes never done a drive-by or sold heroine.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I just watched a video where they asked a \textbf{blind} man about \textbf{race}. He was white, and he said something that we all should understand. We should judge an individual by his character and what he or she does. Not what they look like, which is what we tend to do. These white people in the panel have the right to feel how they feel, but it doesn't make their feelings correct. They just feared change, and due to the lack of understanding of \textbf{black} culture they were disgusted and afraid of something different entering the life they were use to and changing it. To be prejudice is simply unacceptable, because you are implying that one \textbf{race} is better then the other. Yet it is obvious that all cultures of different skin colors contributed and still contributes to humanity and its advancement in all kinds of ways. This negativity is all just something taught to us to keep us from being unified.

The white \textbf{race} is dying and it's intentional. I'll give you an example. Norway has always been a white country but now they are complaining that it is too white.

Since 2000, the imprisonment rate among African-American women has dropped 47 percent, while the rate among  white women has risen by 56 percent. These trends have combined to shrink the racial disparity in women's imprisonment by two-thirds.A similar pattern emerges for men, who compose a much larger share of the prison population. The rate of imprisonment among African-American men remains very high, a quarter of which is based on wrongful imprisonment, nonetheless it has tumbled 22 percent since 2000. The rate for white men in contrast is 4 percent higher than it was in 2000. As a result, the racial disparity has shrunk by nearly one quarter.Here's the link to that article:  [LINK] In any rate, 40 of 2,200,000 is 880,000, NOT 1,000,000 lol. 47 of 880,000 is 413,600.

They believed that everyone had the right to live on it.Anthropologists have discovered that what we now know as the Native American is not as native as we fully think-- there was another \textbf{race} of humans that lived in the Americas, eventually being driven out by the 'Native Americans' who migrated from east asia on land bridges of the far east of Russia which had been present in the last ice \textbf{age}. And if you want to get technical here-- Whites have been driven out of places that we consider 'ours' for centuries from many foundations of people including the Huns, Mongols, Arabs, and Africans. In fact, just less than a century or two before Spanish colonization had occured in the Americas, the Spanish have been fighting wars against the Muslim caliphates to RETAKE Spain itself.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Thank you  everyone! These days if you have an issue with anyone of a different \textbf{race} it's immediately labeled \textbf{racism} without even knowing what the issue that started it is all about. I was called a \textbf{racist} when I got into it with an older white man at Walmart. I was walking through entrance door holding my daughter's hand when this speeding cart was exiting the entrance door. It happened so fast and the cart ran over my daughter honestly I didn't think of how or why at that moment because my focus was Heaven. The cart was full and heavy so a group of people lifted it so I could pull her from underneath of course she was screaming mostly because it scared her. She had a few scrapes but \textbf{nothing} major and I wasn't upset because accidents happen then that man said maybe you should watch her better from now on. I lost it and I told him off without cursing or being physical although the other customers wanted to tear him up. I wasn't being \textbf{racist} I was being a mother heck if another \textbf{black} person would've said that i would've reacted the same way. I didn't ask for or expect an apology but when responded the way he did sent me into orbit because it became clear that he didn't care and she could've been really hurt. If only I had known that God was about to dispatch angels to bring Heaven \& my husband home to be with him I wouldn've spent one second arguing with that man. I'm remarried now and we recently lost our two children. We are 35 \& 37 death swept through our lives taking our family with it and it's hard but God left us here for a reason. Life, children and family is a blessing and in a blink it could all gone so spend time enjoying your blessings and being thankful for them. Don't waste time on the nonsense going on just lead by example! Action speaks louder than words ever could and everything contagious isn't always bad. Since my children died I've started my own anti-bullying underground campaign because when a parent loses a child it's a nightmare and too many parents are losing their children to bullies. I didn't have options when my girls died from illness but we can do something about losing our children to bullies.

His door was jammed so he had to climb out of the broken window and we helped so I asked him if he was ok but he didn't say anything at first then he yelled all we needed to discuss was my insurance to pay for his car. I said we just wanna help u and he said I'm calling the cops so u best get your insurance papers. I said sir we didn't hit u it was someone in the SUV. When the SUV guy got out he asked the man was he ok and said he had full coverage insurance then that man said it's ok, don't worry about that right now I'm just glad you're ok. He didn't care we came to help him in a storm after just leaving the salon all he saw was \textbf{black} women. He didn't even say thank u or anything he put his arm around the boy and walked off. When I was in a wreck before I didn't care about the \textbf{race} of the help, I was grateful for them helping me. A few weeks later I did everything to track that person down to send them a gift.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small At first these white people breathed a sigh of relief. At last, they said, "No more crime, drugs, violence and welfare. All of the blacks have gone!" Then suddenly, reality set in. The "NEW AMERICA" is not America at all — only a barren land. 1. There are very few crops that have flourished because the \textbf{nation} was built on a slave-supported system. 2. There are no cities with tall skyscrapers because Alexander Mils, a \textbf{black} man, invented the elevator, and without it, one finds great difficulty reaching higher floors. 3. There are few if any cars because Richard Spikes, a \textbf{black} man, invented the automatic gearshift, Joseph Gambol, also \textbf{black}, invented the Super Charge System for Internal Combustion Engines, and Garrett A. Morgan, a \textbf{black} man, invented the traffic signals. 4. Furthermore, one could not use the rapid transit system because its procurer was the electric trolley, which was invented by another \textbf{black} man, Albert R. Robinson. 5. Even if there were streets on which cars and a rapid transit system could operate, they were cluttered with paper because an \textbf{African} American, Charles Brooks, invented the street sweeper. 6. There were few if any newspapers, magazines and books because John Love invented the pencil sharpener, William Purveys invented the fountain pen, and Lee Barrage invented the Type Writing Machine and W. A. Love invented the Advanced Printing Press. They were all, you guessed it, \textbf{Black}. 7. Even if Americans could write their letters, articles and books, they would not have been transported by mail because William Barry invented the Postmarking and Canceling Machine, William Purveys invented the Hand Stamp and Philip Downing invented the Letter Drop. 8. The lawns were brown and wilted because Joseph Smith invented the Lawn Sprinkler and John Burr the Lawn Mower. 9. When they entered their homes, they found them to be poorly ventilated and poorly heated. You see, Frederick Jones invented the Air Conditioner and Alice Parker the Heating Furnace. Their homes were also \textbf{dim}. But of course, Lewis Later invented the Electric Lamp, Michael Harvey invented the lantern and Granville T. Woods invented the Automatic Cut off Switch. Their homes were also filthy because Thomas W. Steward invented the Mop and Lloyd P. Ray the Dust Pan. 10. Their children met them at the door-barefooted, shabby, motley and unkempt. But what could one expect? Jan E. Matzelinger invented the Shoe Lasting Machine, Walter Sammons invented the Comb, Sarah Boone invented the Ironing Board and George T. Samon invented the Clothes Dryer. 11. Finally, they were resigned to at least have dinner amidst all of this turmoil. But here again, the food had spoiled because another \textbf{Black} Man, John Standard invented the refrigerator. Now, isn't that something? What would this country be like without the contributions of Blacks, as \textbf{African}-Americans? Martin Luther King, Jr. said, "by the time we leave for work, Americans have depended on the inventions from the minds of Blacks." \textbf{Black} history includes more than just slavery, Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X, and Marcus Garvey and W.E.B.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I lived down there (Atlanta) during that time and, as I recall things, Oprah did not choose to leave town before dark, she was run out of town, and made it out safely with the assistance of the National Guard.  Unless you experienced it for yourself, it's difficult to understand what it is really like. Or, I should say was like, anyway, as I moved in the late eighties. Regardless of how you might feel about it, there are (or were) many parts of the south that remained unchanged for many, many decades. Oprah was ill-advised to go there at that time, and was doing little more than poking at a hornets nest with a stick. She was in search of ratings, not attempting to improve \textbf{race} relations. Did her visit change anything there? I could be wrong, but I don't I don't recall anything positive resulting from her visit, and would be really shocked if the county now celebrates Oprah Winfrey Day. Not having lived there for almost 30 years now, I don't know if it would be any different today, but back then, she did little more that endanger the well being of those who accompanied her that day.

Now I'm not advocating we have forced segregation again. The though of that idea wouldn't work. Now what if we could have our own communities or areas? Be surrounded by people you know? and in public we are all together. It may not be the brilliant idea that some people could beat out with better ones, but with all the issues we have with each other if you could just step away and not be bombarded with the class of cultures from time to time I just had a thought maybe you could decompress and actually be more understanding or even take it upon yourself to sit down and have a conversation and learn about cultures like I enjoy doing when I meet new people.

While we travelled we chatted about kangaroos and Crocodile Dundee.

A moment that I REALLY admired during this clip was when Oprah said, "Stop it. Let him speak. He has a right to speak "   despite the fact that he held views that damage people of her \textbf{race}. I think being able to listen even when you're listening to something as egregious as \textbf{racist} vitriol is important for multiple reasons.  At the very least, it allows people to recognize why a harmful mindset is harmful in the first place. I don't think liberals these days are arbitrary and irrational with their "NO THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE" attitude (of which I am also guilty).  I think they are just fed up with the trivialization we give to views like \textbf{racism}, so we act very assertively and repeat that \textbf{racism} is wrong instead of saying why.  I just think if we want anything to change, Oprah's diplomatic approach is probably one of the better ways to go about it.  Don't tell people that they're wrong.

That's the fault of democrats. You seem to forget who made the income tax, the property tax, and the estate tax, Woodrow Wilson. Democrats do also increase taxes more than Republicans on average, just look at FDR, his tax \textbf{spike} was the biggest in history. Are you really against military spending, do you think we shouldn't have a military? Besides that, Democratic policies such as welfare, Medicare, and Social Security make up most of the deficit. Reagan's economic policies were fantastic in my opinion and if you give me details on how it is bad, I'll debate you, but blaming Republicans for all this is not just avoiding Democratic actions involved, but is also outright wrong in that Democrats tend to cause the poor fiscal policies you are claiming Republicans support.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Spike & \cellcolor{green!5}Religious Identity - Protestant & \cellcolor{green!5}1/167 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.599 \\  \hline

But their end game is the same. Crushing taxes, destruction of the middle class, \textbf{race} warfare and lying about things that are going on in the Middle East.

Sumer?  Babylon?  That's Iraq. And it's more than oil they are after. They want the land that was theirs at one point before humans began procreating beyond their control. And if you look at our economic status on paper, you'll see that America flourished while Clinton was in office. People made money hand over fist on the stock market during his presidency. But it was designed that way. Gave people a false security. And when Bush1 took over, a lot of people lost a lot of money. Then there was the housing collaps (Obama). Now we are in a full recession.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small There are alot of commenters with the same question along the lines of.."well if the whites want their own area and blacks arent trying to come there why does it matter"...prejudice should never be swept under the rug because its convenient or isn't an immediate threat to anyone. As a society we should strive to abolish as many instances of prejudice as we can. although peoples ideas of what is discriminatory can change from a person to person basis, the mass majority of modern society has realized and frowned upon the prejudice of hating a person based on something they cannot control like the pigment of their skin.If you want an argument based of practicality instead of my own opinion, think of this- if we as a whole let whites have their own communities that cutoff the entry of \textbf{black} folk there are many real world situations that this could cause problems for. If there were a natural disaster or a mass tragedy in a predominantly \textbf{black} area neighboring one of these "white societies", where would the refugees go? There would be no one near by for miles willing to help them before farther away people could come. What if one day having their own little town isn't enough? After being allowed to fester and breed the ideas of white supremacy in their own untouched nest, don't you think the extremists bound to arise will not settle just staying away from blacks? That's why we have hate groups like the KKK. Those KKK members weren't BORN with hate, it was taught, and over years it grew until giving blacks dirty looks and calling them slurs wasn't enough.. and then you have people being lynched and killed for their skin color. Point is, hate will grow as long as you let it exist. So although "white societies" may not have immediate affects if attempted, their long term affects keep \textbf{racism} and hatred alive and well, which must be stopped at all costs.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Racism & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/332 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.904 \\  \hline

Internet is not apart of culture so that statement was irrelevant. We stole their music from the get go when the country was introduced from rock and roll. Rock and roll started from the Jazz and Blues of \textbf{black} people mostly in Harlem and that music influenced one of the biggest rock stars of all time, Elvis Presley. The music that is mainly streamed out and listened to now, such as r\&b and pop, come from rock and roll which came from you know who. Music is a cultural aspect and I gave my example to why your statement about whites starting culture being false. Even before that, our ways of living in America in colonial times have been adopted from Native Americans so we have always borrowed from others. It is also rare to find a food or dish that is specific to this country. American food is basically the rest of the world's food with different inspirations. We have established our current culture mostly from influences from Hispanic, \textbf{Indian}, and \textbf{African} countries. We aren't original at all.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Kbrat ! Finally, I can't imagine how I would act and behave if I was contained in an area of in depth poverty. Do you know why? Because I have never lived in any one of those areas because I have something called "white privelage". I will probably never experience a lifestyle like blacks because I am sheltered by the government. I'm not prideful enough to admit that I have advantages other people are not blessed with due to unfortunate circumstances. So claiming you would never rob someone at gunpoint is absurdly inconsiderate and ignorant when you realize you will never know how it feels to be in a financial jam and what it can make people do. You have no clue how you would act if your choices were that limited. How can you be sure you won't kill or rob someone if it means you don't die of starvation, or your child gets fed, or you have a roof under your head. No one wants to die, the government placed blacks where they are today, and their choices and opportunities are limited. Living in a society like that I imagine would put you on edge from everyone, make you hostile, defensive, desperate for anything, and subjected to substances to brighten the day. All it takes to know that is \textbf{common} sense, and your inability to see that shows how impervious you are to other people's situations. That is how the United States works. If roles were reversed and we were put in the same environments as \textbf{black} people, your tune would change drastically because our \textbf{race} would not make us behave better when confronted with death.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Common, Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}3/278 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.079 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Kbrat ! How \textbf{black} people behave isn't a racial matter and that is why you are wrong. You believe because of "who they are", they can't make the best of their situations when it is still undetermined how we would behave in the same situations. They are victims of circumstance, not belligerent because of their skin color. You can say the same with any \textbf{ethnic} group that has ever been at the bottom of the barrel of social hierarchy. Jews and Hispanics have been looked at the same way at a certain point in time and it wasn't because they belonged to a certain group of people. It was because the people above them confounded the groups to the worst places of society where means of escaping it were very grim. Those people have all acted the same way as \textbf{black} people do today and it wasn't by choice. It was by circumstance. So don't act all high and mighty over a certain breed of people like an aristocrat just because your life wasn't thrown into the fire. You have too much pride for your own good.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Ethnic & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/187 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.604 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Kbrat ! Also, you can't act a color. That is impossible. Stating blacks can't behave in an orderly manner because they are shunned for "acting against their own \textbf{race}" is idiotic. Basically you are saying that we are the only ones allowed to act like we have \textbf{common} sense and if a \textbf{black} person does they are considered "whitewashed". Good behavior is not associated with being white. If a \textbf{black} person wants to act as a respectable human being, he should just be that and not called "white washed". You act like we are generally the best people on Earth. Whites in America are far from that. No human is perfect or should be judged based off the color of their skin and that is final.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Common, Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}4/126 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.175 \\  \hline

Although people can manipulate numbers, that manipulation doesn't remain concealed and the truth always come to light, because numbers don't lie. The numbers regarding \textbf{black} crime rates and blacks on welfare are solid. The numbers come from both leftist websites and rightist websites.The numbers are the same regardless of the political bias of the person reporting it. Leftist websites try and claim that whites receive welfare and commit crime at higher rates by showing total numbers, but their attempt at deception fails. Anyone who knows basic math can  look at the numbers and realize that if 3,000 murders are committed by whites and 2,000 murders are committed by blacks, then blacks are committing murder at higher rates.The total number for whites may seem like more, but if  the white population was equal to the \textbf{black} population(45 million), then amount of murders committed by whites would only be about 700 compared to 2000 by blacks.These numbers aren't the exact rates - I'm just giving an example. By the way, if the \textbf{black} population was equal to the white population (192 million), then the murder rate among blacks would put the number of people killed by blacks at 9600, as opposed to just 3000 by whites.I'll say it again: numbers don't lie.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!5}3/233 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.288 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I'm a \textbf{black} man and if anyone says that someone like Trump or even the Republican party is \textbf{racist}, then they do not know history or politics (but can vote smh). It was the Democratic party that was in favor of slavery and against the abolishment of slavery. The Democratic party were the ones that voted no on allowing blacks to vote. It was them who put in \textbf{Jim C\textbf{row}} laws, gave rise to the Ku Klux Klan and protected it politically for DECADES. It was the Democratic party who gave blacks welfare, food stamps and various entitlements which tore apart the \textbf{black} family because the state replaced the father in the household. The reason is because \textbf{black} women decided that they don't need a man around anymore when they can live off the state by having a kid, as a result single motherhood skyrocketed as well as crime which is a direct correlation, and food stamps in \textbf{Black} American has increased by 58 under Obama by the way. They are the ones responsible for \textbf{racism} in America whatever \textbf{racism} there ACTUALLY is, they have been the scourge of our community since the time of Jefferson and Jackson, they brought on the war, they were in favor of segregation after the war, they are the result of high unemployment especially in the \textbf{black} community. And for the Obama's, the Clinton's and the rest of these baby tyrants, as well as the morons that follow them, to tell us Republicans that we're \textbf{racist}?!?!?!?!? THEIR ENTIRE LEGACY is \textbf{RACISM} and SEGREGATION. This can be traced all the way back to the founder. Pull out a \$20 bill, the man on it is the founder of the Democratic party Andrew Jackson who had 300 slaves and was considered a plantation elitist.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Crow, Jim Crow, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}12/298 & \cellcolor{green!27}4.027 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Joshua Brown That's true. The Republican Party has been in favor of a free market and less government regulations on business for its entire lifespan, and I can't think of any policies that would better help advance \textbf{Black} America. A free market allows any person, \textbf{black} or otherwise, the ability to earn money and then invest that money to move upward in social status. I really wish that more \textbf{black} people saw that the more the government has power over them, the harder it is going to be for their people to move up on the totem pole. I also think that Republicans these days need to do a better job reaching out to the \textbf{black} communities as they have not done well in recent history. One thing I really like about Donald Trump is that he did make an attempt to reach out to \textbf{Black} folks, and his numbers went up compared to what Romney did in 2016.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@november132Sorry folks was using the talk to text feature and sometimes it does pick up what I say accurately.  I have made some edits.I hate revisionist history. Not only did \textbf{black} people not start the slave trade but white people didn't stop it. What happened was and I'm going to paraphrase here because I really don't want to recite the history from memory. In 1412 5 European Kings in concert with the Pope decided to divvy up the world under the Church of \textbf{racism} and white supremacy. Their mindset was unification of Europe would promote world domination. This created the extermination of the Native Americans Holocaust of the Africans the whole enslavement of half of the world under European oppression. America in the sixteenth and seventeenth century culminated in this great experiment under the guise of theft of resources that was supposed to be brought back to Europe to support the European structure. Historically Europeans colonized both the Americas and coastal countries of Africa. Europeans decided to come into each country and propose false alliances setting two countries against each other giving guns to one side and selling guns to another taking human beings for profit. This was the fundamental promotion of the slave trade. Using that money the Europeans sold rum to Indians an opium to the Chinese. This was called the transatlantic slave trade. Enter the Gullah Wars there were many uprisings from the enslaved Africans who did not want to be slaves. Not only was there an unorganized resistance but there was also organised resistance. The Gullah Wars was started when runaway slaves took over Native American lands in Florida and merged with the Indians to fight United States government. The US government under Andrew Jackson lost in the Gullah Wars which fuel the Abolitionist Movement in both the South and in the North and ended up with the Trail of Tears.  The US government feared that all of the East Coast Native Americans would join the Gullah and take the country back.  The US government response was to march the remaining nations into the Midwest.The Civil War where white people claim to free \textbf{black} people was a combination of English interference in the United States and tariffs arguments while slavery was a factor it was not the only Factor nor was it the only cause of the war. At the end of the Civil War the United States created the 13th Amendment to the Constitution which states that no person shall be deprived of their rights without due process of law. The United States still have slavery it's just under the conditions in which you can become enslaved have changed. Which gave rise to the \textbf{Jim C\textbf{row}} laws and the current situation we deal with today which is the criminalization of the entire \textbf{African} American population. So in short, slavery has not ended in this country it simply has changed. If slavery had ended in this country the 13th Amendment would sound something like this no person Shelby deprived of their rights. I suggest you learn history before you debate with me. Now just for the record I can provide all kinds of sources and everything else to what I just said.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@John Locke​ oh it's worse than that. People like to ignore history. The reason why Japanese are xenophobic has to do with Europeans going into the country and taking over. It's around 14 45 roughly Europeans decided they were going to divvy up the entire world. The Dutch went into Japan because the pope told them to you know that whole thing about \textbf{racism} white supremacy and attempted to take over. When the Japanese discovered what was actually going on they kicked every European out of their country forbid Christianity to be practiced in Japan and killed every bit of infestation they found. They became an isolated country until Admiral Perry representing the United States and fired a cannon into the Imperial Palace and demanded that Japan open its borders. People fail to understand the historical events that lead to the things that are currently going on today. They used terms like \textbf{racism} and all that stuff because they truly do not understand why things going on and why things are the way they are. So they feel Justified saying I never owned slaves or I never did this or I never did that it doesn't matter. What matters is when people do things for your benefit and you are entitled you are going to be blamed for the actions that other people do in your name.

In addition to the reasons you stated, the existence of "\textbf{racism}" also serves to divide people and put them in opposition to one another. If you've read anything by Machiavelli you understand the advantage gained in dividing the commoners into small groups in opposition to one another. Whether it's on grounds of "\textbf{race}" or \textbf{nationality}, or religion, or whatever, that division is advantageous to the powers-that-be.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@mista butterworth.  Yes there are those differences in susceptability to diseases.  However a lot of those differences are because of differences in adaptions.  For example white people are more prone to skin cancer, when they live in hot climates. \textbf{Black} people who move to northern climes, where it is cooler, are more susceptible to Vitamin D deficiency because their ski. colour does absorb as.much sunlight. Asian people often are lactose intolerant as their traditional diets did not include as much diary.  however the point is that these differences do not perpetuate over generations.  For example I have noticed that most Australians of Anglo Celtic heritage  have slightly darker skin tones than our English counterparts.  I would guess that if nature was allowed to take its course white Australians will end up with much more olive complexations than our ancestors, in part because we do interbreed quite a lot and many Australians, who have ancestors that go back more than 2 generations, do mix racially.  Furthermore, after 100,000s of years I suggest we would end being brown or \textbf{black} - because of skin cancer. Natural selection would breed out the fairer skinned people who were more susceptible to skin cancer.  The so called differences between races are fluid.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@brontewcat The susceptibility brought about through eons of adaptation is what evolution is all about. Whether that manifests itself through genetic immunities and weaknesses, or something as seemingly superficial as skin tone makes little difference. Those varying paths of evolution that humanity has taken over the last couple hundred thousand years have made the different breeds what they are, as well as the cultures and languages that are synonymous with them… As far the current state of human evolution is concerned, the fairer skin types have most certainly shown no sign of being weeded out, quite the opposite. Skin cancer is not something that can be chosen out of a population through natural selection, and certainly couldn't have been long before anyone knew what it was. While it is more prevalent in lighter skinned races, like all forms of cancer, it is not \textbf{race} specific. And the more humans broke off into distinct types, the more those types have grouped together.

The thing is racists hate a certain \textbf{race} regardless of the way they live their lives, all they need to know about the particular person is their skin colour and that is enough for them to hate them. So are you saying that racists only pick and choose which \textbf{black} people to hate or that they assume all \textbf{black} people have the same morals etc?\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Race & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}5/109 & \cellcolor{green!27}4.587 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Tev I'm not putting it purely down to culture I'm saying that for the majority it's not just about skin colour like you suggested, I think it's more nuanced than that. The environment you are raised in is important. For example a white person living in a non-white ghetto would probably have a completely different outlook to a white person living in a gated white community. If you have never been exposed to the negatives of a particular culture then you probably wont understand the mindset of someone who has. If you are already of the opinion that the majority of people from this particular group behave in a way that you dislike, it's easier to apply these negative associations to all members of the group than it is to judge each person individually.Also humans and other animal species display a natural ingroup preference, trusting and welcoming people that don't look like you goes against millions of years of evolution, maybe for some people it's just innate. Others have probably made informed decisions, for example in Sweden 2 of the  population (non-native) commits 77.6 of the rapes, the situation is so bad that the police don't even record the ethnicities of the perpetrators anymore, because pretending there isn't a problem obviously makes it go away. When I hear something like that I don't think I could condemn a Swedish \textbf{woman} for choosing to not associate with people from that particular group. One way you can do that is by making a judgement call based on skin colour/appearance. It's discriminatory but there's rationale behind it. Ironically I think it's unwise to assume that all racists think the same way, some of them probably are as you described, maybe not mentally ill but too stupid to have any real opinions of their own, but I don't think most people that would be considered \textbf{racist} fit that stereotype.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Racist, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/316 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.633 \\  \hline

So then they gave people housing vouchers so they spread out to some suburban areas and the property values took a dive.  Some nice areas turned to ghettos.  So intown is now fancy condos and now all the minorities have to move out.  The white population keeps moving further out.

My observation is that there is no structural difference. At the core both are challenging the same feelings and ideas. \textbf{Racism} will never be eliminated because we discriminate in every part of our life, it's part of who we are and how we function. May be about what music we listen, what clothes to wear, what we will have for dinner, what job to pursue and so on. All we can do is to slow and easy eliminate or at least muffle as much as possible the bad parts, the parts which violate the rights and freedom of others. And that is achieved in time, a lot of it. 30 years is not even one generation and we can see substantial changes so maybe in 500-1000 years cultural differences will no longer be serious problems when it comes for people to live together. But for that to happen, current unrest and bumps are needed as part of the process.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Racism & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/211 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.474 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small This is why Oprah is gazed upon till this day. She did "\textbf{Jerry} Springier' things and made it clear and civilized. Seriously in the USA you could be living less then a couple blocks or street away from such an area. Every area where \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} lining occured in the past is still pretty much the same color. Next thing somebody who is \textbf{African} related moves in they have screwed up children, or cousins who everybody is afraid of. The women are preaching negativity as well as the men. So it is impossible to escape negative minded people  People build small communities only expecting people of there own kind to walk around the area. They are alienated shock to see somebody different come by, because they mostly use transportation. They have virtually a small town. White people live within distances of \textbf{black} people, only divided by transportation needs. One guy said; I have never been this close to a \textbf{black} guy before in his entire life. So the answer is yes they do exist. A good example is a co-op which looks like a group of houses but is classed as a building. They do not want anybody not European enough to move in and have excuses. But in a nutshell every single good looking place in the \textbf{nation} is just like that. Personally it is about living cheap and still escaping being around people of \textbf{African} decent. The biggest issue is that they have no money and no way of learning asides for grade school which does not block media ( like the stuff on youtube or prime time television ).

The Middle Eastern countries would take Africans as slaves well before this. Slavery in the \textbf{African} countries was \textbf{nothing} like slavery in the Americas. Slaves were considered human and they weren't lynched, castrated, eaten by dogs,  and ripped apart by horses like the Europeans did to punish slaves. Plus the slavery in Africa wasn't psychological, and it wasn't to destroy a whole \textbf{race} and break them down like the slavery the Europeans did. Slaves in Africa were prisoners of war and they where allowed there freedom after a set time. When the Europeans came along it pushed the Tribes in Africa in to an arms \textbf{race}.

She didn't just prove them wrong; she beat every single obstacle that life could possibly throw down and she won -- and rather than just relish that and ride away, she fought for what she believed in and did so in a society that was wholly against her. And I honestly don't feel she even sees it as the massive accomplishment it truly is; she pays homage to those that came before her (and rightfully so) but that does not negate her own achievements.I was born in 1986, and my exposure to her has pretty much been relegated to the "richest, most powerful \textbf{woman} in the world"; it's things like this that remind me who Oprah really is.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nothing, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/219 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.913 \\  \hline

I was born in 1986, and to imagine this being a popular consensus only 28 years ago is \textbf{nothing} short of appalling.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I knew this would be on here.  Our son's high school lit class is studying books on "stereotyping" and the results thereof.  I told him it would be interesting to "put the shoe on the other foot", so to speak, and let the students see how easily you can get wrapped up in bigotry, \textbf{racism}, and stereotyping simply by being born or raised in a particular place. So I was actually on here searching for the whole video.  Our family moved to Forsyth County in 1967, and lived there well after this horribly STAGED event (by the media) occurred.  Suffice it to say, the gentleman "Frank Shirley", if that was even his real name, was not a Forsyth OR Dawson County resident, and there NEVER WAS a "committee" of that nature in either county. \textbf{Racism} certainly DID exist, but it was not outward like it is portrayed in this video. Most of the people seen along the streets in the news footage were not from Forsyth County, or even Georgia!  They had come from as far as Alabama, Tennessee and South Carolina as a result of various and sundry "white supremacy" propaganda.  Personally, our family was from Atlanta -- our mother was a member of the media, and our father was a high school music director by day, jazz musician by night.  We had friends and visitors of all natures in our home, and we never learned hatred like what is seen in this montage.  Of course, it has been HIGHLY edited by OWN, but when it actually happened, the news media wanted to come to our church to film us during a worship service for NO REASON WHATSOEVER.  In fact, it was always funny to us that, if what they were after was preaching on or against the topic, they would choose the only progressive church in the county rather than one that was 100 or more years \textbf{old}. Whatever the case, many of our church members, and many other church groups, went out and served water to the marchers who came with Hosea Williams.  It is still disheartening to hear some of the things that were said, and yes, we still live close enough to the area and occasionally, some of the \textbf{old} timers still say the same things, but things have changed mightily, and for that, we are thankful.  The truth of the whole matter is this:  Mr. Hosea Williams attempted to lead a peaceful march through the city; the majority of people we knew went out to serve water and whatever needs they might have; but as usual, the media hyped it all up, incited riots, and then put the footage together so that it reflected as badly as possible on everyone concerned.  We all just need to stop all the hating and HELP one another, for time is short, and we're all in this boat together.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Old, Racism & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}4/481 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.832 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@PONYBOYonline I think what people who condemn these folks don't realize is that just as they themselves seek order, these people are trying to maintain the order and status quo as they see it. Many may not think their mindset is right, but the foundation for all our thoughts and concerns are the same. Theirs has led them to an ideology that isn't popular in this day and \textbf{age}. So we deem it evil and wrong. Disorder begins in the minds of each of us individual. And order will emerge from the thoughts of each of us when the time is right. Our level of consciousness is the same in this era. We can try and mask that fact with good deeds and political correctness. But if you sit in judgment on these people, how are we different than them. They are judging the world as they see it. And we judge them in return. They see certain things as evil. We see them as evil. We have the same level of consciousness. And like you said, we have the same level of emotional response too.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@ALFERD PACKER I think each of us must find a path that works for us in life. We are the creators of our own individual realities. There are shared realities, when you are at work, commuting to work, eating at a restaurant etc. But have you ever noticed how much control you have over the reality you create for yourself when you're alone in your home? It is during this time that you can play around with the notion of accepting things as they are, and not getting caught up in the things of the world. When I'm in my home, I control my reality. I don't watch tv, don't have cable. I don't watch the news etc. So I'm not blown to and fro on an emotional level by the day to day events presented on the nations newscasts. I didn't find out about the Boston Marathon bombings until two weeks after it happened. I don't ever think it's wise to get caught up in events that the world chooses to present to you. It's always best to be an observer, never a participant. If a riot breaks out, and disorder is the rule of the day, I can never add to the disorder by not participating. None participation will always reduce a situation, not add to it. But sometimes events beyond your control will require you to participate in situations not of your choosing. If there is a war going on, you may be drafted into it. If a ruthless dictatorship takes over your country, you may find yourself a slave or a servant. In these situations the control over your individual reality may be severely reduced, but you still have control over your reactions to things. This is where forgiveness and unconditional love come into play. These two things supersede right and wrong. Forgiveness overcomes wrongs and unconditional love rights all things. I don't sit around worrying about the so called right and wrong. There is \textbf{nothing} that states life is fair or that it should be. In this era the consciousness of humanity is the same across the board. We all live in fear, we all are slaves to our base desires, we all get angry at our fellow man, we have all lied, cheated and stolen. None of us are perfect. That's why I find it better not to get caught up in movements or conspiracy theories or even right and wrong. I let society govern itself. We have Civil laws to govern the worst offenders amongst us. I let them do their job. The problem with most people is they get caught up in the system. They think democracy or what ever form of government they live under is something to hold onto. The conspiracy theorists who think they need to overthrow powerful men who they believe seek to control the destiny of the world, are no different from them. Why? Because the conspiracy theorist seek to control our destiny too. They want reality to be as they see it. How is that any different in thought than the mega powerful among us who do  the same thing. If we go from a biblical stand point, at every turn the Godly command is to come out of her my people. Meaning to come out of Egypt, come out of Babylon, come out of Greece and Rome. If you want true control over your life, you have to come out of the Man made systems in place, and live harmoniously with nature. You must walk away. I'm still in the system, so are you, so we are part of the problem on some level. I reduce that by not getting caught up in it as much as I can. I do this until I can find a clear way to leave it all behind altogether. Until that time, I won't seek to tear the system down or change it. I let the system be the system. When Jesus was asked should the Jews pay taxes, he asked whose face was on the coin. The Priests responded Cesar's. Jesus then told them, "Give to Cesar what is Cesar's". So I let the system be the system. I try to be in the world, but not of the world. So don't worry about the so called evils in this world. These things may always be amongst us. The only power you have is to choose the path you walk daily. I have chosen mine and it gives me great peace. You'll have to do the same, and I hope some of what I've said here will help guide you.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}1/772 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.13 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@knossis1​ You could add any racial slur to my comment, towards any \textbf{race}, and it would sound \textbf{racist}. But what I said is not. Even though we all have flaws and set backs, some of us actually feel bad about and try to change those things - in my opinion that is a good person. There are people who are so filled with hate, who have no remorse, and actually get a high from mistreating others - that is a bad person. I would prefer if everyone had a good conscience\& they listened to it, and worked to better themselves, but it just is not that way. I do understand what you are saying about loving all and not judging, and I try to approach most things that way, but I've learned that some people are a lost cause and only an intervention from God can change them. Those kinds of people are untrustworthy and dangerous. I'm looking at this from a survival and flourish perspective. And you are very correct - with population growth, we would eventually be forced together again. As far as a war at my door step, nice doesn't mean weak. I do not mean that we should literally separate in that way, I just feel that in order to have a huge, lasting positive change in this world, those who will stand up for what is honorable need to stand together. I firmly believe that those who are reckless toward eachother and their enviornment (to a massive extent) would have been extinct at their own hands if it weren't for those who work hard at making this world a liveable place i.e. \textbf{doctors}, firemen, caregivers, those who feed the hungry and help the sick, those who protect and build safe living environments, etc. I feel like the ones who are self-centered and careless of life do not contribute to our exsistance, they only drain us of recourses (again, from a survival and flourish stand point).\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Race, Racist, doctors & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/330 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.909 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Sandra Hopkins Some of the things you mention regarding recklessness, survival and resource management are the foundation or bedrock concerns of many groups who want to separate from others who they deem are a drain on such things. I think the big mistake many people make is looking at this world as if it has any permanence. Science has proven it doesn't. The Universe is blinking in and out of existence daily. The earth is destroyed and recreated daily. Our existence is illusionary at best. Our universe is holographic in nature. A hologram created within every individuals mind. When we hold on to the things of this world as if they were something to fight for or stand up for, we miss the big picture. We miss the eternal things that do matter.  Things like wave form energy, particle wave duality etc. The fact that before each of us manifest in human forms our carbon atoms  where born within stars. We have always been here in one form or another. Each of us is the Universe made manifest. As the bible says The Kingdom of Heaven is within us. We are much greater than the world around us. Don't get caught up in good or evil. They are just labels that separate. The Universe cares little for your perceived morality. Most of the food many American's find on their plate isn't grown in America, on American soil. Many people in South America live in poverty so that we can enjoy the life we have here. American foreign policy ensures that these countries have leaders that will allow us to export their goods at rate and price to out liking. It's easy to sit back and judge others and say they are irredeemable, never realizing that our very existence in the world almost ensures someone will die and suffer elsewhere. Material existence is an epp and flow in have and have not. For someone to rise, someone must fall. \textbf{Nothing} we do here has any bearing on cosmology. There is no good or evil. There just is. The penalty for all our activity, be it so called good or evil is the same. That penalty is encoded in the flesh, and it is called Death.  The penalty is carried out by the Weak Nuclear Force. All men will die, no matter if they are good or evil. The reward is also the same, no matter if you live a righteous or unrighteous life. The reward is we are all born again. We are given new name, a new  Mother, a new Father, a blank mind, or clean slate. Having no memories of our previous lives or circumstances. This is the cycle of life. We see it happening around us daily. A continuous cycle of life, death and rebirth. The Universe is going through the same cycle of life and rebirth daily also. The ancients knew these things, their societies were based off of the study of astronomy and many other fields of science. They wrote mythologies about their science. Many of our modern religions most sacred books contain these stories. We foolish focus on the surface, on words like good and evil. Looking quickly for justification to judge one another's actions. Never realizing when we judge, we are just as flawed as the people we are judging. Like I have said, there is \textbf{nothing} to be gained for doing good or evil. For all things we see pass away daily. But the wise man chooses the righteous path, not because he seeks favor or reward, but because he is wise and can clearly discern the beginning and end of all things. Judgments will always lead to separation, which will always lead to greed, envy and eventually war. And with War, many will find death at their door step a lot quicker than the Weak Nuclear Force intended. In life each of us will have to find our on path to wisdom. The wise among us will give ourselves the room to do that without judgment and condemnation.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}2/676 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.296 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Sandra Hopkins Sandra a big misconception amongst religious people is they don't understand the stories that are gathered together in the bible. They don't understand the societies and cultures that the stories were written under. They don't understand the world view of the ancient civilizations under which these mythologies were written. What we do is try and have the stories make sense to us today. And the stories were not written with us in mind. Just like many of our contemporary mythologies and stories aren't written with future civilizations in mind. The concept of Heaven and Hell are grossly misunderstood. Hell is not a literal place of burning the evil are sent to. There is no literal hell. All the stories in the bible are based on ancient science and cosmology. Genesis is not the story of the creation of our Universe. It's the creation of a Heavenly parallel earth that surrounds  our literal earth. It's called the Celestial Sphere. The ancients mapped the heavens by creating the Celestial sphere around our earth. That created the constellations made to look like men, women and animals and used the shapes as navigational tools as they migrated from place to place. They wrote stories about their science of astronomy. It was a way for them to never get lost in their travels across the globe. Today we have GPS, in ancient times the whole world used the celestial sphere as their GPS. There science was much deeper than that, but I'm just trying to give you a surface understanding of things. If we were do look at the story of Genesis from a scientific stand point, The very fact that plant life is created on the third day and the sun on the fourth, is a big problem. There can be no plant life on earth with out the process of photosynthesis. The Sun is needed for Photosynthesis to occur. Other things like talking serpents and flaming swords are dead give aways that the stories are mythological in nature. So it really does no good to try and understand the concepts of good or evil through the eyes of mythological aspect of Hell. In the New testament the Greek word that is translated into evil is poneros, which means labor, work or hardship. From the biblical perspective man labor or work is seen as a curse upon man. It is evil because man can not see his relationship with nature and the freedom provided by such a union, when he has to work laboriously, and pay money for food that nature gives to us freely. In Genesis God is said to have told Adam that because of the fall, the ground of the earth was cursed and man would now have to labor for his food. So from the biblical standard labor or work is evil and a curse upon man kind. So in essence every one of us who works are labors at a job is doing evil. We are disconnected from nature and live counter to it. In today's society when we use the word evil, we think of things like murder, rape, stealing, lying etc. But that's not how the ancients saw evil. Evil was any man made work or labor that took us away from a harmonious relationship with the heavens(Celestial Sphere) and nature. Even the concept of a Soul is misinterpreted. In the Genesis myth God is said to have formed man from the dust of the ground first and then God breathed into the form the breath of life second, and man became a living Soul or being. A Soul is not some ethereal spirit with in man. A Soul is man. Meaning from the myths stand point God combined two things to make a third separate thing. God's breath + The dust God form Man out of  became a third thing = A living Soul or being. The word Hebrew word translated into Soul means Being. So every Man, \textbf{Woman} and Child manifested in physical form is a Soul from the biblical perspective. And what causes many of us to have so called bad intentions toward each other is disenfranchisement, the haves and have not's. It all comes down to resources and the earth not producing enough to go around. So in the end, like it says in the New Testament, There is no one who is good, not even one. We are all evil, we are all part of the problem. That's why in the mythologies within the New Testament, they bring up Grace and say we all, the righteous and unrighteous live under Grace. Meaning the Universe blesses us all equally. The punishment for all our labor and activity on earth whether it be labeled good or evil is the same. Genesis says that punishment is death and we all die no matter what type of life we have lived. The Universal reward is the same too, we are all born again as babies, given a new name, a new Father and Mother. The science hidden in the stories of the bible is much deeper than what I'm presenting here but I hope you get what I'm saying and have a better understanding  of illusionary terms like good and evil.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/877 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.114 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@knossis1​Thank you for sharing that it is very interesting.  I do know that the bible was written in a different time and with a way to describe things as they existed then. I also realize that many of the stories are mythological, and for the purpose of passing down certain beliefs.I do, however, believe that future generations were held in mind when many of the verses were written, and it states that throughout the entire bible. I still believe that rape, murder, etc. Can be lab led as evil, even with that understanding because it does take us away from a harmonious relationship with the heavens and nature. I believe it goes against the flow to a \textbf{common} good(I use the word good to describe the absence of hate, murder, etc). If no man/woman ever has intentions to be kind or helpful, some may survive, but I believe our lives would not  be as long or productive in helping further generations along.I also believe that who we are/our choices do affect our next life - where we end up and how much suffering we endure.While I love to learn and appreciate intellectual conversation, I was only speaking of human behavior when I said "good and bad". And cannot be convinced that there is no such thing as good/bad behavior because I have lived it. I have also had two near death experiences in my life and during so, experienced a piece of heaven and a very vivid piece of hell. I must tell you that those experiences were while I did not believe in either and was against any form of spirituality. I have seen evil and it exsists not only within us but all around us. I have seen good and it too exsists within and around us. They are the yin and the yang - they are the "balance"of this world.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Common & \cellcolor{green!5}Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}1/313 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.319 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Sandra Hopkins You should check out a book called the Holographic Universe. It would give you a scientific provable explanation to what you saw during your near death experience and exactly what created what you saw. I equate near death experiences to something equivalent to our dream state. A state in which we are either astral traveling to other dimensions or our Holographic minds are creating these dimensions or Universes on the fly. None of us have all the answers regarding life, concepts like good or evil. But I know the Universe is a Loving one. It graciously endures all of humanities failing without condemnation.  And as 1 Corinthians  4 through 5 states, " Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs." The Universe operations on these same principles. It doesn't operate from the human stand point. for isn't the heavenly above the human or earthly. We keep record of wrong doing but the Universe does not. If we are to align ourselves with the heavenly, then why do we continue to think from a lower earthly standpoint. I don't worry about what good or evil mankind does to one another, I forgive and move on. I can guarantee any man or \textbf{woman} this, as long as their minds are set on earthly matters, on concepts like good and evil. Who is bad, who is not. They will continue to be reborn on with that level of consciousness until the full realization of these heavenly or universal concepts of Love , forgiveness, mercy and no judgments are brought fourth through the living of many life times. It is hard for many to grasp these notions in this \textbf{age}, this level of consciousness.  But it's best to leave the judgment of mortal men and women to the heavens first and the civil authorities second. The heavens has embedded the same judgment within all matter, from the stars to all biological life. That judgment is death, doesn't matter what type of life you have lived,  the judgment is balanced, its the same for one and all. The Civil courts aren't so good at their jobs, some are rightly convicted, some are wrongly convicted. It's not balanced, that's why the heavens supersede the earthly. You want a proper judgment for all universal activity look toward the heavens. You want an improper judgment for human activity, look toward the earthly.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/427 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.468 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Connor D You're right, but that's \textbf{black} and white thinking again, it's really everything, everything is paradoxical.\textbf{Racism} can be a lot of different things, hating someone purely by the color of their skin is \textbf{racism}, but when you don't accept certain behavior linked to people of a certain \textbf{race} or culture is \textbf{racism} as well.So you're right, it will always exist, and it's normal to link certain behavior to certain groups of people, stereotyping is functional, it makes us able to organize things in our minds.But the exception makes the rule.In social groups we always seek out who we belong to the most, prison is a great example of how \textbf{racism}, or fascism works.If everyone was literally mixed up though, and every \textbf{race} was mixed, \textbf{racism} wouldn't even make sense anymore in the long run.I'm not naive enough to believe that our world will ever reach a point that we all get along though, but it's possible to some extent.I think you should be able to laugh at racial differences as well, \textbf{black} comedians laugh at whites all the time, while being certainly offensive, and maybe \textbf{racist}, I can still appreciate how they portray our differences.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Race, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}10/203 & \cellcolor{green!27}4.926 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small There are places in the extreme north and northwest parts of the U.S. that have few if any \textbf{black} people. There it's not so much about \textbf{racism} as the fact that slavery wasn't practiced much there (so not many \textbf{black} families that go way back) and some places are extremely rural (so not many jobs to draw in people from outside). What they aren't telling you about Forsyth county is that it's the wealthiest county in Georgia. The median income there is about \$84,000. In 2008 it was ranked the 13th wealthiest county in the entire U.S. Obviously not all \textbf{black} people are poor. Some are quite wealthy. But the vast majority of \textbf{black} people who might like to move to this county simply can't afford to do so. While there are no doubt a considerable number of white people in the county that actively move against \textbf{black} people moving in, money is a much bigger factor. Just speculating here, but it wouldn't surprise me if some of the very wealthy white people living in this county make it a point to outbid any \textbf{black} people they find winning a bid on a house. It would be especially easy to do if they own and operate the real estate companies in the county. In 1912 a white \textbf{woman} was raped in Forsyth county, allegedly by a \textbf{black} man who allegedly later brought some of his \textbf{black} friends over to rape her some more. She died a short time later from pneumonia thought to be contracted from spending all night out in the woods naked. One of the accused men was killed by an angry mob in his jail cell. The rest were sentenced to death in court and hung. White vigilantes ended up running off an estimated 98 of the \textbf{black} population of the county in the following months. They weren't with the KKK as the original KKK, which was formed in the aftermath of the Civil War, had ceased to exist long before back in 1871. Later though some of the people involved became members of the KKK when it restarted in the 1920's. By the 1920 census, only 30 non-whites lived in the county. However, by the 2010 census, only 85 of the population was white (still higher than normal). Anyhow, that's a county in Georgia ended up with such an outrageously high percentage of white people.Over the last several decades, the Atlanta area has grown enormously. Demand for places to live has skyrocketed.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@SinginSoldierNoCal Diversity in a city does not create wealth. It's a nice sentiment and it would be cool if it were true, but it isn't. That would be mixing cause and effect. Wealth is what creates diversity, not the other way around. Wealthy areas have jobs and benefits like well funded schools, high end medical care, etc. If you started with 100 wealthy white people in an area, the hordes of people seeking jobs and other benefits would quickly produce a high amount of minority representation. The fact that this wealthy county is not chock full of minorities is surprising because normally such wealth would create a large minority population even if there wasn't one before. There's a reason for that which goes back to a racially charged incident in 1912, but I'm not going into that here.\textbf{Nobody} wants to live in Forsyth county? Are you kidding me?In 1990, a few years after this video was made in 1987, the population was about 44,000.In 2000, it was about 98,000In 2010, it was about 175,000.In 2013, it's estimated it was about 195,000.

It's very close to Atlanta and people who work in the incredibly fast growing Atlanta area are desperate to find a place nearby where they can afford to live.

I don't know which \textbf{black} people like you or dislike you or anyone else. I believe part of the problem is we all sometimes tend to generalize. I believe there is not much worse bigotry than when a \textbf{black} person is anti \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} or when a \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} person is anti \textbf{black} or whatever other insane bigotry.There are huge  numbers of \textbf{black} people who are racists. \textbf{Nation} of Islam is filled with bigots. There are a lot of racists who are white idiots too. I believe it's a human problem of ignorance \& fear. Those two things lead to anger which leads to hate. It's shameful there is still bigotry going on in the US today yet most of it is directed against \textbf{L\textbf{G\textbf{BT}}} at this time. Science proves homosexuality is as natural and normal as \textbf{race} but some are too ignorant or indoctrinated into a form of religion to understand reality.Things are better than 30 years ago and much better than 60 years ago but once \textbf{racism} and \textbf{homophobia} ends, humans will find something else to pick on people for which is why it's a human condition of \textbf{mental} illness. BTW, I'm white \& I don't hate anyone. I base like vs dislike on the individual but even if I dislike someone, I don't hate. I might dislike how someone is acting or how they behave yet I know people can change for the better so there is at least one person out there who doesn't hate you.

Education in subjects such as Math, physics etc do not carry the same ideological baggage as say History and sociology which can be grossly skewed/misrepresented depending on what ideology you want to push. The elites that rule over us at the moment have deemed that egalitarian Marxism is the ideology which is best for us and anyone who disagrees or dissents is a hateful bigot. A great example of this is the comment left below by Vinicius Martins; he's spouting verbatim the same clichéd egalitarian idiocy that he was indoctrinated with without even questioning its logic: "we are all the same" and "we all bleed \textbf{r\textbf{ed}}" what does that even mean?

There were, in fact 2 elite societies in the early 20th Century.  One was the more Bohemian society, and there was another, more conservative.  BOTH are playing for the minds of a glib, unsuspecting public.  This public regurgitates what they've been trained to think.  Why is Malcolm X and Marcus Garvey regarded less than Martin Luther King and Mandela?  SUBMISSION.  Easy.  And I LOVE Malcolm X.  If people could cut the hyper-sensitive, reactionary talk....they'd see he was light years ahead of King.  And if \textbf{Black} Americans walked on Malcolm's path (AFTER he separated from the \textbf{Nation} of Islam) they'd be more self-sufficient, today.  The elite knew this (particularly those who want dependency) \& knew Malcolm was the greater threat.  I may not agree with all your points, nor David Duke's points.....but, some are valid \& I'm not hyper-sensitive.  I'm very much against the violence \& lynching.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Emmanuel Owusu First of all guys, the bone of contention of my comment was the high cost of education in America. I never intended it to be a platform for \textbf{racism} and for those who think skin color has anything to do with intelligence, o well, go ask Dr. Benjamin Carson.The America i see today, compared to what our founding fathers saw with their minds eye, is awful. We're 7th in literacy, 27th in math, 22nd in science, 49th in life expectancy 178th in infant mortality, 3rd in median household income, 4th in labor force, 4th in exports, etcGuess what we lead the world in: Number of incarcerated citizens per capita and defence spending.The America that i heard and read about waged war on poverty and not poor people, made ungodly technological advances, cured diseases, and cultivated the world's greatest economy. We reached for the stars and acted like men. We aspired to intelligence and did not belittle it. Why? Because we had an informed citizenry. \textbf{Race} is an issue. But i won't talk about \textbf{racism}. I prefer to talk about education. If that ghetto guy was educated, succeeded in business or had a career, no one would be scared of him. Wouldn't matter if he was white, \textbf{black}, hispanic or whatever. Ladies and gentlemen, we need to reinvent our system of education, make it more affordable to the average man or \textbf{woman} on the street who has no parents or help from anyone in society. We need to make education affordable so that when students graduate from college, they wouldn't be so much burdened with enormous student loans and the likes. I have so much more heartfelt comments to make...i would pause here though and solicit your concerns as well.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Race, Racism, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}5/293 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.706 \\  \hline
