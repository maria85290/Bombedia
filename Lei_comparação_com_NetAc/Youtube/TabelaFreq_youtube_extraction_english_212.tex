  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I'm so glad you put this video out. It makes everything so much clearer. When I was beaten, called names based on the color of my skin for 2 years and eventually raped in a Detroit school, that was bigotry. What made it reverse \textbf{racism} is when the teachers wouldnt do anything because I was the only white kid in the school and it would look like preferential treatment, when the principle said they wouldnt do anything because I was white, when the superintendent said they wouldnt do anything because I was white and therefore must have instigated it (I was 7 years \textbf{old}), and when we couldnt file a police report because the \textbf{black} cop told me I didnt know what \textbf{racism} felt like, or when every lawyer we went to (all \textbf{black}) refused to take our case because we were white so this wasn't a case of \textbf{racism}. In Detroit, in the 90's all the power was in the hands of a \textbf{race} that was not mine. Since bigotry+ power equals=\textbf{racism}. Thanks for proving to me, and the world that reverse \textbf{racism} exists. No, reverse \textbf{racism} does not exist. Racists who happen to be POC exist. Deal. With. The.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Thank you for this basically already debunked video, I'm just going to examine the matter on a deeper level.First of all, there is no "correct definition" of anything. Words do not have some external meaning outside waiting to be discovered all the way. Language, too, is a social construct as we all know. So then how do we assign unique definitions to unique words to reduce ambiguity? Simple. We agree on it. But to pick a definition to agree on is based on practicality of using the same word. Sometimes, a same word can have 2 or more definitions, depending when is it used. Consider the word "theory". When we casually use it, we use it as a synonym to a "hypothesis, opinion, possibility" and that is the philosophical definition of theory. It has its purpose in casual talk, "I have a theory that Rachel is hiding something behind your back". The scientific definition, however, is a hypothesis that continues to get along with evidence we have found (or something along those lines). Gravitational theory, theory of evolution. It's useful because scientists can differentiate a plain hypothesis and a theory with \textbf{zero} ambiguity.Of course, the problem arises when we confuse the definitions. This is the case when creationists argue that evolution is "just a theory". A very famous and irritating thing to happen between the arguing of theist and atheist communities (I didn't wanna bring this up but whatever I'm trying to split the cookie)Your point about cars is plainly wrong. A false analogy to be exact. The mechanics don't define what a car is any differently, they just know car better. Sociologists don't have an ultimate authority on a word. The word may be tied to them, but they know the concept of the word better, not the word itself.Now it's time to apply logic to this debate. When to use the "prejudice+power" definition that we either hate or love? For us non-sociology mortals, we don't use it unless we refer to a sociologist discussion where it is used. When we refer to someone else's topic, we play on their field. But we should generally use the "prejudice/discrimination" definition.For sociologists, they are allowed to use the "prejudice+power" definition so long it doesn't create ambiguity and it helps resolve the \textbf{racism}-related problem within a state. Idk what sociology works with so I can't say anything in its name but there may be cases.But when does the "prejudice+power" definition fail? Ask enough "what ifs" and you'll see. What if there is a state with perfectly no power of any \textbf{race} over another. Who is \textbf{racist} there? What is there are two states, one is white-dominated, one is \textbf{black}-dominated. A white person online offends a \textbf{black} person from the other state. Is it \textbf{racist}? A white person from the first state migrates to the second state. Does their ability to be \textbf{racist} vanish into \textbf{thin} air? Or maybe let's refer to the white country again. What if there are two oppressed races and a member of one is prejudiced against another? Answer all of these questions, and you will get contradictory answers guaranteed. Unless you deny that \textbf{racism} is a property of an individual and that is a quality a state possesses. Then no individual is technically \textbf{racist}. And who wants to work with that?Or, perhaps sociologists could make up a new word to take the "prejudice+power" definition, like idk, racimism. This would resolve or reduce the ambiguity.\textbf{Racism} is not a complicated issue until you allow it to be so.Thank you for your shared time reading this.

Wearing a blonde wig and faking a british accent is pretty \textbf{racist}. You have the power because its your Youtube channel and video. You see power is all perspective. So if you have more power socially than others you too can be \textbf{racist} by your own logic. You didnt see that because you are psychologically going to take the easy way out and stop when it comes to looking at yourself and where you stand. Its alot easier to look at others and point a finger and judge them. Just live your life and do the best you can do without looking for reasons to be excuses so you can make yourself feel better about your own shortcomings in life.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I am officially entering the matrix. Dear people in the comments section.   I'm going to take the time to answer all of you because your pretentious tone annoyed me and you may have the opportunity to learn something. First, let's take a collective deep breath! You're in for a bumpy ride. Let's start by exploring the fact that American institutions were built on the concept of white supremacy at the exclusion of others. With rare and notable exceptions these institutions were and are steeped in long traditions of legal white supremacy throughout our most important public and consequently private institutions. Let's take for example the judicial system. A system that continues to oppress \textbf{black} and Latinx Communities through their disproportionate sentencing. This is quantified by the way- there is research available. Feel free to google that. Another breath might be useful here. Another great example is the legislative branch. Politicians (particularly republicans) have tried to suppress the vote of people of color, in particular the \textbf{black} vote , and poor people at large (poor people references a group that has a larger number of white people than most realize but it disproportionately affects communities of color). This is also quantifiable, so fell free to google away. Now I think it's important that we engage in a dialogue regarding the treatment of people of color (particularly \textbf{black} folks) in this country. But it's more important that we come to that conversation well informed and with real substantive research on the topic. I also think it's important to find the growing number of research that has been done on what \textbf{racism} actually does to the brain and behavior of the white person or non \textbf{black} person . There is ample research available on peoples reactions to conversations on \textbf{race} because it's important to recognize the signs that lead white folks to experience white fragility (which all of you seem to be suffering from)  and the ample other defense mechanisms that have been developed to deny difference and responsibility. It is not the responsibility of people of color to educate you on these inequities, but if you are going to make these assertions that these things are making it look like 'whites' are out to get you, it that is just social justice propaganda you need to sit down and do some  research. Also don't hide behind your ridiculous contempt for education. Those of us who've spent considerable money on higher education also have substantive criticisms of our educational institutions while at the same time understanding their value in understanding our complex world.So happy googling...\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Race, Racism & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}6/433 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.386 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Mikayla Bonner So educate me. Like I am foing to you.Today I'm going to tell you why the argument for that \textbf{black} people cant be \textbf{racist} is a myth. The most \textbf{common} argument is privlage plus power. Or the power structures argument. It is the notion that because that white people have not been oppressed back then society that they can be \textbf{racist} toward them.1: The SJW definitions which stipulate that \textbf{racism} and \textbf{sexism} must be systematic are not found in any dictionary.2: We are going to break down white privilege. White people do not have any edge in America in today's society and government. The reason that people think otherwise is because people want equality of outcome not equality of opportunity. We have equality of opportunity which means that \textbf{black} people can do as much as white people with out discrimination. But what people fail to understand is that if we had equality of outcome that would mean that we would have created a society that does not support work because you no matter how good you would do in the job you would not get more money so in turn you would not be incentivised to work harder. This has already been tried and it faild you might know it as \textbf{communist} Russia.Now for power. \textbf{Black} people can can be elected by the people to the highest office in the land twice in a row. For eight years. Now I dont know what that tells you other than \textbf{black} people can get into any powerful position in the world. But again this comes back to people wanting equality of outcome. The reason that white people hold more powerful positions it because there culture. Now this is vague so I will explain. Asian culture is centered around getting a college degree and getting a high paying job. But on the other side \textbf{black} people do the opposite they shun people who who want to learn. So before you come and attack white people because they hold positions that \textbf{black} people can get why dont you ask why are they not motivated to get to those positions.So now that we have broken down the fundamentals of the argument and disproved them I ask you why do you think that reverse \textbf{racism} is real.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Common, Communist, Racism, Racist, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}13/388 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.351 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small You claim, and I am paraphrasing, that the dictionary definition of \textbf{racism} is wrong. What I mean by that is you    claim that having institutionalized power is a prerequisite for being \textbf{racist} and the dictionary definition saying otherwise proves \textbf{nothing}. It is absolutely true that dictionaries can be wrong, I am not going to argue that. However, I request for anyone who wants to alter the official meaning of \textbf{racism}, the burden of proof is on them to explain why the definition has to be altered and their definition should be accepted instead. Every time someone   who believes that power structures argument to makes sense attempts to explain why the dictionary definition is   wrong, the answer is always a clear demonstration of circular reasoning. Said conversation usually goes      something like this. Erica, who is white, argues with a \textbf{black} man named Tyrone. Erica calls Tyrone out for being \textbf{racist} toward white people.Tyrone responds with 'I am not \textbf{racist}, reverse \textbf{racism} is not real.' Tyrone's response assumes that \textbf{racism} towards  white people is impossible. Erica responds 'You are correct, it is not reverse \textbf{racism}. It is just \textbf{racism}.' Tyrone responds by saying '\textbf{Nothing} I say can be \textbf{racist}, because \textbf{racism} equals prejudice plus power and white  people have all the power.' Erica informs Tyrone that the definition of \textbf{racism} that he is claiming is not cited in any dictionary.Tyrone tells Erica that the dictionary is wrong, because only people with insitutionalized power can enforce \textbf{racism}. Tyrone's conclusion is that you cannot be \textbf{racist} towards white people, and at each point in the argument, Tyrone   presents an argument predicated on the assumption that his conclusion is true. Even if it were true that power is a prerequisit for \textbf{racism}, the type of power identified in the privilege plus power argument is an arbitrary option taken from many different forms of power. The five types of power are formal     authority (power derived from a title, ex. president, senators, court justices, etc.) expertise (power derived from     knowledge of a subject, \textbf{doctors}, scientists, etc.) coercion (power to enforce a punishment, ex. police) rewards  (power to rewrad someone, usually done with money or something extrinsic but can also use intrinsic things like   praise) AND persuassion (ability to convince someone of something). Both white and nonwhite people are capable of both having and not having any one of these types of power. The prejudice plus power argument identifies the  power aspect of the equation the ability to enforce prejudice on a societal level through institutions. Not only does this identify the form and scope of power that the person making the argument thinks matters while excluding all  other types of power, it arbitrarily draws boundaries that itself needs justification in my opinion. But you know what, just for the sake of argument, let's assume that institutional power is actually a prerequisit for being \textbf{racist}. The    prejudice plus power argument is still a non-sequiter. All that follows from the claim that institutionalized power is the only way to enforce \textbf{racism} is that those with institutionalized power can be \textbf{racist} towards people without     institutionalized power. It does NOT follow logically that only white people can be \textbf{racist}. Two other assumptions  would need to be made in order to arrive at the conclusion that only white people can be \textbf{racist}. Those two      assumptions are all positions at all levels of power are held by white people and that all citizens who are the same \textbf{race} as the people in power are somehow magically able to enforce their own \textbf{racism} simply by virtue of being the same \textbf{race} as people in power. The first assumption is not true, we have had a \textbf{black} president and there are \textbf{black} people in congress. The reason why the second assumption is so unbelievably crucial is because unless that is the case, it follows logically that those who are not parts of powerful institutions cannot be \textbf{racist}, even if the first    assumption is true. However, white person who are not part of a powerful institution are no more capable of    enforcing their beliefs than any citizen of color who is not part of a powerful institution.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Nothing, Race, Racism, Racist, doctors & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}29/693 & \cellcolor{green!5}4.185 \\  \hline

Of course institutions and governments can be racists, but look at the broader term and by that definition, any \textbf{race} can be \textbf{racist}.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The tote about how white people never face institutionalized discrimination is demonstrably false. If you try to claim that institutionalized discrimination against white people does not exist, I invite you to look up the history of Irish and Italian Immigrants in the United States, the public perception of Germans in the early 20th century and the treatment of Jews basically anywhere outside of Israel. I know that not all Jewish people are white, Judaism is a \textbf{race}. What I am saying is that Jewish people face systemic discrimination, despite the fact that some Jewish people are white. To that you might say that I am referencing a different time and place, the power structures argument is only talking about modern day America. The fact that geography makes a difference really only helps support my point, but you know what, let's focus on modern day America. Racially motivated hate crimes happen to white people. Granted, they happen to racial minorities more frequently, but FBI statistics from 2013 report that about one fifth of all racially motivated hate crimes in that year were motivated by anti-white sentiment. In fact, in Washington D.C., white people are more likely to be victims of hate crimes. That statistic about racially motivated hate crimes in 2013 came from this source: 'Latest Hate Crime Statistics Report Released.' FBI, FBI, 8 Dec. 2014, www.fbi.gov/news/stories/latest-hate-crime-statistics-report-released. That statistic about white people being more likely to be victims of racially motivated hate crimes in Washington D.C. came from this source: Noble, Andrea. '\textbf{Race}-Based Hate Crimes \textbf{Spike} in D.C.; Whites Most \textbf{Common} Victims, but Underreporting Feared.' The Washington Times, The Washington Times, 19 Aug. 2014, www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/19/\textbf{race}-based-hate-crimes-\textbf{spike}-in-dc/.Where do you get off claiming that a hate crime against a white person, that is motivated by \textbf{race}, does not count as \textbf{racism}, because it isn't being perpetrated by some powerful institution? Walking hand in hand with that point, not all white people are part of a powerful institution. Therefore, even if institutionality were a prerequisite for counting as \textbf{racism}, that would still mean that not all white people are capable of being \textbf{racist}. Some non-white people are parts of powerful institutions. Therefore, a non-white person who is part of a powerful institution, according to the logic of the power structures argument, can be \textbf{racist} toward a less powerful white person.  Weather or not the discrimination occurring is \textbf{common} makes no difference to the person experiencing it and it definitely does not make his or her plight less worthy of consideration. If you hate someone because of his or her \textbf{race} and you express that hatred by committing a crime against him or her, you are making him or her a victim. They are not any less of a victim because someone else has it worse. Equality is not a \textbf{zero} sum game. You cannot give justice to one group of people at the expense of another and call it equality. The flaw in that logic can be summed up in one sentence. Two wrongs do not make a right, especially when the second wrong hurts someone who was not even responsible for the first wrong. The Oppression Olympics, where you try to claim that you having it worse than someone else means that that someone else is less of a victim is just ridiculous. There are a lot of children in third world countries who have it 100 times worse than you could ever imagine. If my plight is less worthy of consideration, because you have it worse, than the millions of people in third world countries who have it way worse than you means that your plight is literally not worthy of consideration at all.  The logic of the power structures argument makes no sense. The logic of the power structures argument literally says 'Because thing X happens to group A more frequently than it happens to group B, it magically ceases to be thing X if and when it happens to group B.' That is not a straw man argument, that is literally exactly what the argument says. That logic could literally be used to argue that correcting a \textbf{black} person's grammar is \textbf{racist}, but the \textbf{Black} Panther Party spree killing white babies is not. If you can use this logic to claim an arbitrary definition of what actually counts as \textbf{racism}, then that same logic could be used to arbitrarily redefine just about anything. Imagine that a white man tresspasses on private property and, without even giving him a warning, a police officer, who is also a white male, pulls out his pistol and fires six shots at the trespasser, killing him in cold blood. By your logic, this situation does not count as police brutality, because \textbf{black} people are more likely to be victims of police brutality than white people. No one would be stupid enough to use that logic. At least I hope no one would. Imagine that a \textbf{woman} died in combat and you honored her sacrifice by calling her death a combat fatality. Now imagine that I said 'Actually that is not a combat fatality. It was a war death. What she did was an act of heroism. I absolutely agree that she is a hero. However, a combat fatality is when a person whose \textbf{gender} accounts for the majority of war deaths dies in war. Since men account for 97 of all war deaths, this was not a combat fatality.' If I said that, you would look at me like I have 15 heads. However, that is literally the logic that SJWs are using when they claim an ad hoc definition of \textbf{racism}. That statistic about men accounting for 97 of all combat fatalities came from this source:   [LINK]    This argument is a double edged sword. If you admit that \textbf{racism} must be institutionalized in order to count as \textbf{racism}, then by your own logic, it does not count as \textbf{racism} if you hang a Confederate flag in your backyard, since you are not exercising institutional power. Does it count as \textbf{racism} when a white man yells at a \textbf{black} \textbf{woman} walking down the street and calls her the 'N' word. If so, why? It is not being exercised by some powerful institution. Not only that, but the power structures argument is a tacit admission that affirmative action quotas are \textbf{racist}. Would you honestly argue that a homeless white man is more privileged than Lebron James, because other white people are better off than other \textbf{black} people? The claim that being white automatically equals privileged and being \textbf{black} automatically equals oppressed is itself \textbf{racist}, as it is predicated on the inability to look past a person's skin color. It is looking at a person's most superficial attributes and defining that person based on those snap judgements. I have a question for anyone who believes the power structures argument. Is it \textbf{racist} if an \textbf{black} \textbf{woman} yells at an Asian \textbf{woman} and claims to hate all Asians? Either way you answer this question, you admit that the power structures argument makes no sense. If you say yes, that is a tacit admission that being of a \textbf{race} of people who have the majority of this country's institutional power is not a prerequisite for being \textbf{racist}. If you say no, you are trivializing an injustice experienced by a \textbf{woman} of color and basically admitting that you aren't concerned in the slightest with standing up for oppressed minorities.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Institutional \textbf{racism} exists. But reverse \textbf{racism} doesn't exist, youre right. Because its just \textbf{racism}. You cant change the innate principle of \textbf{racism} based on demographic majority. Its still \textbf{racism}. How convenient for a \textbf{black} \textbf{woman} to say she cant be \textbf{racist}. I do sociology. The dictionary was invented in my city, Lichfield, England. It offers definitions. And its also improtant to recognise, different disciplines offer different definitions. A scoiologist uses the word "validity" different to other. The Subjects of Art and Science still disagree on what the Primary colours are. So you can objectively say \textbf{racism} towards white people doesnt exist even if white people are the majority. Youre using the definition from one school of thought. Sociology was not handed to us on a golden plate when the earth was created. Its not an objective truth. People still debate whether its a humanity or science. So next time, evaluate your statements and maybe you will get more respect from other educated people. So how did sociology decide \textbf{racism} is based on power and privilage? Do you even know? Also, on your premise, i would like to point out that if majority bodies cant experience \textbf{racism}, does the same apply for \textbf{sexism}? There are more females in the UK than men, does that mean i as a man cant be sexist because im in the minority? Of course it doesnt. So dont be so ignorant as to call things objective.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Assuming the stats are correct (and honest under the context), I think the ideas in this vid are pretty solid, and this girl seems genuinely well-intentioned. My only real problem here is that playing semantics with the term "\textbf{racist}" is potentially dangerous. People have a habit of jumping to conclusions (too often, the worst case scenario), so if I do something deemed "\textbf{racist}", it's unlikely people will ponder where it falls on the spectrum before judging my character. As a white conservative, it's clear that institutional \textbf{racism} against blacks abides (if even on a small scale), and Americans should do what we can to solve that problem.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small WOW! Where do I even begin?Sociology doesn't say that at all and I studied sociology.The real definition from sociology : The prejudice, discrimination or intolerance based on \textbf{race}.  AND THIS DEFINITION IS NOT SIMPLE! The fact is, you can't even understand the 3 words used for this definition otherwise you would suddenly understand YOU ARE \textbf{RACIST}! What you say is not the definition of sociology but mostly part of the current \textbf{black} society. There is a big difference. You first clue should have been that power is subjective.Mocking, ignoring the definition, doesn't make any difference you just changed the definition to suit your need of not be \textbf{racist}. As for your exampleYou don't ask a mechanic to know what a car is, you look at the dictionary. And you can ask an engineer to know how it works they are the one who designed them not mechanics.============================You are not even conscious that you are \textbf{RACIST}. As you said, and I quote "It's not just conscious hatred or dislike".So the issue acknowledging you are \textbf{RACIST}, but you don't want to acknowledge it.============================\textbf{Race} is not social construct it's genetics. You \textbf{race} have a DNA test and it will match the visual markers of \textbf{race}. PLEASE STOP DELUDING YOURSELF!Money is not a social construct it's trading method society has \textbf{nothing} to do with that. TRADING exist since long before money did! We just created a way to facilitate the trading. You can still barter as Oh so many people still do!HAHA! Treating  people differently based on \textbf{race} is the problem, but that means everything you previously said is WRONG!Racial prejudice! Racial prejudice is the definition of \textbf{RACISM}, read it! Prejudice based on \textbf{race}.If some \textbf{black} people have trouble getting loans, there is a reason. Loan is not based on \textbf{race}, it's based on revenue.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Racism refers to a variety of practices, beliefs, social relations, and phenomena that work to reproduce a racial hierarchy and social structure that yield superiority, power, and privilege for some, and discrimination and oppression for others. It can take several forms, including representational, ideological, discursive, interactional, institutional, structural, and systemic.\textbf{Racism} exists when ideas and assumptions about racial categories are used to justify and reproduce a racial hierarchy and racially structured society that unjustly limits access to resources, rights, and privileges on the basis of \textbf{race}. \textbf{Racism} also occurs when this kind of unjust social structure is produced by the failure to account for \textbf{race} and its historical and contemporary roles in society.Contrary to a dictionary definition, \textbf{racism}, as defined based on social science research and theory, is about much more than \textbf{race}-based prejudice — it exists when an imbalance in power and social status is generated by how we understand and act upon \textbf{race}.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I believe the minds behind this show are trying to reinstate segregation, let me explain:What does a \textbf{racist} want? A \textbf{racist} wants to keep people of different races separated.But a \textbf{racist} can't refuse service to someone based on their skin color, so how do they accomplish this?It's been said that the best way to get someone to do something for you is to convince them that it was their idea. Parents often use this psychological tactic to manipulate their children into behaving themselves, but how does this apply to a \textbf{racist}?Well, let's look at a pretend rich white \textbf{racist} for a moment. We'll call him Bill:Bill owns a broadcasting company that owns several popular television channels and internet news outlets. Bill wants to use these assets to further his goal of separating people by \textbf{race}, but he can't just put his \textbf{racist} propaganda on the air, because the backlash would be huge, rallying people of all races against his cause.So what does Bill do?Well, Bill hires people who are of the \textbf{race} that he wants to segregate, because they will be trusted by those races, seen as people they can relate to. Bill makes sure to green-light programs that talk about how ignorant, selfish, and untrustworthy white people are, so that people who believe these messages will want to avoid white people, because, let's face it, \textbf{nobody} wants to live near ignorant, selfish, untrustworthy people.And so, by putting anti-white messages onto popular websites and television channels, Bill gets his wish of segregation, because minorities who believe this propaganda don't want to move in next door to some untrustworthy, \textbf{racist}, ignorant white person.As a bonus, Bill also gets to laugh as minorities suffer in poverty, because they believe that no white person will give them a job, and no white person will help them in any way if they need it. Bill watches as minorities segregate themselves, all the while believing that it's because it was their idea.It isn't their idea, it's Bill's, and Bill is winning.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nobody, Race, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}10/346 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.89 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small How not-self aware can you be Frencesca? OK, I understand that you have good intentions, but your videos are completely misguided. Do me a favour and go check out some of the titles of your videos. All you do is talk about \textbf{race}. The more you talk about \textbf{racism}, the bigger problem it becomes. Especially your claims that PC culture isn't destroying freedom of speech are entirely idiotic. Freedom of Speech means that you can say anything you want, as long as it doesn't put people's lives in danger. Absolutely anything you want. Even if it is sexist or \textbf{racist} or ableist.I'm not saying that it is right to say such things, but the notion of free speech is that  you can say it. Whatever you say, someone is going to be offended. You can't protect everyone's "feelings".  Which is exactly what you did in this video. Any white person might react to your videos in two different ways. They will either feel extremely bad for being white or they will not buy any of your \textbf{racist} words. And any sane person will just disagree. I am not trying to be mean to you, because I know you mean well, but girl trust me your are mistaken about this. Everyone tells you so.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small racism itself really doesn't have much to do with the concept of privilege and the oppressor-victim dichotomy that is frequently discussed in leftist circles.  When we pretend that only majority groups can be \textbf{racist} and \textbf{ethnic} minorities cannot, we're creating a deep double standard. For example, in Canada, white people are the majority. If all whites are \textbf{racist} but minorities can never be \textbf{racist}, aren't we holding white people to a far stricter standard? Aren't we acting as though white people are inferior because they all have \textbf{racism} inherent in their consciousness? Because that sounds a lot like \textbf{racism} to me.We are told we can't have a voice on certain issues, because we can never understand or even imagine what it's like to be a racial minority. We are told we benefit from this vague, abstract concept of white privilege, just because we worked hard to be successful. We are told that we are to blame for past injustices such as colonialism, assimilation, and slavery.My point here is not at all to say that white people are victims and facing all kinds of discrimination, nor is it to say that \textbf{black} people, Asians, Arabs, and others are \textbf{racist} oppressors. I actually believe I live in a society that values a person's character more than the colour of their skin — and I want it to stay that way! Making sweeping generalizations about all white people, accusing us of being \textbf{racist} and oppressive solely based on our \textbf{race}, silencing us, and mocking us is \textbf{racism}, pure and simple.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small This helped me understand a little bit more .But I'm still confused on why a white person practicing racial prejudice to a person of color (not just \textbf{black} people)  is considered \textbf{racist}, but when a person of color does the same thing to a white person it is just simply racial prejudice not \textbf{racism}. Your point is coming off that \textbf{racism} is more towards a group as a whole in Society but how can when you have this example. Also u show that u believe whites do have more power in the country of America because whites are the majority of the population so we can be \textbf{racist} but if a white person goes to an Asian country (or a country with the majority population being people of color) and makes racial prejudice statement does that mean white aren't being \textbf{racist} because whites don't have the power in that country and don't take up the majority of the country?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Lmao no. If you genuinely believe that your \textbf{race} is superior, that is NEVER only prejudice, because being prejudice just means that you make ignorant assumptions and often subconsciously ('pre judge').

And that's all that you need to be \textbf{racist}. Power + prejudice is required to be SYSTEMATICALLY \textbf{racist} specifically, which you can't be towards white people.

I get a panic attack every time I see a police car behind me, even though I was never pulled over randomly without a reason. And I am white, and in a country where the policemen have much more restrictions than US policemen. (Poland) Why am I afraid? Because I have heard enough about how terrible the policemen in my country are. My experience directly contradicts that narration, but I still panic.And as a side note, I have heard only a few cases in the entire country in the past years about policemen abusing authority. Why do people then think it happens all the time? Because there was a time when it did happen all the time, and the narration was passed down from the times when it was accurate to times when it's not any more.There are from time to time cases of police brutality, in both countries. But what I found is that in Poland every now and then there are cases of police brutality on the news and after further investigation you find that most of them are accurate, others are exaggerated (policeman justifiably uses rubber bullets, some really unfortunate guy actually dies from it, "Policeman killed a young man in cold blood").In the US however, most cases are actually justified (Michael Brown), or exaggerated by the news, I remember only one or two cases when a \textbf{black} man was actually shot for no reason at all.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!27}1/256 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.391 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Here's the thing...the dictionary defines \textbf{racism} on an individual level, sociology is defining societal or "institutionalized" \textbf{racism} (that's the "prejudice + power" equation you mentioned). Institutionalized \textbf{racism} is a coherent and concerted form of individual \textbf{racism}.  The former cannot survive without the latter, but crucially not the other way around.  This is what I call a "house of cards argument" it seems like it could be legit if you're not paying attention.  But upon slight examination it falls apart.  Also when you have to use props in an argument it's never a good sign. Now 1 you're describing racial bias not \textbf{racism}. 2 I agree with you 3 I agree with you.  4 I would refer you to my first statement. Btw "racial prejudice" is \textbf{racism}. "\textbf{Racism}" is a form of prejudice \textbf{hun}, just like is \textbf{sexism} is a form of prejudice. You're talking about a less specific form of the same thing. Smoke and mirrors.

But apparently white people do. It's like saying \textbf{racism} is no longer considered by intent, it's just that white people are \textbf{racist} and don't know it. If you can't catch someone being \textbf{racist}, it's okay.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small She is misusing and politicizing intellectual information. The definition of \textbf{racism} she is using is called the "sociological perspective of \textbf{racism}." Within different forms of scholarship, definitions are often rewritten for the purpose of studying it from the perspective of that form of study. Sociologists study society. Because \textbf{racism} against a white person has no overarching effect on society, it is necessary that when talking about \textbf{racism} as a sociologist, you must only be talking about \textbf{racism} at a societal level. This however does not mean that \textbf{racism} doesn't happen or isn't \textbf{racism} at other levels. It just means it doesn't have a measurable effect on the overall function of the structure. Other disciplines have similar terms that are defined specifically to discuss a topic from the perspective of that discipline. But sorry Franchesca, that isn't how that works.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The key flaw in this lady's argument - the dictionary offers a definition of the word \textbf{racism}, sociology explains how people act in \textbf{racist} ways. These are two different things. Let's stick with her car analogy. The dictionary defines a car as "a road vehicle, typically with four wheels, powered by an internal combustion engine and able to carry a small number of people" - but if we want to understand how a car works we talk to a mechanic. This is all true, but the key point is, that if something corresponds with the dictionary's definition of a car we must call it a car, thus, something that corresponds with the dictionary's definition of \textbf{racism} is called and must be called \textbf{racism}.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Prejudice and \textbf{racism} ARE the same thing. \textbf{Racism} isn't power + prejudice, it's judging someone based on their \textbf{race}. Simple as that. There's \textbf{nothing} complicated about it, and power has \textbf{nothing} to do with it. If you judge someone based on the color of their skin, their \textbf{nationality}, or where they came from, it's \textbf{racist}. That includes \textbf{racism} against white people. Yet somehow it's okay for \textbf{black} people or other minorities to judge white people BECAUSE THEY ARE WHITE. Of course, it would be unthinkable for it to go the other way. It's like how some \textbf{black} student unions demanded \textbf{black} only dorms because they didn't want to have white people for roommates. Now, if that was switched and if people demanded white only dorms, people would get incredibly offended. And they would have the right to, because that's \textbf{racist}. No matter what \textbf{ethnicity} you come from, \textbf{black}, white, Asian, Muslim, or any other of the many minorities, you can be \textbf{racist}. And people can be \textbf{racist} against you. Always treat others as you want to be treated, and everyone should always be treated equally. Being a minority gives you no right to make \textbf{racist} comments against white people or other minorities and have it waved off as "oh, they can't be \textbf{racist}, they're \textbf{black}." It shouldn't work like that. No one should judge based in \textbf{race} or skin color. I'm not saying that there aren't \textbf{racist} white people, of course there are, but that doesn't mean members of minorities cant be and don't act \textbf{racist} too?

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Boy do I miss the \textbf{old} MTV. They used to play my Missy Elliot jams n' shit. Now they broadcast this \textbf{pussy} shit.Anyway, here is my opinion on this.. Not that anyone asked. On the contrary to what you are preaching, Franny, I know that some \textbf{black} people can and are more \textbf{racist} to white people now than ever before. Some of them feel that they are getting some kind of revenge we as individuals were not involved in. If someone was \textbf{racist} to you, there is no reason to be \textbf{racist} back. Put out the fire and stop igniting it by "getting back" at them. Some people are just \textbf{racist}, no matter what \textbf{race}. And they can be stuck in their ways. But that doesnt mean you get to generalize that group of people that person identifies with. Not all white people are \textbf{racist}. Hell, even some white people say that all white people are \textbf{racist}. Its very simple-minded to think that. You cant just make an assumption about a whole group of people just because one person was rude to you. You're right, we cant just ignore races. But by identifying people by their names and who they are as a person, we get one step closer to exterminating \textbf{racism}. I just feel like some people like to play victim and complain about life and being oppressed. But that is no way to live.. If you are scared of everything and everybody, you never meet these wonderful people along the way and see these places and different cultures. Speaking of culture... I think that if people celebrate other people's cultures, it is a good thing and a learnig experience. I know someone who is dating a latina and they are white. They share each others' culture and they both learn from each other this way. Its a beautiful thing when different people can come together and share their history with each other. We dont have to dwell in the bad times.Sorry, I was a bit everywhere.. I guess dont take this too hard. This modern society is just so sensitive and paranoid.

Technically there are races of human but because of past usage of this, there is a global consensus (more or less) to not use the \textbf{race} labels on humans. The "\textbf{race}" label/category is a problematic one even regarding other animals nowadays as biology have problems with their categorization because of the introduction of DNA rather than judging by expertise, region and other factors (as most of the name/labels came before).

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Your argument is horrible. The fact that you think \textbf{racism} can only be done by whites is absurd, ABSURD. Here is where you are wrong:1. You mentioned that people of color can be racially prejudice, but not \textbf{racist} because they are not backed up by any institutuon (the don't have power essentially) to do anything about their feelings. People of color can definitely be in and are in positions of power, unless Obama (our president for the past 8 years) has a really bad \textbf{tan}. To add on, you said there is no one to back it up for them making to make it okay, but when whites are \textbf{racist} there is. That is not only implying that its okay when white people are \textbf{racist}, but also that \textbf{racism} is okay in general which is \textbf{racist} and hypocritical.2. If you can only be \textbf{racist} if you have an institution backing you up, that means the KKK can not be \textbf{racist}. The KKK is not backed by any institution so can they not be \textbf{racist}? OF COURSE NOT. So that again proves that you do not need an institution backing you up for it to be \textbf{racism} and not racial prejudice.3. \textbf{Racism} according to the dictionary (not some BS that I made up to make my opinion seem more believable) is discrimination, prejudice, etc... done to another \textbf{race} based on the belief that your own \textbf{race} is superior. Meaning, if a person of color even believed that their \textbf{race} was superior to a white person's \textbf{race}, and the were prejudice towards whites that would therefore make them \textbf{racist}.4. The fact that you believe there aren't people of color in positions of power in institutions is nonsense. In my school I have an Asian principal, and a \textbf{black} vice-principal. If our principal expelled every white student from our school, based the the belief that her \textbf{race} is superior to whites, this would be a perfect example of a person of color in a position of power being \textbf{RACIST} to people of different races. Now, im not saying she did do that, but COULD she have done that? Absolutely! Proving that it might be rare that something like this is done, but it CAN be done. In other words meaning people of color CAN be \textbf{racist} to white people, but often are not.5. I have no hate intended towards you, you seem like a great person.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small What's funny is if someone was pretending to be \textbf{black}, this would be \textbf{racist}, yet trying to play out "white stereotypes" isn't? That sounds like hypocrisy.So, let's really dive into this:Sociology DOES NOT define \textbf{racism} as prejudice plus power. It sees \textbf{racism} as the basic idea: being prejudiced against someone of a different \textbf{race} as yours. That simple. Power or not. This "going a little deeper" seems to try to justify one \textbf{race} being \textbf{racist} over others....which is \textbf{racist} in itself. There are different types of \textbf{racism}, too...but the general idea has \textbf{nothing} to do with power. What I find funny is how this video tries to just look at institutional \textbf{racism} as some blanket term for all. It falls short of the truth.So, the idea that reverse \textbf{racism} not being a thing is true...sort of. It's just \textbf{racism} all the same. There's no "reverse" about it. It's \textbf{racism}, period. Oh, and racial prejudice IS \textbf{racism}. If you see someone of a different \textbf{race} as worse than you (or "wrong"), that's \textbf{racism}...PERIOD. And, it's rather \textbf{racist}, too, to try to justify (in a way) this prejudice by somehow overlooking the power that \textbf{black} people do have (and by trying to make some ignorant argument that \textbf{black} people somehow "can't" be \textbf{racist}). What I find really funny is that this video does a good job at implying that \textbf{racism} is something that only occurs against \textbf{black} people. \textbf{Racism} occurs, sadly, to all races. There are school districts who have not hired people based on them not being \textbf{black}. What would that be called? And, if \textbf{racism} is prejudice plus power, could a group of white people who have no power be \textbf{racist}? Or would that somehow exclude them from this definition?Let me say this: Prejudice (when it comes to \textbf{race}) and \textbf{racism} ARE the same thing.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Nothing, Race, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}29/309 & \cellcolor{green!27}9.385 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Sea Pea Dumbass.Today I'm going to tell you why the argument for that \textbf{black} people cant be \textbf{racist} is a myth. The most \textbf{common} argument is privlage plus power. Or the power structures argument. It is the notion that because that white people have not been oppressed back then society that they can be \textbf{racist} toward them.1: The SJW definitions which stipulate that \textbf{racism} and \textbf{sexism} must be systematic are not found in any dictionary.2: We are going to break down white privilege. White people do not have any edge in America in today's society and government. The reason that people think otherwise is because people want equality of outcome not equality of opportunity. We have equality of opportunity which means that \textbf{black} people can do as much as white people with out discrimination. But what people fail to understand is that if we had equality of outcome that would mean that we would have created a society that does not support work because you no matter how good you would do in the job you would not get more money so in turn you would not be incentivised to work harder. This has already been tried and it faild you might know it as \textbf{communist} Russia.Now for power. \textbf{Black} people can can be elected by the people to the highest office in the land twice in a row. For eight years. Now I dont know what that tells you other than \textbf{black} people can get into any powerful position in the world. But again this comes back to people wanting equality of outcome. The reason that white people hold more powerful positions it because there culture. Now this is vague so I will explain. Asian culture is centered around getting a college degree and getting a high paying job. But on the other side \textbf{black} people do the opposite they shun people who who want to learn. So before you come and attack white people because they hold positions that \textbf{black} people can get why dont you ask why are they not motivated to get to those positions.So now that we have broken down the fundamentals of the argument and disproved them I ask you why do you think that reverse \textbf{racism} is real.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Common, Communist, Racism, Racist, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}13/380 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.421 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Klo Not "BECAUSE".  They have political power "AND" they instill fear in their communities.  I didn't say one was the cause if the other.  Secondly, Members of the KKK are Judges, police officers and local officials.  They hold many positions in the community.   Your third point about the roles being switched just makes no sense.  Too many questions would have to be answered.  Like are \textbf{black} people the still minorities or are they now the dominate \textbf{race} in your scenario?  Are \textbf{black} people doing this for a moment or do they also have a hundred year history of doing this?  Cross burning is too tied to the identity of the KKK for us to hypothesize about another group acting like them.  So maybe you're asking if \textbf{black} people did something to instill fear in white people would they be \textbf{racist}?  If \textbf{black} people got mad and killed all the white people in their communities or threatened to kill them would they be \textbf{racist} and/or political power?

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I know not all, but many people think that it is simply not possible for a person of a majority \textbf{ethnicity} to suffer \textbf{racism}. I believe this to be wrong, and will explain why.I think that the reason why many think this is because of the definition of \textbf{racism} in sociology, referring to power and privilege, and so I can understand why the conclusion might be drawn that those of a minority group are likely to have less power than those of the majority.However the situation in which we find ourselves in modern western civilization is a little more complicated, for instance, if I were to stand outside with a sign which read something simple like '\textbf{Black} people are inferior to white people' I would (rightly) encounter wide spread disagreement. Who has the power in this situation, I am firmly in the minority. So no matter what my skin colour and the majority group it may belong to, I am in the minority. This is because of the ideology I am aligning myself to.My point is that \textbf{racism} just isn't tolerated in our society, people of all races rally against it, but when people say that a \textbf{black} person cannot be \textbf{racist} to a white person in a mainly white country they are indeed going to allow it to happen, and in fact are likely to be \textbf{racist} themselves.I would go to the dictionary definition to start with, \textbf{racism} is: prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different \textbf{race} based on the belief that one's own \textbf{race} is superior. And if we say that minority groups are indeed allowed to be prejudiced towards majority groups, because it's socially acceptable, then we are allowing \textbf{racism}.The fact is, white people really do not have any privilege any more, minority groups have won their equality, and rightly so, but now I am reminded of a quote from animal farm, George Orwell's famous anti \textbf{communist} allegory  "All animals are equal...but some animals are more equal than others".

Remember when those 'people of color' kidnapped a white couple, cut off there genitals, and stuffed them into 55 gallon drums because you know... they were being white... isn't \textbf{racist}?

This definition is based off society and we need to understand that we can't be all over the world trying see every moment that deals \textbf{racism}. \textbf{Race} is a social construct and it biologically does not exist. We were all born in Africa. We have skin pigmentation that creates a major substance called melanin and when we people started to migrate they their skin pigment changed. So, melanin is what gives us our skin tone and when other people started to explore different parts of the world they started to produce less of the substance melanin. \textbf{Race} is also based off the systematic oppression of people something that white people have never suffered in the American history books. Fact there are about or more than 2000 white judges in our judicial system while there is only about or more 200 \textbf{black} judges. Y'all need to go to school and educate yourselves and take a sociology class because we live in a society where their is social construct.

Even if you accept the that \textbf{racism} is contingent on power (in defiance of reason), POC, especially in America, are not without it. \textbf{Black} Americans for example are some of the most powerful and wealthy people who've ever lived. They have American privilege, they share in the wealth of the most prosperous \textbf{nation} that's ever existed. They enjoy comforts that whites born in the US only 100 years ago could hardly imagine. They hold positions of power and influence in every level of government and finance, including the single highest seat in the \textbf{nation}. The only explicitly \textbf{racist} institutions that I'm aware of intentionally benefit blacks and other POC over whites and Asians. POC in the US have the power to enact their \textbf{racism}, and sadly, like whites, many of them exorcise that power every day, often with tragic effect. This fashionable academic redefinition of \textbf{racism} which takes great pains to exclude all but whites from accountability for its personal expression, is irresponsible.

Right now we're facing this \textbf{black} vs white problem and if we start treating each other as humans instead of \textbf{black} vs white, \textbf{racism} would be on the decline. We should stop treating other differently (in both directions, blacks stop treating whites differently​ \& vice versa). But don't get me wrong. This is no easy task. African-Americans have been segregated from whites since forever. In that time, African-Americans turned to the only thing they had, each other.Only in the 1960's did we see this segregation start to end, but the sense of community and a \textbf{common} culture of African-Americans continued to persist. And who can blame them? You can't just ask a culture to end over night because "legally \textbf{racism} isn't allowed to exist anymore." Personally, I believe it's an "us vs them" mentality that can only end with time. We should focus less on \textbf{race} like African-American, European/White-American, Native-American, Asian-American and focus more on what all really are: American. It will only come with time, but we shouldn't encourage segregation. Calling every white person \textbf{racist} isn't gonna help that.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Common, Race, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}7/193 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.627 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small BXSTXRD: The thing is what you guys are doing isn't fixing the problem at all. \textbf{Racism} most certanly exist and it exist among all races. What MTV has done is make everything that doesn't work out for a \textbf{black} person be, because of \textbf{racism}. If a \textbf{black} person gets fired, doesn't get the job they applied for, or gets denied entry into the college they applied for its because of \textbf{racist} in their books. If we try to point out that the majority of gang members are \textbf{black}, that the majority of crimes committed are committed by \textbf{black} people, that majority of single mothers in the country are \textbf{black}, that the majority of people on welfare in the country are \textbf{black}, that the majority of kids who flunk out of high school is \textbf{black}. We are called \textbf{racist}. Do you see the issue here? I will admit that a lot of these issues are the result of the government pumping large amounts of drugs into the \textbf{black} communities but than you guys chose to feed into their shit by continuing to vote for the people who put you guys into this situation in the first place. When the Japanese were brought into Hawaii to work on the plantations they had to live in horrible conditions were paid next to \textbf{nothing} and were essentially slaves. Instead of complaining about it they banded together as a community, they focused on educating each other, helping each other build businesses and only shopped at Japanese owned businesses. Because of this the vast majority of the wealthy families and politicians in Hawaii now, are Japanese. The \textbf{black} community as a whole needs to stop complaining about shit that happened in the past and need to work together to fix their own problems because the knight and savior is never going to come. you need to encourage your youth to stay in school and study, you need to teach your youth that being on welfare is not something to brag about and be proud of, you need to encourage your young \textbf{black} men to treat \textbf{woman} with respect and to take responsibility the life they helped create, you need to ban together a demand gangs be disbanded and kick them out of your communities, you need to actually do research into the candidates you vote for in your local communities, you need to stop asking for more assistance programs that are designed to keep you dependent on these programs.

I work at a school, and I am a white male (that seems to be the equivalent of me being the scum of the earth, but bare with me). I have absolutely no bias towards any child, unless that child specifically has a REPEATABLE HISTORY of doing things that are obviously against school policy, and even then, I, and my coworkers, only become more weary of these SPECIFIC children and their INDIVIDUAL actions. I personally like to judge people based on the content of their character instead of looking at commonalities, such as skin color, and blindly following these statistics as fact, purely at face-value. I also cannot tell you how often I have encountered white children facing many of the same problems that many children of other ethnicities also face; broken families (sometimes with a history of drug abuse in the family) or otherwise-impovershed homes. Systemic \textbf{racism} is a farce, and you're inadvertently \textbf{racist} by any metric that one could use to determine such a thing.

This is a disgraceful channel, and anyone using the name MTV, which once celebrated and embraced diversity, to promote this CLEARLY \textbf{racist} nonsense, ought to be completely ashamed and embarrassed.  Good luck with your delusions.  If you ever come down from your high, we can talk about \textbf{black} people getting help for college due to the United \textbf{Negro} College Fund, grants for skin color, lower test scores than whites and Asians for acceptance, affirmative action to nearly guarantee the graduate a job, and the NAACP to defend them if denied said job, even if it's due to someone else, white or otherwise, essentially non \textbf{black}, having more experience and better qualifications.  These are specific examples of racial privilege, a term these idiots so often speak but never dig deeper into because there is no white equivalent of these things.  Kinda like when people said that BET was invented because every other channel was White Entertainment Television up until then, yet they have no answer for why there were countless \textbf{black} people on TV in baseball, basketball, and football, all the while completely forgetting about Sanford and Son, The Jeffersons, Good Times, The Cosby Show, Family Matters, A Different World, Moesha, The Fresh Prince of Bel Air, The Jamie Foxx Show, The Damon Wayans Show, The Steve Harvey Show, Hangin' With Mr. Cooper, Martin, In Living Color, Living Single, not to mention \textbf{black} game show contestants, news anchors, meteorologists, Montel Williams, Oprah Winfrey.  And because \textbf{black} people are such a small percentage of the population and an even smaller percentage of Hollywood, it is natural and consistent that there would be more "white" shows.  Now if there were a WET channel, not just because it allegedly shows no \textbf{black} people anywhere but also was truly called White Television and held an annual White Entertainment Awards show, it would actually be an example of \textbf{racism} that Franchesca and her ilk could use.  But they know they can't because \textbf{black} people have powerful organizations specific to their skin color.  \textbf{Black} side characters, main characters, athletes, musicians, and \textbf{black}-themed shows were never excluded from getting air time on so-called white TV prior to BET.   Apparently, affirmative action, United \textbf{Negro} College Fund, the George Washington Carver Scholarship, the National Achievement Scholarship, and the NAACP are just more proof that \textbf{whitey} is holding the \textbf{black} man down worse than ever.  If anything, all of these organizations show that \textbf{black} people should be held to a lower standard, which is possibly a reason why they don't hold themselves to a higher standard of accountability as far as fatherhood, child support, employment, and being generally law-abiding citizens.  People like Franchesca will say that it's white people's fault, even though there are no institutions, no forgiveness of shitty test scores, no guarantees of employment simply because of white skin, no evidence at all to back the claim that oppressive whites have them by the balls.  I'm not saying \textbf{racism} is totally dead, but until these human turds at MTV or buzzfeed can name one single law, a single organization or scholarship or a single place of employment that can guarantee certain benefits because of white skin, under penalty of possible litigation if denied, then we can talk about how to fix it.  Until then, quit showing \textbf{old} pictures of slaves or the Jim Crowe South to prove points because even if you want to blame those historical eras for today's problems, it is worth noting that any laws associated with them have been abolished for many, many decades and have since been replaced with helping hands.  If I missed some specific part of 21st century \textbf{black} oppression that cannot be faced by whites or any other \textbf{race}, please fill me in.   And please, I don't mean Dylan Roof. What he did was wrong and inexcusable, but how many Dylan Roofs are out there doing similar things daily, weekly, monthly, even yearly?  Haven't heard of anyone since.  Can't name a person before him who did something similar.  Perhaps that's because he was a lone nutcase, the minority, not the majority, the lawbreaker, not the lawmaker, the exception, not the rule.  What happened, MTV?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small + V LI I am not denying that slavery was evil. It was horrible. But slavery is over now. I am not automatically \textbf{racist} because white people owned slaves. In fact, fewer than 5 of Americans today are descended from slave owners. My family came from Ireland, so it is entirely possible that my ancestors were slaves. My family never owned slaves.Your thinking is the same thinking that lead Jean Baptiste Lamarck to believe in his disproven theory of acquired characteristics. Yes, \textbf{racist} white people do exist. There are too many of them. There are also too  many \textbf{racist} \textbf{black} people, like possibly yourself. There are too many of those too.I also do not need to pay for the slave owner's wrongdoing. If my father committed a crime, then died before he could serve his sentence, I would not be expected to serve his sentence. That is not how it works. So if you are going to argue that blacks are oppressed, at least cite some bullshit statistic that applies to the present day. Everyone knows that slavery happened. \textbf{Nobody} here is denying that. You were never a slave, I was never a slave owner. If I am biased against you, it is not because of your \textbf{race}.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small +Cubemaster what Imam  is trying to say that blacks make  only 12 of the USA population and are getting shot at an alarming rate by the police compared to their white counterparts.  So statistically speaking the numbers will show that more whites are shot by police but only because as a whole they make up a huge percentage of the population. If you were to compare the ratio between population and brutality you would see what she was talking about. And this is why many white people have the stereotype of being ignorant towards \textbf{race}, because most of the time \textbf{nobody} really listens. You can't look at a number and build a fact on that.And to the whole \textbf{racism} thing,  \textbf{black} people can be racially biased (prefer certain races over others)  or racially prejudiced (believe certain things about specific races).  People say they cannot be \textbf{racist} because sociologically speaking \textbf{racism} is a construct of oppression by \textbf{race}. \textbf{Racism} as we know it today is oppression. In order to oppress you need to have power. And since the white \textbf{race} has effectively colonized and invaded most parts of the world (that is why they're more developed,  not because they're white but because they invaded countries and took their mineral resources to enrich themselves and left the countries in poverty), the system is built around the white \textbf{race},  so racial prejudice and bias by a white person is able to oppress a person of color, but not the other way around. It's important to consider history as \textbf{racism} is a historical concept. And the reason why people never consider the Irish slaves is because it has no bearing on how Irish people are treated today. Irish people are not oppressed because they were slaves. They're just like every other white European and the system still benefits them. That's why \textbf{black} enslavement is relevant, but white enslavement is considered irrelevant.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Nobody, Race, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}12/318 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.774 \\  \hline

I'm autistic and I'm not even allowed to go to public school.In first grade I was seen as an easy target so I got beaten EVERY SINGLE day. You saying "ooh yeah you got beaten but listen to me I'm a self judged victim" is extremely inappropriate for actual victims. Blacks can be in the military, I can't. Blacks can go to all kinds of school, I can only go to the special needs classes, where I don't even get taught anything. I spent 4 years of my childhood life trying to get back to public school, after 6 months on a public school I got a new teacher and apparently I was "too autistic", \textbf{nothing} made me different from my peers, she just didn't like me, she even complained about my language being too \textbf{old}, so I got kicked out. Autistic people are stereotyped a lot and that's why we have a terrible social life. When you first have autism it's a lot easier to get numerous other \textbf{mental} illnesses, people who constantly wants attention (like you) pretends to have these \textbf{mental} illnesses and it only makes us with the actual disorder not being believed or taking serious. It's very rare an autistic person can even get a job, none of the autistic persons I know have had job, and that's awful.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Hey Franchesca, not a bad video, but let's break this down. First of all, there is a key distinction between \textbf{racism} and more specifically racial discrimination, which is actually what you made your video on, but then escalated the concept slightly erroneously by equating it to \textbf{racism} as a whole. What you're talking about in this video is not what \textbf{racism} is in its essence, you're talking about something much more specific -- racial discrimination. What you're saying is completely valid, but it means that due to the power structure, blacks, in most cases, do not have the power to discriminate against other races like whites or even asians do in the US. The vast majority of employers and business owners in our country are white, with asians in 2nd, and therefore there is a far, far better chance of being discriminated against by someone who is white than there is from any other \textbf{race}, that's just the truth. It happens all of the time and that's what you're actually talking about when you brought up the institution we're living in.Now if we are looking at the bigger picture of what being \textbf{racist} entails, ALL people have the ability to be \textbf{racist}. \textbf{Racism} means generalizing people due to a skin color, it happens in someone's mind, figuratively in someone's heart, and it is let out through their speech or their actions. Economic power, institutional power, or any type of ability to use discrimination involving a business, workplace position, school, realty property etc. that any given person influences or has some level of control over is not a requirement for a person to be a \textbf{racist} or to say \textbf{racist} things or think \textbf{racist} thoughts. This is simply what being \textbf{racist} is, and the institution is where racial prejudice and racial discrimination come into play, which is where your point stands and has a great deal of validity. However, this is not what \textbf{racism} is exclusive to.Anyone, of any color has the ability to be \textbf{racist}. Not everyone has an ability to actively discriminate against people from something due to another's skin color.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Race, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}13/354 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.672 \\  \hline

(\textbf{black} president?)Many of the arguments here are very tired but I do appreciate the point. One thing I will say is sociology is a bit of a joke haha. many "studies" do not hold up to repeatabillity - the data is real for sure but the conclusions are false. Possibly not in every case mind you - for the mechanic example you're asking a tire shop to work on your engine, they may have knowledge of engines but they don't know what they're doing for that and are not properly equipped.  I wouldn't agree that \textbf{racism} requires institutional power - or I would call it systemic \textbf{racism}. I think \textbf{black} power or white power is equally \textbf{racist} and not sure how that could be denied. Discrimination on names and other things although are bad or logically fallacious but it is more understandable and not a shall we say "evil". People with big noses are discriminated against I do not think we need a national discussion - I don't think it's odd to not hire someone named Hamik somo Shamil - a big reason why someone wouldn't hire them is an assumption that they wouldn't fit in with the working environment - hiring someone who doesn't speak English very well can be detrimental to many firms and enterprises. Though a name does not necessarily mean anything, I wouldn't be outraged if Hamik Shamil's company didn't think Richard would fit in - it's something to work on but it is a subtle cultural problem, as long as there remains opportunity to grow. If you wanted me to take a chance on Hamik then you have to deregulate the rights of employees. If Hamik was a contractor and had good references on his work and the price was right - no problem.It is important to note that discriminatory assumptions has been and is currently dissolving at a very steady pace. \textbf{Racism} is relocated to very small pockets of society and even than it's not as intense and overt as it once was - the KKK for instance on a general level admits to fallacious reasoning which is also an admission of complete ignorance. Other \textbf{racism} in groups like  BLM has started to climb but I think it's temporary, the general populace is smart enough to see bad reasoning once their emotions calm down. Systemic \textbf{racism} in North America appears to be completely eradicated if not very incredibly small examples in which the system has laws and regulations in place to deal with this directly (although some I think are a little discriminatory against whites and some others I can tolerate that prejudice in the name of good progress)\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}14/517 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.708 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small As a linguist, I'd say we are justified in ignoring the dictionary here. Dictionary semantics is about reducing usage down to the smallest number of necessary and sufficient features, but linguistic terms and categories do not always develop around necessary and sufficient features, and for abstractions, they rarely ever develop that way. Additionally, dictionaries don't adjudicate meaning, they just try hard to keep up with it. Their treatment of "\textbf{racism}" has been historically inaccurate, and in no small part because the people who have written and edited dictionaries have overwhelmingly been wealthy white people. "\textbf{Racism}" was historically used to refer to the oppression of a weaker class by a more powerful class. The first known usage refers to the US government's oppressive treatment of Native Americans, and that's actually the primary context for the term for many years. During the Civil Rights Movement, white people began to fight back against the movement by accusing \textbf{black} people of being prejudiced, but because \textbf{racism} was always about power against a lack of power, they invented the term "reverse \textbf{racism}." This referred to racial prejudice from less powerful groups against more powerful groups, but it was a laughable bit of rhetoric that has never gained much support anywhere. White people continue to seek to undermine equality by dismissing the highlighting of oppression as \textbf{racism} on the part of \textbf{black} people, but now they just use the term "\textbf{racism}" all by itself, insisting it refers generically to any racial prejudice. This not only helps to undercut the ways white people and institutions are prejudiced, but it also mitigates the seriousness of racial prejudice on the part of white people by tacitly insisting it is the equivalent of racial prejudice on the part of \textbf{black} people. \textbf{Black} people have for years highlighted this historical usage and expressed concern for a more accurate definition of the term, but they don't have the institutional power to effect that kind of change yet. Importantly, white people insisting \textbf{racism} is generic prejudice over and against the argument that it is about power is precisely an example of a more powerful group using their power to silence and marginalize the concerns and opinions of less powerful groups. In other words, it is the very definition of \textbf{racism}.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Racism & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}12/377 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.183 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small In My opinion, the only cure for \textbf{racism} is the non-existence of organizations like BLM - And \textbf{common} sense in life + healthy priorities according to your current individual and social situation. These people seem to have a higher risk of not having the luxuary of adiquate \textbf{common} sense in some areas due to low education, violent trends and gang-behaviour in their society. They are, apparently, more likely to develope destructive social tendence's, than the rest of the population - probably directly because of these trends. -There are many similar issues in all other societies/races, but the occurance of violence in the others is apparently less frequent. Spreading propaganda, and disrupting random people's lives like BLM is doing, is cancer to our society and it's existence is only making everything worse.Furthermore -Privelege is something you earn by showing that you are a civilized and reasonable person. Expecting privelege from anything else than your own accomplishments is stupid, and moaning over how you are perceived by other people, is just a stupid waste of everyone's time.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Your confusion is understandable. The first thing you have to understand is why this video is being made. (As a side note, I am not white. It shouldn't make a difference but I just wanted to put it out there.) Anyway, under the false pretense that she is trying to clarify this issue, she is actually trying convince you that you should redefine the definition of \textbf{racism}. Basically, the definition of \textbf{racism} is believing that one \textbf{race} is superior or inferior to another and the hate that comes from that belief. Every dictionary words it differently but that is basically it. You should look all them up. This is the definition you were probably taught in school, that is in every dictionary, and is how the average person on the street would define the word. What she has done is found a definition used by a small group of people and decided that this is what the word \textbf{racism} should mean. Conveniently, this definition excludes \textbf{black} people from being called \textbf{racist}. For example, if a \textbf{black} person born in America was to believe that \textbf{black} people are BORN smarter and more naturally virtuous than white people; and that white people are BORN less intelligent and are morally corrupt from conception than \textbf{black} people, under the definition that she wants you to adopt, that \textbf{black} person could not be called a \textbf{racist} because \textbf{black} people in America don't have political power. In summery, I believe that she is trying to redefine the word for political purposes and we should be very cautious when people change words to fit their political agenda. Words and labels are very powerful. We should use \textbf{racism} as defined by the dictionary and we should create a new word for prejudice + power.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Race, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}13/296 & \cellcolor{green!5}4.392 \\  \hline

Now let's say that "its impossible for \textbf{black} people to be \textbf{racist}" because they are a minority (only in America by the way) of around 13, being oppressed by whites in power. How does this logic apply to South Africa where blacks are the majority and have the power in government.

Only a handful of Western European nations took \textbf{African} slaves. Of those only a handful of people owned those slaves while most whites in countries like America suffered in having to compete with slave owners in Agrarian America.Hint American wealth is not a function of slavery. Its was built upon the industrial revolution not slavery. Again the international laws and funding for combating slavery comes from nations in the developed world. The vast majority of which did not practice slavery.Are Germans suppose to take responsibility for their wealth while working to end slavery given Germany never played a role in the practice??Lastly yes it matters that the world had slavery since civilization was born but only ONE culture on earth ended it on a global scale.

However, there are more white people in this country than there are \textbf{black} people. There is 1 \textbf{black} person to every 6 white people. So It makes sense that more white people are killed.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small A cop is there to keep everyone safe, not just white people, or middle aged asian women. And \textbf{black} people are more likely to engage because there is so much distrust between police and minorities. When you look at a cop, you see someone you trust to keep you safe, but when a \textbf{black} person sees a cop they feel the need to get defensive and pull out a camera for protection. Look, I'll be the first to admit that I love the police and my friend's mom is a cop, but I also see many injustices throughout the system. Such as racial profiling. If the same thing were to happen to white people there'd be an ever larger uproar. The only reason that these young \textbf{black} men commit these crimes is a sense of responsibility to their families and/or communities. And then there are those people that do it cause they can, but statistically, more \textbf{black} men commit these crimes out of necessity. Also, there is a lot of hate going around this topic.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Steve Jovan your argument that blacks are more likely to engage in behavior that leads to use of lethal force is also false.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Zachary Miller One you cite \textbf{nothing}!Hint Mapping Police Violence is not a scholarly citation! Do you even understand the difference?It's a online site that is dedicated to a political agenda. The fact you used this as a source is telling of what you don't know about research!Give your source and methodology!You can't as your source is not a primary one. Have you read one critique of this source? Just one?Secondly being armed is not the only measure of police response. If a 250lb \textbf{black} suspect is trying to take the gun of a 5'8 female police officer its grounds for a lethal response. What kind of idiotic people think that being armed is the sole measure of a threat to an officer. Hint long before guns existed people injured and even killed one another with their bare hands.Do you have training in any related field of study? Any?I'll get you started.One possible comparison group is murderers: According to the FBI, about half are \textbf{black}. Another is cop-killers, i.e., those who demonstrably presented a lethal threat to police: Again according to the FBI, about 43 percent are \textbf{black}. Still another is violent criminals in general: Most of these commit relatively minor offenses (such as simple assault, where there is no weapon or serious injury), but according to victimization surveys, about 24 percent are \textbf{black}. In other words, violent-crime rates roughly explain the gap — indeed, they over-explain it in the case of murderers and cop-killers, who are far more likely to be \textbf{black} than police-shooting victims are.In the future try looking at who used their weapon when confronted by police rather than who simply had a weapon. If it were the case that \textbf{black} armed \textbf{black} men were less likely to kill police then you might have the beginnings of a hypothesis but as the data shows \textbf{black} men armed or not kill police at a much higher rate than whites. Why then should anyone be surprised by the fact that police are more likely to kill \textbf{black} men given lethal force is exactly the response one expects when threatened by lethal intent.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!5}10/361 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.77 \\  \hline

Clearly you have not bothered to read any of these.This is why we teach epistemology. This is why we teach methodology in social sciences.I'll get you started!Take, for instance, a high-profile study released by Harvard University economist Roland G. Fryer Jr. and covered in The New York Times and many other media outlets. It found that police are no more likely to shoot a \textbf{black} suspect than a white suspect in encounters in which using deadly force could be deemed justified — such as when suspects attack officers or resist arrest. The implication: \textbf{Black} people are shot at a higher rate relative to their population simply because they have more high-risk encounters with officers.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!27}3/172 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.744 \\  \hline

To survive in that cold land called Europe. Lets call them Whites. Another group went east and adapted to living in Asia. Lets call them Asians. All of them are humans but there are definatey diffences between the races.Asians have more IQ than whites who have more IQ than Blacks on average. Blacks can jump higher and run faster than whites and Asians . Near to no asians winning the 100 meter sprint on the Olympics. Near to no \textbf{black} people become grand master in Chess. It's evolution. Second. Colorblindness is the end of \textbf{racism}. Do you treat a \textbf{y\textbf{e\textbf{llow}}} T-shirt differently than a blue T-shirt? I don't.

They suffered during the voyage from Africa during which they were transported as chattel - chained together and lying in their own excrement and vomit.  So many died.  Ca you not see how sick this is.  Holding on to this and/or diminishing this is THE HEIGHT OF EVIL.  Even animals were treated more humanly when they were transported.  The people who did this were whites.  They collectively participated in torture so that they could break the souls of millions of human being and USE THEM exploitatively.After the slave voyage, slaves were exposed to great trauma by being treated as less than beasts. and being gawked at when they were sold on auction blocks in public.After this they were subject to great violence and abuse.  The women were raped and abused in a vile and sinful way that could only be categorized as Satanic.  Slaves were subject to torment and torture - they were often beaten to death.  They were used in scientific experiments.After they were enfranchised - \textbf{Black} were subject to collective lynchings.  After or during the lynchings, their bodies were mutilated and their \textbf{sexual} organs were cut or ripped off.  women had their breast cut off and their vagina cut open as well as their bellies cut open.\textbf{Black} were prevented from participating in the work force and forced into job ghettos such as domestic or field labor.  They were trapped in exloitativ3e economic situation.  They were denied education.  Blacks have been traditionally trapped into ghettos and segregated from the rest of society.They are often not hired in favor of anyone else, as long as they are not \textbf{Black}.They are exposed to a process of criminalization where they are rather routinely caught up in police sweeps and put through "The system".As you have  seen in the news, \textbf{Black} youths and men are ROUTINELY SHOT DOWN in the streets extra-judicially.  This is what \textbf{racism} is all about.Being killed.  Being beaten, Being excluded.  Being hunted down.  Being denied participation in the riches and goods of a very wealthy \textbf{nation}.  Being denied civil protect.  Being devalued, mistrusted, suspected, followed. Being denied even basic civil rights.  Being labelled as dangerous, ugly, undesirable, violent.The problem with white racists is that whatever happens to \textbf{Black} people, no matter HOW BAD IT IS, they see it as perfectly acceptable normal.Has anyone ever noticed that any time a \textbf{Black} person cries out for justice - YOU RACISTS are so inherently sadistic that they call it WHINING.  Asking for better job opportunities - You say it's playing the \textbf{race} card.  Asking for better housing - it's asking for special privileges.  You racists are the vilest scum of the earth.

The study you are referring to was deemed incorrect about blacks getting more prison time and jail sentences for the same crimes because looking deeper into it when a \textbf{black} person was charged with time it was due to prior criminal offenses... do your research.. oh and white people were killed way more then \textbf{black} people by cops last year.. many of which was suspicious at best, one killed a child and one man was even naked and they shot and killed them.... no riots, no cities burning, some of the cops who killed white people were \textbf{black} and no \textbf{black} people were randomly beaten over it.. it's funny how you can pick and choose what is and isn't \textbf{racist} and what is and isn't OK and just because you say something doesn't make it true... minorities like blacks actually get jobs over a white person if they are equally qualified in order to diversify the work place and so they can't be called \textbf{racist} for having no blacks, other then that in my experience hiring ppl is probably because they were talking ibonics and improper English for a job that involved talking to clients and typing... were dressed inappropriately even when told what to wear, or just were not qualified at all and finally sometimes other people just did a better job in the interview and you can only pick one. oh and the thing about mortgage... it's not to keep \textbf{black} people out of white neighborhoods, it's due to them having bad credit and not qualifying for the loan but applying anyway(which bumps the statistics up to look like they were denied more but in reality its just because more blacks applied without the credit and most of the white people who applied did have the credit and the ones with bad credit didn't bother) because you guys feel like everything is owed to you and people should bow down to you so more of you try to get things the easy way or for free...because there were slaves over a hundred years ago... but only the filthy rich had them and there were white slaves too.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The "you don't look car up in the dictionary if your car is broke down, you go to the mechanic" comparison isn't used properly. It is difficult to accurately compare to different things such as a thing(car) and an idea(\textbf{racism}). However if you wanted to know what a car is you could look it up in the dictionary. Also because a car is a thing and not an idea it can be explained more clearly and without bias by using pictures. Contrarily, if you wanted to fix a car you WOULD go to a mechanic. Therefore if you want to know what the word \textbf{racism} means you could (appropriately) look it up in the dictionary. However, if you want to fix \textbf{racism} you have to know who is being affected and in what ways. \textbf{Racism} IS "a belief that \textbf{race} is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular \textbf{race}" or "racial prejudice or discrimination". The meaning/definition doesn't mention anything about power or systems. Therefore, it doesn't matter where someone lives or what \textbf{race} they are, they can be \textbf{racist}. \textbf{Racist}, as an adjective, means "of or like racists or \textbf{racism}". \textbf{Racist}, as a noun, means "a person who believes in \textbf{racism}". However, \textbf{racism} effects races differently in different areas. Therefore \textbf{African} Americans have experienced different types of oppression due to \textbf{racism}. Certain systems have been ran by racists, who were \textbf{racist} towards Blacks. Blacks have been more negatively affected by \textbf{racism} than Whites have, but to say that Blacks cannot be \textbf{racist} is idiotic and logically wrong. You could, however, say that institutional \textbf{racism} against White people is uncommon. By your logic I could say that \textbf{Black} people are inferior and shouldn't be in the same kindergarten classes (in the same school) as white kids, and it wouldn't be \textbf{racist}. There is not a majority of institutions that would say that is ok. Quite the opposite actually. The definition of prejudice is "an unfavorable opinion or feeling formed beforehand or without knowledge, thought, or reason" or "harm or injury that results or may result from some action or judgment". The definition of racial is "relating to or based on \textbf{race}". Therefore the definition of racial prejudice is simply an unfavorable opinion formed without reason or harm that results from action or judgment BASED ON \textbf{RACE}. Racial prejudice is a synonym and is used as a way to define \textbf{racism}. \textbf{Racism} IS prejudice based on \textbf{race}, also known as racial prejudice. You are saying, unless a \textbf{race} is INSTITUTIONALLY discriminated or prejudiced against based on their \textbf{race} they cannot experience \textbf{racism} (a.k.a. racial prejudice). Therefore NO ONE person can be a \textbf{racist} only institutions.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}African, Black, Race, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}28/455 & \cellcolor{green!27}6.154 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Can blacks be \textbf{racist}? The answer, of course, will depend on how you define \textbf{racism}. If you define it as 'prejudice against or hatred toward another \textbf{race},' then the answer is yes. If you define \textbf{racism} as 'the belief that \textbf{race} is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular \textbf{race},' the answer is yes. And if you define \textbf{racism} as 'prejudice and discrimination rooted in \textbf{race}-based loathing,' then the answer is, again, yes. However, if you define \textbf{racism} as 'a system of group privilege by those who have a disproportionate share of society's power, prestige, property, and privilege,' then the answer is no. In the end, it is my opinion that individual blacks can be and sometimes are racists.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Here's a few thoughts for you, since you don't seem to have many of your own:1. Don't try to defend feminism's many faults by pulling out a dictionary to claim feminism is only about equality of the sexes, and then pull out a different dictionary to discuss things like \textbf{racism} and \textbf{sexism}.2. Don't try to redefine words to give your group a free pass on serious matters like \textbf{racism} and \textbf{sexism}. Pulling out this additional "power plus privilege" bullshit makes you look like nutbags. 3. Don't make up \textbf{weird} words that have no other purpose than to insult men and stop a conversation (mansplaining, anyone?).Perhaps this will illustrate why your ideas are so vacuous and dangerous. Consider what would happen if we applied this power plus privilege to domestic abuse. You could simply claim that women can't commit domestic abuse against men, because men are more powerful, aggressive... pick any attribute you like. Ad hoc rationalizations are easy, aren't they? Or maybe we could apply this to racial violence, and declare that \textbf{black} people can't be violent towards white people.

Thus there are \textbf{RACIST} \textbf{black} people all over just as whites. That's not to mention that the most powerful position in the WORLD is held by a \textbf{black} man.And finally, the attitude that drives \textbf{racism} and racial prejudice is the exact same.

Having learned that they are able to make a living out of their troubles, they have grown into the settled habit of advertising their wrongs - partly because they want sympathy, and partly because it pays. Some of these people do not want the \textbf{Negro} to lose his grievances,  because they do not want to lose their jobs." ....... Booker T.

But the thing is \textbf{racism} is not based on a system on power. A good example of this is \textbf{sexism}. If your definition for \textbf{racism} was true and we went by that logic how can women be sexist? Women have been severely oppressed for generations because of their \textbf{gender} and many women's lives have been ruined because of this and no institution ever said anything about it, so how can women be sexist? Because the definition of \textbf{sexism} is the belief that one \textbf{gender} is superior to the other. A \textbf{woman} can believe that she is superior to men, you can't dispel a state of mind from someone just because an "institution" doesn't back them up. It's scientifically proven that is not how humans work. Just because I say that I hate cats and Obama doesn't back me up doesn't mean I don't actually hate cats. People don't need someone else's permission to believe something. I shouldn't even have to explain this to you. Are you \textbf{dumb}? The same exact thing goes for \textbf{racism}, \textbf{racism} isn't any special concept, \textbf{racism} is exactly like any other discrimination. \textbf{Black} people CAN be \textbf{racist}!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Dumb, Gender, Race, Racism, Racist, Sexism, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}26/277 & \cellcolor{green!27}9.386 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The definition of \textbf{racism} that combines power and prejudice comes from David Wellman's book entitled 'Portraits of white \textbf{racism}' (1993), and was later included in 'The Blackwell Dictionary of Sociology' by Allen G. Johnson. Personally, I think it's ridiculous to conflate and merge the traditional definition and Wellman's definition into one. And I say this as a passionate student of sociology. Because there are clearly different forms of \textbf{racism}. In recent years Institutional \textbf{racism} ["prejudice \& systematic power"] has been progressively reduced to a certain degree here in the western world. It is however still a very real problem so I do feel there is a place for this definition. But to claim that it's the best or the only definition - while trying to replace the traditional definition with the term "racial Prejudice" - is, in my view, both misguided and potentially dangerous. Now, it's important to note here that Wellman never personally stated that \textbf{black} people can't be \textbf{racist}. However, it cannot be denied that the way in which his definition was included in the Blackwell Dictionary of Sociology left the door wide open for such subjective interpretations and claims. I do not believe this was intentional but I do think it was irresponsible. It would've made far more sense to include both definitions separately, rather than simply conflating the two.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}5/223 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.242 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small You're distorting definitions here. \textbf{Racism} is a form of prejudice, namely one based around \textbf{race}/ethnicity.

All of what you're saying is complete BS. The full definition of \textbf{racism} is "A belief that \textbf{race} is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular \textbf{race}."

Now hold on, isn't that exactly what you're addressing in this video? So now, we look at your overall claim that \textbf{black} people can't be \textbf{racist}. Ok. Now let's look at the OTHER full definition of \textbf{racism}. Once again, quoted from Merriam-Webster. "Racial prejudice or discrimination." Sooooo..... what the hell?

'You can't be \textbf{racist} toward white people. \textbf{Racism} is based in systemic/institutional oppression and since there is no sociopolitical infrastructure working  against white people, white people can't be affected by \textbf{racism}!'*  =  BULLSHIT!!!   OK,so i just wanna say that she is not right,she is wrong.She claimed that quote white people have never been through systematic oppression or \textbf{racism}. That's simply not true. Historically Europe has been through many invasions and controlled and oppressed by quote  non-white Nations/Armies such as The Persians,The Huns,The Mongols,and most of all for 1400 years The Islamic Empire.But also the dark haired, short, brown eyed, Mediterranean Romans racially oppressed and systematically or institutionalize oppress the tall,blonde haired and blue eyed Celts. And no, \textbf{racism} is not the same as systematic oppression of people. The Definition of \textbf{racism} is..."the belief that all members of each \textbf{race} possess characteristics or abilities specific to that \textbf{race}, especially so as to distinguish it as inferior or superior to another \textbf{race} or races.prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different \textbf{race} based on the belief that one's own \textbf{race} is superior."...or..."Poor treatment of or violence against people because of their \textbf{race}, the belief that some races of people are better than others." – Webster <<<That's the definition of "\textbf{racism}" NOT  "systematic oppression"."Systematic oppression" is its own thing...NOT the same.First of all, NOT all systematic or institutional oppression is driven by \textbf{race}. "The systematic oppression of people" does not have too do anything with \textbf{race}...because the same \textbf{race} can oppression their own people or the people of another \textbf{nation} that's of the same \textbf{race}.The definition of systematic oppression is..."Institutionalized Oppression: Institutional Oppression occurs when established laws, customs, and practices systematically reflect and produce inequities based on one's membership in targeted social identity groups. If oppressive consequences accrue to institutional laws, customs, or practices, the institution is oppressive whether or not the individuals maintaining those practices have oppressive intentions." What she is trying to do is merge the two different definitions into the same thing,and that is dishonest and deceptive,they are NOT the same.She speaks the English language but does NOT understand it,and she is going to refined words from it....come on people don't fall for this bullshit about only white people can be \textbf{racist} but non-white people can't or only white people can systematically or institutionalize oppress people but non-whites cant.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The problem with this video is that it is racially prejudice. The ONLY THING preventing it from being "\textbf{racist}" (the sociological definition that you provided) is that your \textbf{race} does not have the power within our society. Which is not your fault or mine. If I were to do an impression of a \textbf{black} person just as you are doing here with white people, it would be \textbf{racist} because my position of power within society amplifies my racial prejudice into \textbf{racism}. However I am not in control of that. The only thing I am actually in control of is my own racial prejudice, just like you. So what you are doing here IS \textbf{racist} just without the power element, which perhaps means the proper term is racial prejudice. WHICH IS JUST AS BAD AN ACTION ON YOUR PART AS IT IS FOR A WHITE PERSON. \textbf{Racism} (by your definition) and racial prejudice are EXACTLY THE SAME ACT being done by the individual. Sure, the impact may be different because of the absence or presence of power, but that is not within one individuals control. So here is my challenge for you Franchesca and MTV News: Make a video explaining that racial prejudice and \textbf{racism} are EQUALLY MALICIOUS ACTS and stop downplaying your racial prejudice towards white people by bringing up an outside force (power) to make a white persons racial prejudice appear significantly worse. I am not saying we need to ignore the fact that white people have power in society, I'm simply saying that as a white \textbf{woman}, I was not given a vote on this matter. I didn't personally decide that I should hold more power. I was born this way just as you were born \textbf{black}.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The dictionaries definition of \textbf{racism} is 'the belief that all members of each \textbf{race} possess characteristics, abilities, or qualities specific to that \textbf{race}, especially so as to distinguish it as inferior or superior to another \textbf{race} or races.' Which would mean that all races can in fact be \textbf{racist}. But then again it 'just a dictionary' isn't it MTV? So lets talk sociology...Only white people can be \textbf{racist}, because only white people have institutional power. People of colour can be prejudiced, but they cannot be \textbf{racist}, because they do not have the institutional power. This clearly your argument here. You state that these institutions 'schools, government, the military, corporations and our justice system' hold the power to make a white person being \textbf{racist} OKAY, but not a \textbf{black} person being \textbf{racist} OKAY. Yet you never explain or show any evidence on how these institutions, such as a school, can make \textbf{racism} in ANY form OKAY. Just that they have 'white power', but you never explain your definition of power. So what really is 'white power', and how does it make only white people \textbf{racist}? Are you implying that \textbf{black} people don't any power, whatsoever? Because if you were wouldn't you be infantilising \textbf{black} people, which is clearly \textbf{racist}?

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Blacks blame all their problems on whites. All whites. Not the ones in positions of power or the ones with a lot of money. No, all whites are privileged and are why blacks are where they are today. Even the one's being born into poor white families while I type this up, are oppressing and discriminating blacks.. Sarcasm, but the way I see it is this; We as white people, regardless of our heritage or present state, should give everything to blacks for things we didn't do or take part in and \textbf{nothing} we do will ever be enough to change that. Soooo we're never going to progress as a people..   I don't think we should forget the past. We should learn from it, but don't use it to guilt trip people who can't change it or didn't take part in it. Plain and simple. Guilt tripping isn't going to change anything, but realizing we've come a very long way to be where we are today and moving on together, as a people, will change the world.   Also, Institutionalized \textbf{Racism} is a branch or specific type of \textbf{Racism}. It isn't the definition of \textbf{Racism}. If you ask me, it's just a way to allow blacks to treat whites in a \textbf{racist} way and all they have to say is, "Actually, I'm part of a disenfranchised \textbf{race} where people in power are prejudice towards me, so I can't possibly be \textbf{racist}." That makes no sense.  So until you and your people have more power you and your people don't have to care how they treat individual people because it won't be considered \textbf{racist}? Even if you or people of your \textbf{race} go out of their way to mistreat someone because of their \textbf{race}? How is that not \textbf{racist}? If assuming a ghetto looking \textbf{black} guy is a criminal, even though countless statistics prove that blacks are more prone to commit crimes than almost any other \textbf{race}, is racial profiling and \textbf{racist}. Then, assuming a white person is privileged or \textbf{racist} because of how whites treated blacks a few decades ago, is racial profiling and also \textbf{racist}.  It sounds like to me this is more about having power handed to your people, rather than \textbf{racism}. Why in all these videos about, "Institutionalized \textbf{Racism}", do I never hear about affirmative action, Equal Hiring, EBT, or other policies that have been made to help PoC get the jobs, schooling, and medicine that they need or want? Even with all these things you guys need more? When will it stop being a helping hand and start to become hand outs? Oh, and when you talk about institutionalized \textbf{racism} why don't you bring up all the companies, businesses, or groups that are entirely one \textbf{race}, that isn't white? Because it's empowerment when it's minorities, but oppression when it's the majority..

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small So, when she was talking about the numbers like "\textbf{black} people can't get homes in white neighborhoods," did they get the reasons behind these numbers? Did they get people admitting to not giving \textbf{black} people those homes because they are \textbf{black} or judges giving harsher sentences because they are \textbf{black}? Or, are they just looking at the numbers and making assumptions? I mean, I kinda thought that the reason that there are more \textbf{black} people in jail (and they get harsher sentences) is because they are the ones that commit more crime and get into crime at a younger \textbf{age}. And, I thought that this was due to the fact that they tend to live in the lower-income areas which tend to have a higher crime rate. So, as they grow up around crime, they become more susceptible to it. So, when a white person and a \textbf{black} person (same \textbf{age}) are put before the same judge for shoplifting, the \textbf{black} person has been in and out of jails for this since he was 12 and this is the white person's 3rd time. Obviously, harsher punishments for the one who has done it more, right? If anyone has any sort of proof of the reasons behind the statistics that are in the video (and, I mean showing the sources of websites or articles that I can look at myself), please show me. Also, I'm not saying that white people can't be \textbf{racist} (I know a few myself) and, I get what she means by it's "who's in power," but, it's an extremely ignorant thing to say that \textbf{black} people have no power.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small This is difficult, because I love Franchesca and most of what she's saying is true, but she's still defining \textbf{racism} wrong.  The definition that she gives as the dictionary definition isn't even a good dictionary definition.  When I googled it, this is what I got- \textbf{racism}- the belief that all members of each \textbf{race} posses characteristics or abilities specific to that \textbf{race}, especially so as to distinguish it as inferior or superior to another \textbf{race}.  Now, I would expand that definition to- believing that a certain group is inferior or superior to another on the basis of \textbf{race}/racial features, \textbf{ethnicity}, \textbf{nationality}, and/or culture.  All of these things are \textbf{racism}, regardless of who has the power. It is true that when minorities are \textbf{racist} against those in a position of privilege it cannot actually bring down their group as a whole, but that doesn't make the situation not \textbf{racist}.  \textbf{Racism} is a mindset, not a system.  \textbf{Racism} is ingrained in the system, but it is not the system itself. At its core, believing that \textbf{race} is a thing in the first place is \textbf{racist}.  This is not to say, be colorblind, but understand that the only thing that connects people of a single "\textbf{race}" is that they are experiencing oppression in the same way because people have made arbitrary assumptions about them based on their features and/or their racial/ethnic label(s). It is a important to remember that \textbf{race} has no basis in biology- i.e. as an African-American \textbf{woman} (hate that label, but that's a different discussion), I am more closely related to the whitest American that you can find than I am to any "\textbf{black}" person in Africa, Haiti, or the Caribbean.  Hopefully, people learn. \textbf{Race} still matters and we have to acknowledge it until we can fully apply an understanding that it's not real, which will be evidenced only by the full removal of the inequality in our social system. But yeah, \textbf{racism} is not about hatred- that is just a result.  \textbf{Racism} is about believing that there are "real" differences between people of different races and that those differences make one group better or worse than another.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Ethnicity, Nationality, Race, Racism, Racist, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}20/358 & \cellcolor{green!27}5.587 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small +octavus augustus This is an observation coming from someone who's Asian and lives in the US. From what I see it's mainly \textbf{African} Americans who don't want the country to forget about slavery, and want equality. But even if they try to give them equality it's never good enough. White people aren't spoon fed everything, but \textbf{African} Americans feel that they deserve to be spoon fed without ever having to work for it. For instance schooling I've seen many \textbf{African} Americans complain about how they want college to be free to their community, or how colleges are \textbf{racist} because there are more white people than blacks...so what their saying is because I'm \textbf{black} you're overlooking me when in fact it's because the college simply thought of their grades more. My ancestors were slaves too, I get racially discriminated against too because of my eyes, but I still work hard and got my shit together despite the past, and you know what...I know a lot of colleges where Asians are the top percentage followed by white and then blacks. It's because we fucking work hard. It's annoying to see \textbf{black} people admitted to colleges because of their skin tone instead of their hard work simply because they don't want to be defined as a \textbf{racist} college. What's even worse is that \textbf{African} Americans don't seem to realize the problem is within their community, how you going to get a good fucking education when you're out on the streets screwin around or selling drugs?

It's about giving available slots to people of color based on their racial makeup — not based on achievement or actual rights. The \textbf{woman} in this video probably isn't smart enough to grasp this concept because she is merely a tool for the machine. Moreover, she, and those like her want things taken away from white people and given to her - instead of her actually producing anything that merits her to have it. She has been programmed, mainly by the white left to remain in a constant state of victimhood. Once she begins to think for herself, or actually rise in the ranks, she becomes a huge threat to the left wing. That is why \textbf{black} conservatives are immediately attacked and labeled "uncle Toms." They won't stay on the plantation and that angers the left immensely. The level of propaganda this dolt has been subjected to is designed to create large groups of people dependent on the state —thus allowing cultural marxists to gain wealth from suppression, oppression and taxation. It's the essence of communism.The minorities and useful idiot whites that push this propaganda have no idea how far off the grid they actually are. They literally cannot see how they are the bigots. How they are the racists. They have no earthly idea how much they have been tricked into bringing about a societal system that has devoured every society in which it has been implemented. A system that will eventually leave them dead. Those that do understand the inner workings of this societal model and promote it using this kind of propaganda should pay with their lives. They are the definition of evil.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Common, Racist, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}4/341 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.173 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small All of this is illogical opinionated hogwash. 1) The term "\textbf{Racism}", is simply the worldview which believes in \textbf{race}. Its an "ism". It has \textbf{nothing} to do with being prejudice. The correct term for that term is "Racial Prejudice" or "Racial Persecution."2) Assuming we are still going to use the term "\textbf{Racism}", the term "Reverse \textbf{Racism}" is redundant. In that situation, it is simply a person or organization being "\textbf{Racist}" towards a target. If one person has the backing of institution in their "\textbf{Racism}", then it is those institutions plus the person, being "\textbf{Racist}" towards a target. The target, whom may be alone, is also nonetheless, "\textbf{Racist}" as well. \textbf{Racism} isn't a term of scale.3) In terms of minimizing racial prejudice, I would state that it is difficult because in my experience, and from what I have read, and heard from other people, racial prejudice is a natural behavior. Different \textbf{ethnic} groups tend to migrate towards each other, and any attempt to create a multi-\textbf{ethnic}, (and associably multicultural) society, is an uphill battle, that fights against the state of things brought upon by millions of years of evolution. To create a society like this, is to commit to a cause to bring about something entirely new. Personally I find the endeavor to be useless, destructive (of diversity) and a waste of time.

"If we treat everybody equal, by taking \textbf{race} out of the problem, that's not good enough" That is EXACTLY what the Navy does now. We base people off of a piece of paper called an evaluation.

Please tell me how that is \textbf{racist}/prejudice?

There is a sociological aspect I agree, but we live in a time when diversity, and equal opportunity both do have serious cache in society. There is power in that. How many times have you seen white person make like an activist to 'impress their \textbf{black} friend', like in your video on whitesplaining? It would be different if you said that there are institutions that have \textbf{racist}, if tacit policies regarding POC, but you say before that 'good people can accidentally do \textbf{racist} things.' Why does the fact that the people don't happen to be discriminated against in the same way mean that they are eligible to be called \textbf{racist}, while others are not? You cite a goal to begin to address problems of inequality - why would you begin by portioning segments of society based on skin color to bestow yet another difference? It doesn't make any sense - I thought we got past this whole '\textbf{black} people can't be \textbf{racist}' thing.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Racism is not about oppression, it's about tribalism.  Even if one were to accept YOUR definition from sociology, that does not automatically disqualify the word as it's been in use.  You can't say '\textbf{racism} isn't racial prejudice'.  Yes, it is.  Try as you like that definition exists and will continue to exist.  I don't acknowledge sociological definitions.  I regard sociology as a pseudo science.  A bunch of biased individuals interpreting subjective data to fit their desired result.  With that kind of system, they could prove crystals are magical.  They love nebulous boogie-man terms, which is what they're trying to turn \textbf{racism} into.  Let me explain why these nebulous boogie-men concepts are a bad thing to propagate: If an individual fails, based on merit,, it's the fault of \textbf{racism} in this context unless they're white.  The game is rigged and there's no hope.  There is no individual accountability or even an encouragement in that direction.   Meanwhile \textbf{indian} immigrants and asian immigrants keep kicking fiscal and educational ass.  They're thriving in this \textbf{racist} country.  Why?.  If anything is harming minorities and immigrants in society it's these nefarious boogie-man concepts you use to excuse people.  These low expectations are poison to any culture, and it's concepts like this that enable it.  Society doesn't set your expectations.  Your parents did.  Your peers did.  Most importantly, YOU did.  What expectations are you setting for your children?   It's almost like a new version of 'white man's burden.'.  As though it's the responsibility of white people to lift up others.  This attitude enables 'white supremacy'.  Although if you measure success by wealth then White supremacy favors asians.  So now where are we?  Why do asians kick ass at IQ tests culturally biased towards white people?  I can't fix \textbf{black} culture.  I can't make dads raise their kids.  I can't stop \textbf{black} women from aborting 30 of the next generation.  I can't stop \textbf{black} kids from reaching out to gangs because they can't reach out to a father.  To deny the lack of accountability here is insane.  These particular issues weren't a problem in the freaking \textbf{Jim C\textbf{row}} era.  They're new, so they're not caused by oppression because \textbf{black} people are sure a helluva lot less oppressed now.You can make a million videos just like this and change \textbf{nothing}.  If you try to help people on an individual level, you can move mountains.  This collectivist attitude is not good.  We're all individuals with our own agency, our own needs, and our own desires.

You talk about going 'deeper' which means expanding the definition into an umbrella term. That's why people tell you it's convenient, because now you can stretch definitions to anything you want, to any degree you want. People who think critically will call you out on this.1:00 Your car analogy is a faulty analogy. Cars are built to be fundamentally the same. If we're talking about bodies, yes we are, but when talking about ideology like \textbf{racist} ones, people have different experiences, ideas and education.1:27 Setting aside the wig you put on which could be offensive by your standards, if someone unintentionally says something YOU think is \textbf{racist}, that does NOT make them or their action \textbf{racist}. That's your idea or experience.

If it wasn't bad, why is it 1 on your list?1:47 You are claiming that people can be unintentionally \textbf{racist} by supporting institutions that are \textbf{racist} without knowing it.  You are calling them bad. You strip the individual of all merit because of something they DID NOT INTEND TO DO. And given your plastic definition of \textbf{racism}, I expect your list of '\textbf{racist}' organizations to be very long. Chances are everything this person likes is "unintentionally \textbf{racist}".1:56 You ARE playing the blame-game.

This by default is putting a good person on the same level as an asshole who burns crosses in yards. Intent is what the legal system looks at for crimes. Intent is the driving force. \textbf{Racism} is beliefs, opinions, ideas, prejudice - if you don't have those things how are you \textbf{racist}... how are you not \textbf{racist}? We don't know, because we don't have intent. You can move the goal post to anywhere on the field and score a victory with this argument. 2:23 \textbf{Racism} is real, but it's not so broad and wide as you make it out to be.2:27 Yea, it is, but people like you are keeping the divide nice and bold. Your white straw-man seems interested in all-inclusiveness and you have a problem with that. We established they're good and not intending any racial harm. They want to INCLUDE you and YOU are calling them \textbf{racist}? Brilliant.2:49 another faulty analogy. People can't eat without money. People can't fill up their car and go to work without money. People can't afford their homes without money. You can't survive without income or some such. You can survive being different colors. Money is a social construct that we need as is LAW and LANGUAGE - we need those to function. We don't need SKIN constructs, because there is no FUNDAMENTAL difference. How is marriage like \textbf{race}? Oh, when YOU say it is. Okay.3:07 I thought that was the aim of the Civil Rights Movement? I thought that was Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream? I get 'colorblindness' is another plastic definition that somehow (according to you) denigrates all \textbf{black} people. But how exactly do you propose keeping up racial barriers to fix \textbf{racism}? That does not compute. You want something to go away, you REMOVE IT. YOU WANT \textbf{RACISM}. You go on to say \textbf{race} isn't the problem, but we've already established that good people aren't trying to be \textbf{racist}. They're trying to include you, but you are saying "NO, there is a difference between you and I - I'm \textbf{black} and you're a \textbf{racist}!" How is \textbf{race} NOT the problem??? It's CORE to your video. They weren't treating you differently because of your \textbf{race} - YOU inferred that were based on YOUR experience and ideas. If you remove \textbf{race} from the equation, how can you people be treated differently then? What's the basis? The color of skin? Again, you are the one touting these racial divisions and \textbf{race} is EVERYTHING your argument.3:28 Yes, there are SKIN deep differences and you're now agreeing with your straw-man. No duh there are physical differences, but that's what people like me are telling you. We don't care about that as much as you do. That's what people people mean when they say we're all human, but your plastic definition stops being collective here and briefly becomes individualistic here.3:34 Oh finally, we agree on something straight on. You're right. Reverse-\textbf{racism} is not a thing. \textbf{RACISM} IS \textbf{RACISM}. Now you're splitting \textbf{racism} from racial prejudice. They're the same thing according to the definition. Let's say your straw-man was beat up and bullied over their color... how were they a victim of racial prejudice and not \textbf{racism}? 3:55 and here is the truth in all of this: you want POWER. Even though your white straw-man was beat up for being white, that's not \textbf{racism}, because white people are in power. What twisted double-think is this?? Okay, we have a \textbf{black} president, the highest office in the US, access to nukes, subs, subs with nukes, etc... you have defeated your whole argument with one bullet point. You can't suffer \textbf{racism}, because you have a \textbf{black} man in power. Oh, you have no ties to the President? He's not going to invite you to the White House? Well, why are there whites in prison when they just have to call their executive and get a pardon??4:16 Okay, so we got social systems in place to run a country. You say these things shape how we think of people as a group and as individuals.  Schools. Gov't. Military. Corporations. Justice System. The shape blacks as a group... so education = bad. Gov't = bad. Military = bad. Corperations = bad. Justice System = bad. All this despite \textbf{black} scholarships, equal opportunity, affirmative action (even in the military), and cases like Brown vs Board of Education 1954 and all subsequent action to bring liberty to all US citizens. Are the issues with these systems? Maybe, but you're gonna need citations if you're saying there's a problem, because I just pointed out things that FAVOR \textbf{black} folks as a group and individually. And back into collectivism we go.4:27 Citation Needed. You're basically claiming Affirmative Action/Equal Opportunity doesn't exist.4:36 Citation Needed. Judges are typically harsher on repeat offender, just FYI. You didn't specify, you just said same crime.4:40 Citation Needed. How does their credit look? Credit and income is what loan companies often look at, but I'm no expert. A second citation is needed for the 'keeping them out of predominately white neighborhoods'. You're claiming this is a problem faced by all \textbf{black} people, so you need a lot of citations actually.4:49 So, given your unproven assertions, this proves white people are in power so white people can't be racially targeted even though they may be beaten for their color, as per your straw-man.4:48 Of course your straw-man never thought of it that way, because everything you've mentioned is deceptive.5:03 That's the problem with plastic definitions. They can be applied to any situation of any context. Everything is \textbf{racist}, but how to sell that idea while looking like a sane person? Appeal to white guilt, perfect. Even though you're calling them a \textbf{racist} and essentially a bad person, it's okay, because they're good and will buy your nonsense.Here's my conception your video:You're a hypocrite and your argument is baseless and offensive.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I agree with the majority of what you said, but it should be pointed out that most words, including "\textbf{racism}", can have different meanings and definitions depending on the context. The fact that some sociologists define the word "\textbf{racism}" more narrowly as "racial prejudice plus power" does not render other definitions of the term invalid. While the term "\textbf{racism}" can refer specifically to institutional discrimination of one \textbf{ethnic} group by a more dominant one, it can just as easily refer more generally to racial prejudice or the ideological belief in racial superiority. The sociological definition is only one of several. Other than that, you're right that \textbf{racism} committed by white people against non-white people in countries like the United States carries with it a lot more weight than the other way around.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnic, Racism & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}5/132 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.788 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Is she...... imitating a white \textbf{woman}? Alright, let's get down to it. She talks about the institution of \textbf{racism}, but whose really holding that up? A lot of \textbf{black} people are in poor communities because of some past injustice, but that's that. It's in the past and \textbf{nothing} can be done about it now, unless you acknowledge "\textbf{black}" as more than just a skin color. They don't deserve any better simply for that fact. Sure, no one deserves to be poor, and that should be fixed, but it's not \textbf{racist}. She's acting as if \textbf{racism} is ingrained into us all from birth, that it's genetic. the reality is, cops target \textbf{black} people, not because they have an ingrained racial hatred in them, but because they happened to be stationed in poor \textbf{black} neighborhoods where-in they have reason to suspect a \textbf{black} person. this wouldn't exist if the \textbf{black} people weren't poor. And sure that's not fair at all,  but it's how we humans function. It means that a rich community will see little violence compared to a poor ones. The cops in that rich neighborhood would show almost no racial discrimination, I guarantee it, mostly because they rarely are searching for crime in the first place. So basically, \textbf{racism} can be solved by destroying income wage gaps, even temporarily. Get \textbf{black} people out of cheap neighborhoods, and diversify. That would create the colorblindness that we need to end this \textbf{racism} issue that is in reality a non issue straight from the beginning, because the reality is, if you take a \textbf{black} person out of the ghetto and replace it with a white person, you'd have the same situation. A HUMAN would be targeted for being POOR. It really has very little to due with \textbf{race}. \textbf{Racism} is only a side effect of a currently much more severe issue of the wage gap, plus a lot to do with the mindless war on drugs.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I actually like this video. Very well done.  I like that she addressed some popular criticisms which I had myself. I don't mind having a word for "power + prejudice", I just think that the word \textbf{racism} at it's English roots should be what the dictionary definition is. However, it's all irrelevant to the issue at hand. The real issue is how some people go about fixing this '\textbf{racism}'. \textbf{Black} lives matter interrupting Bernie Sanders at his own convention, a man who fought for civil rights with MLK, and then calling him a \textbf{racist} isn't how you fix this. Another thing that doesn't fix the problem is making quotas. Quotas discriminate against people based on their gender/\textbf{race}. Equal opportunity is more important. So like she said, if people are being rejected from neighbor hoods based on their \textbf{race} and not merit then I agree that shouldn't happen. Overall I liked the video.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Race, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}4/152 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.632 \\  \hline

That sounds like a pointless condition, and it does not assert that as blacks being incapable of \textbf{racism} - it sounds more \textbf{racist} to claim that, because there are plenty of \textbf{black} people that're quite well off. Evoking it as the replacing definition of \textbf{racism} is also ridiculous, because this seems to be a stipulative definition, which does not replace former definitions. The official definition of \textbf{racism} still remains as racial prejudice towards ANY \textbf{race}.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years \textbf{old} when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this video gave me cancer anyway.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}1/119 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.84 \\  \hline

I only see \textbf{black} girls forced to straightened their hair to look more white, I see whites portrayed in the media as good while blacks as violent  or \textbf{dumb},   I see the VAST MAJORITY of middle and high class America is white and  soooo many other little things that are all manifestations of oppression. THATS WHAT IM TALKING ABOUT HERE, not individuals, i'm and Francesca is addressing the umbrella of \textbf{Racism}.This problem is you (white people), \textbf{BLACK} PEOPLE DON'T WANT \textbf{RACISM}! like seriously, we don't want it, we NEVER wanted since the begining of America. But it's up to white America to make an effort. And we are talking about America, not Europe, not Cannada, America. Even does "Northerns" who helped slaves escape. Just because white people a kind doesn't mean they don't benefit from White Privilege, so that point is invalid.And no, being Colourblind means not seeing color, which is wrong. I'm \textbf{black}, you're white, both are beautiful, but don't have preconceived notions on who i am just because of my \textbf{race}. So if we're talking about judging someone based on only character and not \textbf{race}, thats called being normal, NOT colourblind. People who say they are colour \textbf{blind} are fooling themselves. I'm \textbf{black}, it's part of my identity, its a VERY large part of my culture and what I do, it doesn't define ALL that i am, i am more than my skin, but it's still a large part of my identity. We are all human beings here, human beings naturally judge others by appearance that just human nature, what the fault is making a "standard" to that appearance which not everyone can attain. And the "standard" is being white. Simple as that, which is wrong, because America comes in all colours.So no, \textbf{black} people can't be \textbf{racist}. Doesn't mean they can't be evil, gosh, some blacks are complete cunts, some whites are cunts, some asians are cunts. Evil and Violence has no colour it comes in everyone, but \textbf{Racism} in a white country run by white people in white society, nah, I don't think so.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Blind, Dumb, Race, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}20/538 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.717 \\  \hline

That's impossible lady.The only solution to the issue of \textbf{racism} is to treat everybody equally, which is what colorblindness strives to achieve. You can go back and forth arguing nonsensical arguments about this and that and whatever, but let me be clear: The only way we are ever going to truly eradicate \textbf{racism} is by ignoring our racial differences. Sure, there's \textbf{nothing} wrong with proclaiming your \textbf{race}. But truthfully, if you people want to solve \textbf{racism}, we need to stop the idiotic divide-and-conquer tactics.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small +Phil H I understand what she meant, but I share your sentiment, she is being vague on purpose because being direct and thorough exposes the subtle juxtaposition she makes when talking about colorblindness.In her position, colorblindness doesn't stop a third party (that isn't colorblind) from being \textbf{racist}, whether that third party intends to or not. And this is a problem for her, because she wants to end \textbf{racism}, but the people who are colorblind aren't ending this \textbf{racism}, which they have a responsibility to do.

She either doesn't acknowledge or understand that in context, you ignore \textbf{race} when you decide how you are going to treat someone. And that is the message that we end up getting. Stopping yourself from being \textbf{racist} isn't good enough anymore. Watching her videos sometimes make me feel like I am listening to a Sith Lord. The "either you are with us or you are against us mentality" seeps through a lot of her videos. Look at the whole Kylie Jenner cornrows "incident".

You feel as if your people are entitled to special treatment because of past discrimination towards your \textbf{race}, but you would be the first to deny it if a group of discriminated whites were asking for the same thing. No One Deserves Special Treatment. If you think there's no \textbf{racism} towards white then go visit Philly, Baltimore, or Detroit and ask them what they think about people. I am white and I live is a majority \textbf{black} neighborhood in Philly and I dealt with the bullshit. I've been robbed and just last July I was assaulted by 3 \textbf{black} men which resulted in me having a concussion, broken nose, two front teeth missing over 75 of the bone(which costed over \$2000 to fix) , and a broken metacarpal.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Franchesca, you are part of the problem if you are suggesting that only white people can be \textbf{racist}!  While in your video you claim that \textbf{racism} is more complex than the dictionary definition, all you have done is beat around the bush suggesting that being born white makes you a \textbf{racist} while blaming the institutions of our society.  It matters not of what color of skin you have or where you come from, anyone can be \textbf{racist}.  Statistically speaking, yes, there are more \textbf{black} people in jail and prison and the reason is not because of \textbf{racism}, it is because of the social structure of the \textbf{black} family.  A high percentage of \textbf{black} men having children and get locked up because they committed a crime, leaving a large number of single women to raise their sons with no strong male role models in their lives to show them how to  be a good and contributing member of society, leaving another generation of young men to think that being a man means you have to live a thug lifestyle to be a man and that the rules of society do not apply to them.  If you think that that statement is wrong, just look at all of the rap artists that young men look up to...  they are promoting that it is cool to treat women like hoes, slapping women, to do drugs, carry a gun, and rap about killing other gangsters and doing hard time like it is cool and that is just the way of life! A majority, not all, but a majority of \textbf{black} people think and believe they should have entitlements because of their ancestors endured. ..  to be honest no \textbf{black} person has endured slavery since slavery was abolished and should have no rights to entitlements because of the color of their skin, being \textbf{black}, white, or any color.  As a matter of fact, entitlement is probably the number one cause of \textbf{racism} and division in this country!  The 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution: Abolition of Slavery13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution: Abolition of Slavery.Passed by Congress on January 31, 1865, and ratified on December 6, 1865, the 13th amendment abolished slavery in the United States and provides that "Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.".Slavery hasn't existed in 150 years.  And we all know that \textbf{black} people struggled for years for social equality, reaching it's peak in 1965 when the "Voting rights Act" was passed allowing anyone despite their \textbf{race} or color of skin the right to vote and effectively banned all discriminatory practices that previously kept minorities from casting a vote and enforcing the Act with federal oversight.  From 1965 to the the 1990's, \textbf{racism} was becoming a thing of the past.  Yes there are still \textbf{racist} people, but they have become the minority up until more recent events.  I don't know if \textbf{racism} can ever completely be eradicated. ..  you will always have those small pockets of people who think people should stick to their own \textbf{race}, but as for your video you have given every reason to call a white person a \textbf{racist}, even as far as to say they can be \textbf{racist} even if they don't know they are being \textbf{racist}.  so let me get this straight. ..  a \textbf{racist} is a \textbf{racist}, even if you don't know what you are saying or doing, is \textbf{racist},  being colorblind and not seeing a \textbf{race}, is \textbf{racist}, choosing to speak or not to speak about \textbf{racism}, is \textbf{racist}....  so now we know that anything a white person might say or do directly or indirectly is or can be \textbf{racist}, do you have a definition of what isn't \textbf{racist}?\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Race, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}30/644 & \cellcolor{green!27}4.658 \\  \hline

I am also confused as to why \textbf{racism}, as defined by sociology, is not person-to-person, but the sociological definition of conversation is a interactive and spontaneous communication that is person-to-person(s).

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Racism does happen to white people, I have experienced it myself. When I turned down a gentleman who wanted to go out with me, he immediately assumed it was because he was \textbf{black}. He accused me of \textbf{racism}, called me \textbf{w\textbf{hite trash}} and a whore among other things. The reason I had turned him down, was because at the time I was already in a relationship. I do not judge people by their color, they could be purple with pink polka dots and it would not matter to me. But I have been called \textbf{w\textbf{hite trash}} etc. by people of color when they did not get their way or I did not agree with them. And no, I did not do anything to instigate it. I do agree with the idea of prejudice, I think many minorities are prejudiced and jaded by people who are white because of treatment they received in the past and sadly do still experience today. But labeling everyone with the same brush is wrong, and could become \textbf{racism} in both parties. Someone who is frequently mistreated or had a bad experience can easily have a bad outlook towards everyone of that \textbf{race}.  I know I will not see any improvements in my time, but I hope for my daughters future that \textbf{racism} is something consigned to the history books. That no one will get any benefits based on their skin color, ill treatment from it, and that people will celebrate their heritages but not let it become a divide between them and others.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Race, Racism, White Trash & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Ethnicity - White, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}10/258 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.876 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Where do you start with this? First of all, MTV doesnt care about '\textbf{racism}', it doesnt give two shits. MTV just thinks that it will be more 'hip' and liberal and 21st century if it appeals to whiny, extreme, distorted, absurd social justice warrior views on \textbf{race} and \textbf{gender}. 2nd, this is so insidious because it frames \textbf{racism} as something originally white. The very phrase 'reverse \textbf{racism}' implies that white \textbf{racism} is the original \textbf{racism}, the 1st edition, when in fact this is not true. Races through history have been in constant conflict, as well as within their own races. White Europe just so happened to take over the world and gain dominance and hence its own \textbf{racism} became the most powerful. But to suggest that only whites can be \textbf{racist} is such a \textbf{weird} distortion of history and reality that it boggles the mind. Not to mention it is \textbf{racist} in itself. And also, appealing to sociology for definitions doesnt make it 'true', it just means your appealing to the least rigorous and respected science, which is in fact a cesspit of obscurantism, pretentious word salads and left wing lunacy. 3rd, just a general fuck you to MTV for peddling this shit. This SJW philosophy is anti reason, anti history, anti fact, anti white, male, 'cis', basically anti anyone who isnt a non-white feminist playing the victim card to feel important, to feel as if theyre fighting some great injustice. But the worst thing is the righteous tone. There is not even a hint that this is taking place in the context of discourse or argument. There is no argument for these people, its all been settled. And their mission in life is to smugly peddle their neurotic, fantasy versions of \textbf{race} and \textbf{gender} to the world and to label all who expose their BS as BS racists, sexists etc, and then make up terms like 'white fragility'. The SJW crows are pathetic pissbabies who want to feel righteous, but in the end they become stuffy, stale, boring, weak, whiny losers who only erode discourse and rational argument to replace it with rhetoric and ideology.

One question for you though: My friend is \textbf{African}, lives in Germany and came to visit NY with her German ("white" husband).

After living among predominately "white" people in Germany she had been so excited about being in a place where most people are "\textbf{black}". She felt the way she was treated was the biggest disappointment in her life and \textbf{nothing} had prepared her for that. She said those people in NY were more \textbf{racist} (her words not mine) than anything she had experienced in Germany. I know you said in your video \textbf{racism} is about power of institutions etc. What about this situation, was that not borderline? If a society rejects you? Is that not power as well?

Why is it that I feel that you would say those scientists who disagree are \textbf{racist}?  Seeing \textbf{racism} this way forces us into circular thinking, where every interaction self validates the concept,  IE, if you think something is \textbf{racist}, there is always a way to validate it.  That is a bad ideological concept.More frustratingly, it is only in the last 45 years or so that this concept of \textbf{race}, where it has to involve institutionalized power and prejudice (this idea has really only solidified in the last 5 years or so).  It isn't something you can 'prove,' it was just decided that this was going to be the definition in activist culture.Conveniently is has eliminated the concept of reverse \textbf{racism} which, sorry to say, absolutely exists.  You have certainly tried to create a definition where it does not, which honestly might be a \textbf{racist} project all on its own, but when I watch a video of protests in Missouri and watch a young man say "I hate you because you're white.  What's happening here is all of your people's fault because your white" even though he has no idea who he is even talking to, that is \textbf{racism}.  If you want it to fit into your definition, I can make that happen for you.  In that young man's community, whiteness is actually an indicator of weakness, cowardice, and a predisposition towards evil acts.  His community leaders, family, and teachers, ie, his institutions, will support this idea.  Any white-ish person that enters his community will be vilified due to engendered prejudice.  So there ya go.  \textbf{Racism}.The definition has been altered and made more specific.  It now conflates situations where a person simply feels uncomfortable with situations where a person is actually being marginalized.And just a note, this entire video is filled with microaggressions against white women.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small +clint johnson She's right about one thing, there is no such thing as "reverse \textbf{racism}." \textbf{Racism} is not a directional measurement. It has no forwards or backwards. Racial bias towards people of another \textbf{race} is \textbf{racism}, plain and simple. Her prejudice + power explanation fails to understand that prejudice and power are two factors of \textbf{racism}. Factors have to be weighed with one another. Thus, if there is a large amount of one factor, but only a small amount of the other, the sheer breadth of the one can be enough to denote \textbf{racism} by itself. Thus, a minority who says, "I hate all white people, I hope they all die," is exhibiting so much prejudice as to easily be \textbf{racism}. Likewise, a decision by a city council to tear down the homes in a minority community in order to build a large business(maybe a mall or sewage treatment plant), while economically driven with no actual racial bias driving the decision, can still be a form of institutional \textbf{racism}, due to the exorbitant negative effect that it has on primarily minorities. The prejudice + power factors is more of a part of this type of institutional \textbf{racism}, and isn't meant to require the actor to be in power or part of the majority to be exhibiting \textbf{racism}. Like I said, racial bias toward a member of another \textbf{race} is \textbf{racism}, plain and simple. The problem is, people like Ms. Ramsey here are misunderstanding the meaning of institutional \textbf{racism}, and are coming on shows like this trying to teach young people their incorrect understanding of the concept.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I don't know what dictionary that definition of \textbf{racism} came from, but it's not accurate. \textbf{Racism} is defined as being the belief that another \textbf{race} has characteristics that make them inferior. Which leaves something to be said about the fact that you openly mock white Americans and then redefine \textbf{racism} to include the socio-economic power structure and in doing so suggest that \textbf{black} Americans are exempt from being \textbf{racist} or partaking in any kind of bigotry.  But that's neither here nor there. I've said this many times. If you sit down and talk to people who claim to be \textbf{racist}, the issue comes down to them disliking the culture. \textbf{Black} Americans, more than any other \textbf{race} in America, tend to group themselves as a whole by their \textbf{race}. They're depicted in media by "\textbf{black} culture." The loud, thuggish and obnoxious 'real talkers' who are just abrasive and annoying. \textbf{Nobody} wants to deal with that. The people who typically fall into and propagate this stereotype are also the people who are most likely to bitch about the nonsense things as being \textbf{racism}, rather than things that are actually \textbf{racism}.  All this does is give America the idea that \textbf{black} Americans largely behave like assholes and then bitch when things don't go their way. \textbf{Nobody} wants to deal with that. Humans, by nature, judge people who are different than them. It's a survival mechanism. So, while people who fall into this category are likely to say things like "s/he succeeded despite the white man," or things that imply that, it's more likely that a \textbf{black} Americans who succeed do so despite the \textbf{black} community, by not falling into this culture, where you have to meet certain standards to be '\textbf{black} enough.' I'm not trying to say that \textbf{black} Americans bring \textbf{racism} on themselves, but as she described it in this video, \textbf{racism} in America also has to do with socio-economic power structure. Anyone who is different is a potential threat and if I have power, it's easier for me to neutralize that threat one way or another. It's human nature. No amount of fit throwing is going to change that. But when you've got media saying \textbf{black} Americans are mostly type A and the type A people are often abrasive \textbf{race} baiters, it makes it harder for the type B people in that \textbf{race}. Of course, it doesn't help that \textbf{black} America is blaming all of white America for the potentially unjust shooting of \textbf{black} Americans by police officers. \textbf{Black} Americans have been killing \textbf{black} Americans for years and \textbf{black} Americans were never up in arms about that. Now, police, who are honestly probably just doing their job, get on TV for shooting \textbf{black} Americans and everyone's up in arms. Which, by the way, there are vastly more white Americans killed by police each year under similar circumstances to any of the televised cases of \textbf{black} Americans being killed and the majority of \textbf{black} Americans killed by police are killed by \textbf{black} police officers. It's just not televised, because that wouldn't get the ratings. So, what it boils down to is that there's not enough personal accountability in this country. If everyone practiced personal accountability, taking responsibility only for their own actions while giving others responsibility only for their own actions, this country could get its shit together. Everyone wants to say what not to do on so many subjects, but \textbf{nobody} ever wants to say what can be done to fix shit. Personal accountability would fix it. Practice it. Preach it. Teach it.

And did you know that if someone has a "\textbf{black}" sounding last name on a resume they're less likely to be called back than a "white" sounding last name. The ghettos are a product of white flight, where as \textbf{African} Americans began to move into America, white people would start to leave, an the ghettos are a product of that. Blacks were forced to move into cheaper places in the 50's and 60's and those places were urban and uncared for since no one cared about minorities. If you're a \textbf{black} kid from the ghetto who tried his best at a underfunded school, do you think that they stand a chance against a rich white kid who lived in the suburbs and got alot of tutoring and practice because of his rich parents?

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@TedGoranson69 Have you not been to the ghetto? Have you lived under a rock for the past 50 or so years? Blacks tend to live in poverty, which can be attributed to the systems that were in place around the 50's and 60's concerning housing and the fact that white people left the areas where more minorities would come. Where you have high rates of poverty, you have high rates of crime. The police in urban places of poverty, such as Compton, are mostly white. Just think abotu Rodney King. It shows the racial tension that can come while living in these areas. Even though Rodney King was committing a crime, you still have police with racial bias in an area with high racial tension. They beat him almost to death because of that fact. It's out of control, and anyone who's ever lived in an urban setting will tell you that racial tension is high in these areas. These are the problems that need to be fixed. Granted, they aren't going to be fixed because some girl on tumblr screams "cultural appropriation!" when a white girl wears dreads.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@blahblahyackity No. Socioeconomic status and \textbf{race} are both factors in admissions process because they both greatly effect how a person is viewed. A \textbf{black} person coming from the ghetto is going to be seen all their life as a "thug" or "ganster", even a \textbf{black} person who doesn't come from the ghetto. It's racial bias that we all hold, that \textbf{black} people and the ghetto are related. A white kid from a poor community has the hardship of being poor, which will be taken into great consideration during an admissions process. However, that white kid doesn't face the racial bias that a \textbf{black} or latino person is going to face throughout their lives. The color of your skin effects you immensely, even more so when you come from a certain place. Certainly, if a poor white kid and a rich \textbf{black} kid are put against eachother, and the white kid has faced for adversity and only has slightly lower qualifications than the \textbf{black} kid, the white kid will probably have the advantage then. If we were to only look at someone's qualifications, and not their background, you'd have significant issue. If we're only looking at how well someone did, we're not taking into account the hardships they faced as being a non-white American, socioeconomic status, and how that ties in together.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The thought of being bullied by minorities? That actually can be, by definition provided by this video, situationally cases of \textbf{racism}.

And prejudice is omnipresent.Imagine a white person walks out the back of a bar into a dark parking lot, and he is met by a group of mean-spirited, prejudiced people of (choose your favorite minority here), with \textbf{nobody} to witness what happens. In that situation, the white person is outnumbered and likely outpowered. And with \textbf{nothing} to keep their actions in check, if they so wanted to push him around, call him names, or even physically attack him... that is having both power and prejudice against his \textbf{race} -- thus, \textbf{racism}.Or if a white person steps into a neighborhood where everyone hates white people and there are some prone to hate crimes? Ditto.In any situation where the white person does not have their social protections in place, they can feel the same kind of fear as a minority that worries about being treated unfairly.If I travel down into the inner city where crime is rampant, sure, it could be possible that maybe white and minority people are equally/proportionally victimized, but the presence of people who express prejudice against white people in white society gives a proof-of-concept to us; logically speaking, isn't it possible for those same kind of prejudiced people to exist in the lawless territories, thus increasing your risk of being a victim of hate crimes? In those lawless territories, the mob rule makes the rules.It's nowhere near proportionally equal, but it still exists. Especially when you consider that not all power is of the kind that the government can hold.Fear tends to cause \textbf{racism}, including hate crimes. As long as there is fear of hate crimes, hate crimes will be committed in retalliation by someone. Leading to more hate crimes. It's a rather vicious cycle that keeps getting drug on and on.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@VIVlVl​​ so what you're telling me is that you want me to explain the entire current state of American \textbf{racism} in one comment. You may not value my time but I do. America has my best interest in mind? When is this ever the case? America and American schools are still segregated,they have been since the 60's. In fact American schools are more segregated than in 1968. Schools (public) recieve money from taxes. So if you're poor, you go to a poor school. If you go to a poor school you don't get accepted to college or you don't graduate, or you don't  get a good degree. If you do go to college \textbf{black} people end up with even more loans than white people. If you can't get an education and you know that you can't get a good job from a young \textbf{age} than you might turn to crime. If you do go to college and you're \textbf{black} Than you stop get stereotypes when trying to get a job. You're application can be denied simply because of a hairstyle or your name that isn't "white". Now assuming that you passed all of those barriers that are placed in you just because of your \textbf{race} and where you are born that's only education. Now let's look at the criminal justice system. 80 billion dollars spent each year on incarceration that should be spent on crime prevention, but rather it's spent on crime stopping. Because there is money and politics to be made in stopping crime, not in preventing it. That's why America spends more on prison than the next top leading 35 countries and has the highest percentage of prisoners. The prison industrial complex refers to the capitalism and literal slavery which comes from American prisons. There is no longer a need to send jobs over to sweatshops in China when prisoners will do the same work for the same amount. That's why the minimum wage doesn't count for prisoners. That's also why the war on drugs is really the war on people. Although white people use drugs at the same (sometimes higher) rate than \textbf{black} people, \textbf{black} people are arrested much more likely statistically.  This leads to the back to the issue of racial profiling and criminal quotas. When you tell people in charge that they need to have a quota of arrests in a month they arrest people for things that they could have easily let other people off with warnings on. I have personally seek people arrested for J walking just because they weren't at a cross walk. The light was \textbf{r\textbf{ed}}, they just weren't at a cross walk. Now ask yourself, would a police officer arrest me for walking across a 4 lane Street in broad daylight when there were clearly no cars around. These arrests include selling loose cigarettes, having a broken tail light, jumping a turnstile etc. These are so crimes, but these don't deserve arrests and beatings. All of the things I listed are things that most \textbf{black} people are consciously aware of all of the time. There are even events where \textbf{black} people call the police and get questioned by them as the criminal. Even cases where people were killed by the police after calling the police. \textbf{Black} people are so demonized by the police that there have been police themselves who have spoken of their gang mentality and have been demoted and removed from the force. You can even read Michael Wood, former Baltimore officer, talk about what he's seen and engaged in. There are, to this day, members of the KKK who make up the police, fire department, and no doubt, the judicial system too. White and \textbf{black} people are murder victims in nearly the same amount of crimes but 80 of the death penalties are when the victim is white. Whether you support the death penalty or not,  that's a direct bias. \textbf{Black} people get longer sentences for the same crimes and harsher trials for the same crimes. For no reason other than being born \textbf{black}, in a \textbf{black} neighborhood, or even not in a \textbf{black} neighborhood. You're more likely to be arrested and less likely to get an education. America makes money off of its criminals and so do the privatized prisons which have increased almost 5x in 35 years since they became privatized. Around the same time that crack cocaine was getting harsher sentences than powder cocaine because one was a cheap drug that \textbf{black} people could afford and white people wouldn't even get arrested for cocaine, let alone face the same time. In addition the \textbf{black} unemployment rate is twice that of white people. (I assume you understand that unemployment only counts people actively searching for jobs).  And the wage gap puts \textbf{black} men and women behind white men and women. Even worse for Hispanic people and native Americans. I could go on but frankly I could go on forever. The truth of the matter is that all of the statistics and facts go to show that \textbf{racism} is still well and alive in America and it has been since its creation. Some people still refuse to acknowledge it and think that by ignoring the problem it doesn't exist. Out of sight out of mind. Meanwhile the people who actually have to experience \textbf{racism} talk about it and white people (not all, conservatives) say things like "\textbf{racism} doesn't exist in America" meanwhile there are millions of people who are actually having to deal with \textbf{racism} and there is \textbf{nothing} more belittling than when people are trying to point out a broken system, and people who aren't affected by the system just want to ignore the problem and belittle it. So yes, it definetly does come across as \textbf{racist} when I say that there is \textbf{racism} in America and you say "Ohh well you (making this a personal attack on a person you don't know) just don't know what \textbf{racism} is, there are people in other countries who have it worse, so you should be happy in the fact that someone else is more miserable than you. I as a person who has never experienced \textbf{racism} an more than capable it speaking on \textbf{racism}, and I just wanted to tell you that although I acknowlege it's existance, you should be happy that \textbf{black} people make less money and this have to resort to the resources required to live. This isn't a reflection of America and the society at live in. This is completly due to how much you work since this is a meritocracy" you believe in the just world fallacy in America and that everybody has the same access to resources and employment.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Black, Nothing, Race, Racism, Racist, Red & \cellcolor{green!27} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Age - General, Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Ethnicity - Native-American & \cellcolor{green!27}31/1117 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.775 \\  \hline

"\textbf{Racism} consists of ideologies and practices that seek to justify, or cause, the unequal distribution of privileges, rights or goods among different racial groups. Modern variants are often based in social perceptions of biological differences between peoples. These can take the form of social actions, practices or beliefs, or political systems that consider different races to be ranked as inherently superior or inferior to each other, based on presumed shared inheritable traits, abilities, or qualities. It may also hold that members of different races should be treated differently.""...defined \textbf{racism} as a system of categorical privilege. In Portraits of White \textbf{Racism}, David Wellman defined \textbf{racism} as "culturally sanctioned beliefs, which, regardless of intentions involved, defend the advantages whites have because of the subordinated position of racial minorities".Sociologists Noël A. Cazenave and Darlene Alvarez Maddern define \textbf{racism} as "... a highly organized system of 'race'-based group privilege that operates at every level of society and is held together by a sophisticated ideology of color/'race' supremacy. Sellers and Shelton (2003) found that a relationship between racial discrimination and emotional distress was moderated by racial ideology and public regard beliefs. That is, racial centrality appears to promote the degree of discrimination \textbf{African} American young adults perceive whereas racial ideology may buffer the detrimental emotional effects of that discrimination. \textbf{Racist} systems include, but cannot be reduced to, racial bigotry,"."\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}9/300 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.0 \\  \hline

White guilt is easy due to this nations history and many institutions and government controlled media outlets indulge it because racial tension is easier then acceptance of mistakes. Indulging white guilt also serves as a buffer. Its easier to say well ethnicities cant find jobs because white people then say its because our government has made it impossible for industry to survive and cheaper to ship those jobs and opportunities to other countries. Its more convienent to miseducate and solve the issues then admit they the nixon administration signed our country to national debt and the federal reserve was easier then living up to the agreements we made with the european union and causing the financial problems we are seeing today. There are 3 foundations,grants, and programs for ethnicities for every government program that a white person is eligable for. They were built to end \textbf{racist} differences. Look at getting a higher education. There are grants and funds specifically designed and granted to anyone that isnt caucasion. Jobs? You are more eligable at getting a job because the government and public does surveys and it looks better if they hire ethnicities then caucasions because if they dont there \textbf{racist} companies who only hire whites.Look at financial aid. You are more likely to get emergency funds or financial aid if you are \textbf{immigrant} then you are if your american. Regardless of skin color our country will exempt immigrants from taxs and place them on benifits a citizen cant even apply for. This is all for the sake of ensuring an image.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small +chescaleigh No one said \textbf{racism} has gone away because of the \textbf{black} president. But using her OWN definition of \textbf{racism} = prejudice + power structure backing it up, then \textbf{racism} against white people must exist because people of other ethnicities or races do make up a substantial part of the power structure. And personally, i don't even buy that definition of \textbf{racism} - \textbf{racism} can STILL exist even if the said \textbf{ethnicity} doesn't make up the most of power structure, since local social structures can have as big an impact as a government on individuals lives. Just look what happened in my home town Rotherham in the UK, over a roughly 10 year period - 1,400 young girls were systematically raped, abused and prostituted by Pakistani heritage men and allowed to get away with it.It has been a huge scandal here because the Police force, local government and social services have had a policy of ignoring the child \textbf{sexual} abuse when it involved a white child and Asian adults, allowing it to happen for the entire 10 year period, despite countless witness reports, victims coming forwards and in some cases the police catching the rapists \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} handed with 12 year \textbf{old} girls in their bed naked (they actually arrested the girl instead).There was obviously several institutions backing this systematic abuse up, or allowing it to go unchecked: The police force, social services and the local government council. There were cover ups to avoid it all coming out to the public. Yet the institutions have a number of pakistani people within them that reflect the pakistani population of rotherham; around 10.The men involved specifically targeted white girls, partly due to their views on western women, partly due to fetishisation. The men were also allowed to get away with it BECAUSE they were Asian and their victims were white, the councils excuse was they didn't "want a contreversy and to damage sociatal cohesion with racial tension" while white pedophiles were being arrested and prosecuted. Now are you gonna tell me that these young children who have been repeatedly raped, are NOT the victim of \textbf{racism} and racial discrimination? How the hell can you define this as anything other than \textbf{racism} in it's most vile sense? They were raped specifically because they were white, the abuse was allowed to continue despite them reporting it specifically because the abusers were Asian.Yet these girls are part of the majority \textbf{ethnic} group...   The worlds a messed up confusing place in todays day and \textbf{age} and this kind of "only white people are racists" narrative is nonsense.Even going by this videos own warped view that \textbf{racism} can only = prejudice + power structure, it still falls into that definition. When you say \textbf{racism} is only possible by white people because overall society is in favour of white people, there MAY be elements of truth, but overall it's actually dangerous because then stuff like what happened in my home town happens... people of other ethnicities can CERTAINLY be \textbf{racist}, to say otherwise is pure ignorance and denial.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Black, Ethnic, Ethnicity, Old, Racism, Racist, Red, Sexual & \cellcolor{green!27} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Ethnicity - Native-American, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}18/514 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.502 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small +Albert Ciafre IQ (intelligence) is inherited and not equally distributed among humanraces. Millions of IQ tests conducted world-wide over 100 years have beennormed for every conceivable variable and bias and Blacks always rank at the bottom, even in non-verbal tests. There has never been an IQ test administered anywhere in the world where the racial rankings were different than; Ashkenazi Jews, Asians, Whites, non-White Hispanics and then American Blacks and \textbf{African} Blacks.Racial activist groups have tried to create their own tests to demonstrateintellectual parity of the races and attack the integrity of existing tests butthe rankings are always the same; \textbf{African} Blacks average a 70 IQ (only 2 of Whites score this low), American Blacks are 85 (due to mixing with Whites, 20 on average), non-White Hispanics are 87, Whites 100, Asians 106 and Ashkenazi Jews at 115. Blacks have never ranked anything other than last on any IQ test ever created.Even using culture-free, unbiased testing designed by \textbf{Black} psychologists,no amount of testing or wishful thinking shows any improvement in \textbf{Black} IQ. Raven's 'Progressive Matrices' is completely non-verbal yet even the brightest of the \textbf{African} Blacks (South \textbf{African} university students) still score only 85 -- a whole standard deviation above sub-Saharan Africa but it's also a whole standard deviation below Whites.In the United States, self-identified Blacks and Whites have been thesubjects of the greatest number of studies. They state that the \textbf{Black}-White IQ difference is about 15 to 18 points or 1 to 1.1 standard deviations which implies that between 11 and 16 percent of the \textbf{black} population have an IQ above 100 (the general population median). Consistent results were found for college and university application tests such as the Scholastic Aptitude Test and Graduate Record Examination, as well as for tests of job applicants in the corporate sector and in the military.The mean intelligence of American Blacks (who themselves are a standarddeviation above \textbf{African} Blacks due to White admixture) is much lower than for American Whites. The least intelligent ten percent of Whites have IQs below 81; forty percent of Blacks have IQs that low. Only one \textbf{Black} in six is more intelligent than the average White; five Whites out of six are more intelligent than the average \textbf{Black}. These differences show in every test of general cognitive ability that anyone, of any \textbf{race} or \textbf{nationality}, has yet been able to devise. They are reflected in countless everyday situations. 'Life is an IQ test.'Further, only one-in-3.5 million (.00003) of \textbf{African} Blacks have an IQ of140 or higher (genius level). But one-in-83 (1.2) of U.S. Whites is a genius. Therefore the per capita genius rate for U.S.-resident Whites is 41,000 times higher than it is for \textbf{African} Blacks.Incidentally, though the average IQ of East Asians is 6 points higher thanthe average non-Jewish White, the percentage distribution of East Asians with IQ's above 140 is slightly lower. The reason for this is that the range ofcognitive variation among Whites is greater than among East Asians.Specifically, Asians' IQs are more clustered around the mean. Therefore, Whites produce more geniuses, but also more morons.Psychometricians generally regard IQ tests as having high statisticalreliability. A high reliability implies that although test-takers may havevarying scores when taking the same test on differing occasions, and they may have varying scores when taking different IQ tests at the same \textbf{age}, the scores generally agree with one another and across time. Like all statistical quantities, any particular estimate of IQ has an associated standard error that measures uncertainty about the estimate. For modern tests, the standard error of measurement is about three points. Clinical psychologists regard IQ scores as having sufficient statistical validity for many clinical purposes.Standardized intelligence testing has been called one of psychology'sgreatest successes and is the field's most widely used invention. Sincestandardized tests were first used to identify learning-impaired children inthe early 1900s they have become one of the primary tools for identifyingchildren with \textbf{mental} retardation and learning disabilities, helped the U.S.military place new recruits in positions that suit their skills and abilitiesand are used for job testing. IQ scores have been shown to be associated with such factors as morbidity and mortality, parental social status, and biological parental IQ. IQ scores are used as predictors of educational achievement, special needs, job performance and income. They are also used to study IQ distributions in populations and the correlations between IQ and other variables. The scores on the SAT (especially the SAT-math) and the ACT are for all practical purposes interchangeable with IQ test scores. The same is true for other cognitive tests such as No Child Left Behind mandated state tests and NAEP tests. All of these cognitive tests show the same racial patterns in test score distribution with Ashkenazi Jews, East Asians (Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans), and Whites showing higher scores than Pacific Islanders, Native Americans, Hispanics, and Blacks showing lower scores.There is a strong correlation between IQ and success. Economists havestarted taking an interest in the value of human capital, particularly thefactor that psychologists call cognitive ability. In other words, it's theability of a person to solve a problem most efficiently. Not with violence, but by thinking. It is worth noting here that Blacks possess 10x more of thedysfunctional MAOA gene (or "warrior gene") that is associated withviolent and/or impulsive behavior.Researchers collected information on 90 countries, including far-off landsfrom the U.S. to New Zealand and Colombia to Kazakhstan. They also collected data on the country's excellence in science and technology—the number of patents granted per person and how many Nobel Prizes the country's people had won in science, for example (Blacks have never been awarded a Nobel science prize).They found that intelligence made a difference in gross domestic product.For example, some of the highest National IQs:Hong Kong 107 South Korea 106 Japan 105 Taiwan 104 Singapore 103Austria 102Germany 102 Netherlands 102 Italy 102 Austria 102 Netherlands 102Luxembourg 101 United Kingdom 100 Switzerland 101Luxembourg 101 China 100 Norway 98 Iceland 98And the lowest:Kenya 72Cameroon 70Angola 69 Cen. \textbf{African} R 68 Eritrea 68 Somalia 68Nigeria 67Haiti 67Gabon 66 Zimbabwe 66 D. Rep Congo 65Sierra Leone 64 Senegal 64 Gambia 64Liberia 64\textbf{Guinea} 63 Equat. \textbf{Guinea} 59Blacks are the only racial group with no DNA from the large-brainedNeanderthals who lived in Europe. Modern humans did not come out of Africa; the \textbf{African} humanoids came out and mated with the Neanderthals and Denisovans to create a composite hybrid that is modern man. Therefore, we do not share a \textbf{common} ancestor.Forensic scientists determine \textbf{race} by cranium shape; Blacks have a smallfrontal lobe and sloping frontal plane and a smaller cranium-to-mandible ratio. Caucasoids have the largest craniums, an almost vertical frontal \textbf{slope} and a massive frontal lobe. The mongloloid is very similar and also more evolved. It is the frontal lobe that separates our behavior most from the animals and is responsible for language and rational thought.When humans evolved from Blacks they mated with the large-brainedNeanderthals in southern Europe and created an increase in cranium capacity and a heavier, more developed brain (and pale skin, a sloped head and a single brow). At least 20 of the Neanderthal genome made its way into the 5 of human non-\textbf{Black} DNA. This is significant because there is only 1.5 difference between human and chimpanzee DNA. It is equivalent to having one Neanderthal great-great-great-grandparent. Blacks are the only \textbf{race} with no Neanderthal genes.According to studies of brain weight at autopsy, endocranial volume of empty skulls, head size measurements by the U.S. military and NASA, and two dozen MRI volumetric studies Blacks' brain size is 5 smaller than Whites, and 6 smaller than Asians. There is a correlation of brain size with IQ of about 0.40 and that these racial differences in brain size are present at birth. Larger brains contain more neurons and synapses and process information faster; by adulthood, Asians average 1 cubic inch more cranial capacity than Whites who average 5 cubic inches more than Blacks. This is a genetic trait because even malnourished Asians from poor countries have a larger brain on average than well-fed Blacks from western countries. Blacks are the only \textbf{race} without the derived form of MCPH1 microcephalin called haplogroup D which appeared about 37,000 years ago and is associated with increased brain volume.Further, this reflects what we observe in real life (including the so-called"Achievement Gap"). People have made long-term observations of thedifferent races and reached rational conclusions; the more White a society is the more prosperous, inventive and safe it is. 19 of the 20 poorest countries are sub-Saharan \textbf{African} (Haiti). In sub-Saharan Africa the only countries that could be considered successful were White-governed, (Rhodesia and S. Africa). To this day they still can't even feed themselves even though they lived alone in Africa, a vast continent with temperate climates and abundant resources, for 60,000 years. So, they cannot blame \textbf{racism}, poverty, imperialism or anything else for their failures. No pre-contact sub-Saharan \textbf{African} society ever created a written language, weaved cloth, invented the wheel or plow, or devised a calendar or system of measurement or complex math (arithmetic, algebra or geometry), built a multi-story structure, bridge or road or railway or ship, domesticated animals, exploited underground natural resources nor produced anything that could be considered a mechanical device until White colonizers did it for them.IQ distribution by \textbf{race}/ethnicity:• Ashkenazi Jews = 115• East Asians = 106• Whites = 100• South East Asians = 87• Non-White Hispanics = 86• American Blacks = 85 (average 20 White mix)• Middle East and North Africans = 84• Sub-Saharan Blacks = 67 (Only 2 of Whites score this low)• Australian Aborigines = 62Blacks have the lowest IQ of any \textbf{race} because they are the only \textbf{race} with no DNA from the large-brained Neanderthal who lived in Europe. Europeans have about 6 Neanderthal DNA, Asians also have about 4 Denisovan DNA. This is what caused the dramatic increase in cranium capacity (and brain size as MRIs reveal), brain function and nervous system development as humans evolved from Blacks and migrated out of Africa.It is worth noting that some groups succeed all the time, everywhere. Some have never succeeded anywhere. Blacks are the oldest \textbf{race} so they should be expected to be the most advanced, but they have never been successful anywhere. Civilization didn't advance until humans evolved from Blacks by merging with the large-brain Neanderthals.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African, Age, Black, Common, Guinea, Mental, Nationality, Race, Racism, Slope & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Nationality - Chinese, Nationality - General, Nationality - Italian, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}31/1786 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.736 \\  \hline

Neonazis in America don't have much political power, but they're still \textbf{racist} none the less. Also, academic studies are subject to change; it was no more than a century ago that it was academically accepted that whites were evolutionarily superior to blacks, and now we know thats not the case.

Thing is, \textbf{racism} has a lot to do with the culture we're brought up in, and with white people growing up to believe in things about minorities that either aren't true or painted in broad strokes, the same thing happens to minorities and their beliefs in white people, because, yeah, \textbf{racism} is very much an institutional thing and no one is really immune to it.Also, if we're going to go by the "\textbf{Racism} is Prejudice+Power" definition, then Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe is probably one of the most \textbf{racist} people on the planet for his discrimination against white minorities living in his country.And also with the white caricature, imagine if a white person were to paint his face \textbf{black}, wear a dew rag, fake gold teeth, and speak in ebonics to help justify his arguments of crime rates in urban areas; even if that white person were to make good points in his discussion, the fact that he's using such an offensive racial stereotype as his strawman pretty much defeats any justifications he has and people will most likely get turned off by anything he says.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I take issue with the sociological definition of \textbf{racism}.The Power part of that equation is complete binary.In this case white people have power, poc don't. Your reasoning being that the people with power only face person to person prejudice but no institutional oppression, one of those examples being poc facing longer prison sentences for the same crime. This is were it gets interesting:The sociological defintion of \textbf{sexism} also defines it as prejudice + power, which translates to men have the power, women don't. Men can only experience prejudice, but not \textbf{sexism}.You would therefore expect that women experience the same institutional oppression. However, the opposite is true in the examples you mentioned.Women are the majority of the electorate. Men get longer prison sentences than women for the same crime. Given the same qualifications, women are twice as likely to be hired in STEM fields. Women are preferred tenants in most apartments.It's painfully obvious that this definition of power or no power fails to capture reality.Much the same is true for the sociological definition of \textbf{racism}. Power isn't binary, not on an invidual level or in a broader context.The only way to even somewhat quantify power would be based on money, in which case it should be worth noting that Asians have higher average earnings than \textbf{black}, latino and white people.I'm not saying that white men are the biggest victims of \textbf{racism} and \textbf{sexism}, That's obviously quite ridiculous. I'm saying that the sociological definition based on power doesn't hold up to scrutiny.Power isn't \textbf{black} and white.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Birdie Wolf How exactly are women discouraged from learning about stem fields? The opposite is true. There are tons of programmes that actively try to get women into stem fields, particularly physics, engineering and computer science. But they don't work because most women aren't interested in those fields. Mind you, that's not true for every science subject. Women make up the majority of Chemistry and Biology majors and have for years and years. So what are you saying? Women are discriminated against in Enginerring, but not in Chemistry? That's ridiculousRegarding the voting, what the hell are you on about with "new social attitude that discourage..."? That is pretty much the vaguest thing you could base your definition of power on. This was in reponse to "white people have the institutional powers that validate them saying \textbf{racist} things" without a given explanation. So I guessed that's by the virtue of being the majority of the eloctorate. I didn't say women are the majority of the eloctorate to prove that they have the power. I said it to illustrate that being the majority doesn't necessairly grant you power.And you've never heard of women being preferred tenants? Where do you live? While looking for a place in Berlin about a third of the ads said women only. I never came across an apartment that said men only. And this is explicitly stated in the ads, where as the housing discrimination against \textbf{black} people is worded very vaguely in this video.And please stop with the \textbf{patriarchy} bullshit. \textbf{Patriarchy} theory is a radical feminist idea that isn't taken seriously by anyone outside of that bubble. And again, if men have the power in a \textbf{patriarchy}, but receive longer prison sentences, then I guess \textbf{black} people receive longer prison sentences as a negative side effect of living in a Melarchy.And even if the top 1 were exlusively white, what power does that grant the average white person in the US?Even if the top 1 were exclusively men, what power does that grant to the average man in the US?Unless you automatically assume that these evil white men make decisions not based on money, but to actively try to make it harder for women and minorities.And you seem to have missed my point entirely. Yes, \textbf{racism} and \textbf{sexism} are very different. However the premise of these sociological definitions is the same. Saying that a certain race/sex is superior is \textbf{racist}/sexist. To suggest that's it's not \textbf{racist}/sexist, as long as the person saying it is "oppressed" enough, is ridiculous.

A lot of the people perpetuating this theory leave us with no solution, so yes we know \textbf{racism} exists and even at a institutional level which are made up of individuals.

Like I can notice you have blue eyes, but I don't make assumptions about who you are based on the fact your eyes are blue. \@xelaraque Women are twice as likely to be hired in STEM fields because of the lack of women in STEM fields. You say that, but STEM is still a very male dominated field because women were discouraged from learning about math and science.  And yes women are the majority of the electorate, but is there some sort of institution that is stopping men from voting? This is a real question. Is there a new social attitude that discourages men from voting,  are their campaigns that encourage women to vote, and none that include men? Also is this reflected on a local level? And I have never heard about \textbf{gender} housing discrimination, so please feel free to provide more information regarding this. I do agree that \textbf{sexism} isn't so easily defined because it does effect both genders. The \textbf{patriarchy} relies on the image that men are strong, aggressive, rational, unemotional, etc. The negative affects is that men are seen as more dangerous than women, and are treated as such. Like with the harsher prison sentences. Anyway my actual point is the say that \textbf{racism} and \textbf{sexism} are two very different things, with different issues. Just because the definition doesn't work for \textbf{sexism} does not mean it doesn't work of \textbf{racism}. If there are issues with it, use examples that pertain to \textbf{racism}.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Thanks +Terietta M. Ingram and +Dre TorelliI wasn't trying to suggest that she never tried to clarify true "\textbf{racism}" (which was mostly what the video was about). But still, saying "Good people can unintentionally say and do \textbf{racist} things" (1:27) or "Good people can say \textbf{racist} things" (1:42) is still calling people and their actions  words "\textbf{racist}".My point is still that labeling people and their actions  words as "\textbf{racist}" is a divisive attack on others who may  honestly have no ill will towards people of other \textbf{ethnic} backgrounds.I think she was more on target to this point from 1:47-2:10 and particularly at 2:00 where she mentioned "impact" vs "intent". (Though I think she has it backwards and "intent" is the key factor. Some people are very \textbf{thin} skinned and CHOOSE to get "offended" to a degree that's not warranted for certain situations.) I think about the R-Word the same as Levar Burton referred to the use of the N-Word during the same named CNN special with Don Lemon: "Don, is not the words themselves, but what is the intent that is being used behind the words that we use?""Good people" can unintentionally say or do things out of ignorance of how they might be perceived. Other "good people" might even be insensitive enough that they don't utilize caution regarding the use of their words or actions.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Newd InFl you're getting confused. You don't actually have to have hateful intent to perpetuate systems of \textbf{racism}.Individualized \textbf{racism} (the dictionary definition) has this as a main factor, but not systemic \textbf{racism} (the sociology definition.)Those micro aggressions are \textbf{racist} because they perpetuate \textbf{racism}, although the intention wasn't aimed at this, this was the effect, this was what it does. It is \textbf{racist} if it in any way, shape, or form, perpetuates \textbf{racism}.Merely identifying this fact, is not what is divisive. What is divisive is that people who think that you do or say something that perpetuates \textbf{racism}, that makes you a bad person and then react to that assumption, that's what's divisive. But merely expressing that \textbf{racist} actions and words, etc are things that perpetuate \textbf{racism}...and then progressing to explain why it's not okay to do these things anymore and how it helps bring us all together to fight oppression, that's not divisive.It is impact OVER intent. It doesn't matter as much what you meant to do, because the simple fact is... you did not do it. And what happened from you failing to not do or say the \textbf{racist} thing, is more significant than what you meant to do. Understand? Impact over intent.The word \textbf{racist} isn't an attack in this situation. The word \textbf{racist} is a fact.If you are perpetuating \textbf{racism} you are a \textbf{racist}.That does not mean you hate anyone. It doesn't mean you go out burning crosses and killing people.

Your confusion is coming from interpreting words that aren't there.I never said "hateful" nor do I think Franchesca said "hateful intent". But simply "intent".  And there in lies the problem. Assuming "hatred" is always involved with less than perfect situations involving people of different \textbf{ethnic} backgrounds leads to the incorrect labeling of the situations as "\textbf{racist}".  Take a moment the next time you want to label something or someone as "\textbf{racist}". Picture all the parties involved being of the same \textbf{race} or, more important, reverse the races of those involved. Do you automatically assume "hatred" is involved if they're all of the same \textbf{race}?

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Indeed, you hit the nail on the head. In his celebrated little book, On Liberty, the English philosopher John Stuart Mill argued that silencing an opinion is 'a peculiar evil'. If the opinion is right, we are robbed of the 'opportunity of exchanging error for truth'; and if it's wrong, we are deprived of a deeper understanding of the truth in 'its collision with error'. If we know only our own side of the argument, we hardly know even that; it becomes stale, soon learned only by rote, untested, a pallid and lifeless truth.Mill also wrote, 'If society lets any considerable number of its members grow up as mere children, incapable of being acted on by rational consideration of distant motives, society has itself to blame.' Jefferson made the same point even more strongly: 'If a \textbf{nation} expects to be both ignorant and free in a state of civilization, it expects what never was and never will be.' In a letter to Madison, he continued the thought: 'A society that will trade a little liberty for a little order will lose both, and deserve neither.'\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nation & \cellcolor{green!27}Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/186 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.538 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Tahir Register I would beg to differ. A child learns by mimicking, a child is vulnerable and their mirror neurons teach them critical environmental adaptations, trusting that their parents are informed enough about the world, having made it far enough to procreate, to teach a child how to survive. A child has no defenses against the pervasive White Supremacy surrounding it and as such has no need to do anything but exist within that space in order to imbibe white supremacist thought. What often counteracts that (and wasn't available when \textbf{racism} was at its most violent) is the media which is also an educator and a vital part of an upbringing. This is has helped to inform other people and makes your teachers a little less \textbf{racist}, helps to cast doubt on your upbringing and brings new evidence to light to reshape \textbf{racist} opinions. \textbf{Racism} and white supremacist thought requires unwilling participation for many of us, proposing false premises and bad information with which to then interpret the world. We have to consciously unlearn these things and then teach our children the true nature of reality. And putting conscious participation as the prime example of \textbf{racism} is what has caused our problems today. People think that just because no one is burning a cross or lynching that \textbf{racism} is dead. Until White Supremacy is dismantled as much as possible and we see class and culture reflecting a more equal distribution of wealth and influence, we can't pretend that this problem is not something infecting ALL of our minds.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}6/258 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.326 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Racism is a system of prejudice that bases itself on skin color AND power. When you speak about power, and the benefit of power, you're more likely talking discrimination and \textbf{racism} has a stronger definition when you look at it from a discrimination basis. Discrimination can be individual, institutional or systemic. \textbf{Racism} is all three.Ethnicism is a system of prejudice that evaluates people on their \textbf{ethnicity}. It's not the same as \textbf{racism}. Say White English hating on, say, white Jews, is likely ethnicism and religious prejudice. (White Jews being a white minority) And \textbf{Ethnicity} can be, but is not always regional. Korean, Hokkien and Han Chinese... or Igbo and Yoruba in Nigeria. (Just a note that not all people who live in Europe are white and that's never been the case...)Someone PoC hating on their own \textbf{race} for skin color, giving into \textbf{racism}, is colorism or shadism, but this lacks the same kind of power that \textbf{racism} does, and in the end most likely benefits white people. The exception to this is the Taoist texts, which were more about the suppression of women than \textbf{race} and color, though this certainly could and has amplified under systems of \textbf{racism} spread overseas.Japanese hating on Koreans, for example is ethnicism, not \textbf{racism}. They might be discriminatory based on this-ism, but it's not the same as \textbf{racism}.And hatred because of religion, etc, is not \textbf{racism}, which is why the video also falls short a bit. White people try to often conflate all types of discrimination is \textbf{racism}, when it's not.Unlike other prejudices, \textbf{racism}, according to most social sciences and history has a rough time stamp of being invented and for socio-economic reasons, which BTW, makes it convenient to study prejudice under to see how prejudice works and eventually becomes systemic and institutional discrimination.This does not mean that PoCs can't dislike or hate on white people or be prejudiced.And the way that white people think and talk about \textbf{race} tends to be far more limited than PoCs talk about it. That way tends to get taught to the next generation accidentally, which perpetuates the system. This includes that \textbf{racism} is only individual, rather than institutional and systemic.\textbf{Ethnic} studies 101.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnic, Ethnicity, Race, Racism & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}19/372 & \cellcolor{green!5}5.108 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I am very thankful that there are videos and sources like this that help us all understand \textbf{racism}.

Where the hell do you get that idea from? Your outrage that Latinos and India's celebrate that someone of their same cultural backgrounds won Miss America.  I am of neither of their groups, but i am still happy for them. Yes America is suppose to be diverse so it shouldnt always be white people winning. So yes lets celebrate when a non traditional person wins. YOu should be celebrating to. ITs reflecting America becoming the melting pot we were originally designed to be.   It doesn't bother me but the key words are "STARTED AT A TIME WHEN \textbf{BLACK} FOLKS WERE EXCLUDED" But you're not excluded anymore and now makes it feel like you are excluding us. Do you understand? I'm not saying that you are, well I am and we certainly feel excluded! You of all people should know how this feels!So now that we have been included should we just give up on our \textbf{black} organizations? Give up on our traditions that we created when we werent allowed to be included?  Yes we are allowed to participate but why should we have to.? There are some benefits received when you belong to a cultural organization that you have have to give those up?  We see value in that.  Why dont you?  So is it okay for Italians to still celebrate some traditions that their families brought from Italy? Should there not be an Celtic league of America?  Should my little cousin stop learning traditional Mexican dancing bc she is America now? \textbf{Nobody} ever said that you didn't deserve equality because of your skin color! You are forming your own assumptions and this is why you cant see eye to eye. You already believe what you want to. You are puting words in my mouth because I never made a notion to suggest such a thing! that's absurd!This is again bc everytime I mention cultural unity you say "no it cant be all one group".  You are denying me the benefits I get from being around people who share a similar background.  That doesnt mean that i am not around people who dont share a similiar background..  You seem to view these things as a threat. What benefits would  you as white person gain from participating in a \textbf{black} organization? You can certainly join, I have never met one that excludes white people.  Even then AME Church let that \textbf{terrorist} in with open arms  and he killed them.  The goal of \textbf{black} organization is to uplift and address issues w/n the \textbf{black} community.Do you feel like minorities in this country dont have specific issues they have to face?I will ask you again.

This is \textbf{common} sense sweet heart!! If you cant see it I dont know what to tell you!The goal of all of these organizations are not to exclude others.  Its to focus on one particular group.  Do you not feel that FOC have specific issues they need to address?? Only white organizations have excluded people of color. It has never happened the other way around. Even the most extreme \textbf{black} groups have white members and Allies. LMAO! So you want to be seen as equal and are seen as being equal by MAJORITY of white people like myself but dont want to join us. Really! WOW that fucking pompous!I didnt say we didnt want to, I said should we have to?  Are we not allowed to be equal but different?  You seem to say that equality means we all have to be the same. So the question becomes who decides what the same is? Should Jewish folks have to give up their cultural groups? I have asked you several questions to how you feel on other groups and their cultural organizations. You dont express your opinion on those.  Only \textbf{black} folks who cant be allowed to have our own cultural groups.Again what is white America culture? What about the Celtic League?Or the Irish American leagues? Should they not be allowed to exist? Yes white people are damaged by prejudice. Absolutely hate crimes can happen to anyone.  But \textbf{racism} benefits white people as whole. You are done. That is what I expect of a coward.I will not be moved by a desperate man who is holding on to the relic of the past.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Okay, I know your talking about things from an American perspective, but I'm curious about how that correlation between \textbf{race} and power works when you take into account class.In the UK you can have swaiths of white people (most notably skin-head extreme right-wingers) who say lots of things based on racial prejudiced against \textbf{black}, eastern European, Islamic groups but they as a group (as a class) don't even come close to having any kind of power over these groups. Unless you count abusive power like fighting and ganging up.This really worries me because it means we can't term these people \textbf{racist}. More so it highlights a chasm of difference between the UK's and the USA's paradigmatic notion of \textbf{racist} behavior. The assumption that being white means being related to power is just one that doesn't apply in the UK, at least as well to being (in the UK's definition) being middle-class or upper-class and being powerful.Yet we still have \textbf{racism} here, but the power dynamics are warped and bent if we take power into account. Maybe that's OK - maybe the UK and the USA need two very different conceptions of \textbf{race} and \textbf{racism}. Maybe that points to a flaw in the correlation of \textbf{race} and power (at least how power is assumed to transmit along racial lines, such as being white). Or, maybe I'm just missing something.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Race, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}8/231 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.463 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@bruno Hey Bruno, thanks for responding. This youtube channel is for MTV USA so it has no obligation or authority to speak about racial divides in other countries - especially because other people are already addressing it elsewhere. I highly recommend Cecile Emeke's "Strolling" and "FLaner" series as well as Hairunruled's series "Pretty" for \textbf{black} identity in Europe perspectives. These are conversations with people of colour living in Europe and how the perceive the world differently. No one has denied the differences in racial politics. And while I understand the class issues of the UK to a certain extent, brought to a height in the early Industrial \textbf{Age}, it is merely an aspect of what human valuation does to various groups. Whiteness has extended over time to include various groups that previously were not considered so. But it is still an ethnocentrism that only see humanity and value in likeness, in in-group factors. This then branches out to \textbf{racism} in a very ugly way when you have a convenient marker for discrimination. The UK's class issues and feudal mentality has always been a precursor to \textbf{racism}. It was a driving factor because here you didn't have to do any pesky work to examine clothes, mannerisms and manner of speaking before knowing if you were better than somebody, you merely had to look at their face. Eventually the distinction between the Irish, Northerners and poor whites versus POC became wider because you had a convenient underclass that would pass it on to their children and just announce their inferiority into eternity. How nice. It is all interlinked and one does not forgive or eliminate the other - one further entrenches the other. It's all about the valuation of life as more or less worthwhile based on accidents of birth. It's all wrong, but it's not all equally damaging. And one group can still inflict harm on another despite both being on the lower end of society.However, I doubt we're disagreeing about anything here :)\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Black, Racism & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}4/334 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.198 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@AleyaMusic Hi Aleya, thanks for you response.First let me claify, I'm talking in a contemporary sense and though we can't ignore the atrocities of colonialism - and indeed when we talk of modern \textbf{racism} we have to take colonialism into account. We can't begin to understand the place of Pakistani people, or \textbf{Indian} people in the UK without the tool of post-colonialism.Also let me say that class in the UK isn't just money. It's identity, deep rooted. In fact I would say it resembles a 'Caste' in India than the USA's notion of class. Put this another way - Robbie Williams and David Beckham are both working class people, despite the fact they have millions of pounds. I hope that makes sense.With those point in mind because I didn't make them that clear in my first comment, I'm not talking about poverty or being poor. I'm talking about class identity's intersection with \textbf{race}. We have \textbf{racism} - we do, I'd be the first to admit that - but, that's not what I'm trying to criticise. I'm trying to narrowly ask the question of the conflation between power and \textbf{race} is a functional dynamic to understand \textbf{racism} outside of the USA (or 'new world' countries).I don't believe that lower class Brits see themselves in the 'same group' of politicians or people with power. This has added emphasis when we take Wales and Scotland into account, but its the middle-classes, the south, Londoners that have the power. Yes there is a dynamic of \textbf{race} and power if we consider two middle-class people that are white and an \textbf{ethnic} minority. But, that's by the by.The UK has a troubling history of 'white supremacy' but it's not the 'whiteness' that makes the 'white man' supreme. It's the middle-class features of the man - his literacy, his involvement with law, his religiosity, his church, his queen and country, his empire on his map in his drawing room. One only has to look to the work houses, prohibition movements, 'charities', conception of poor life that lead to a call for the 'edification of in the working class' in the 1800s that ran alongside colonialism to see that there is a hell of a difference. If it wasn't for labour and the trade unionists the brutalities against the working class, the north, wales and Scotland would have been much worse and lasted much longer - not to mention the 1st World War and 'lions led by donkeys'. The foot soldiers were often middle-class kids come out of Sandhurst, because the working classes in the \textbf{Black} Country, in Wales, in the North were in the mines digging up the coal to run the empire of the middle class, so they could feed there kids. Look at how UKIP is gaining power - it is a middle-class 'empowering' a un-powered working people to be against immigration and instilling \textbf{racism}.So consequently, the correlation between \textbf{race} and power that is comfortable in an American setting becomes, in light of this, much more troubling and complex.What does this mean for \textbf{racism} in the UK? Well it's very different from the USA. All Asian (in a british context this means middle eastern, as opposed to far eastern or \textbf{Indian} which would fall into a different category because language) or \textbf{Black} British people account for 7, whereas Latino and \textbf{Black} people make up nearly 30 of the American population. This means that issues of \textbf{race} are focused around cities - particularly London. It also means (especially when you consider the impact of post-colonial immigrants to the UK from Africa and Jamaica) that \textbf{black} identity isn't defined by slavery in the same way as in the states. This, I want to clarify doesn't mean that Slavery isn't an important historical thing to address, it just filters into British society differently. So the American power dynamic between 'white slave owner - \textbf{Black} slave' is either not present or completely re-figured. So British racial issues are for the most part tied up with immigration, Islamophobia, against white eastern Europeans and gypsies. These aren't necessarily power related issues. Yes, we still have a disproportionate amount of representation in the commons but again, that way of measuring power is a very American democratic tool, and doesn't account for local politics. And because our minority  is much lower the disparity is less. The difference between 5 of non-white representatives and 12 of non-whites, or even the previously mentioned 7 of Asian and \textbf{Black} British (the two most deprived groups), is a heck of a difference from the power differential between a nearly 90 white congress with a 30 non-white population. So when you measure 'Prime Ministers' by racial standards - even if there was perfect representation and ignoring all other contributing factors such as serving on the cabinet, shadow cabinet, publicity, relationship to previous PMs- you would have a 1 in 10 chance of having a minority leader. That's not to say we shouldn't support minority MPs not at all, but we have a different history, ethnography and domestic interpersonal relationship with ourselves to understand \textbf{racism} through.This leads me to my concluding point. Britain has \textbf{racism}, it would be absurd and morally dubious to deny that. But Britain (and so to the rest of the world, especially Europe) needs to understand \textbf{racism} on its own terms, with its own history, with its own ethnography, with the impact it has on its people. America has dominated the discussion of \textbf{race} - and for good outcomes, and for a good results. But we need to start realising that these assumptions that we make about \textbf{racism} that apply so easily, usefully and brilliantly in an American setting don't simply apply across the pond. The relationship between \textbf{race} and power is one such example - we need to be more nuanced in terms of our history, our society. It's so easy to assume because we share a language the UK is just an America further east, or vice versa. But we have very very different ways of seeing the world (and that's great!), and our social justice systems and arguments both coming from America to a global audience, and to the UK from a global meeting point, need to recognise and be able to have the tools to adjust accordingly. We need to be more relativistic about \textbf{race}, give more voices to people of colour in our country, and see the nuances of being non-american.I'll leave with this amazing quote from Akala, south London rap artist whom I adore. \textbf{Racism} exists, but it intersects and needs to be understood along with the broad, deep and dynamic history of Class and the affects of classicism.But in reality you have more in \textbf{common} with immigrants ,Than with your leaders I know, both side of my family \textbf{Black} and white are fed ghetto mentality Reality in this system, Poor people are dirt regardless of shade But with that said, Let's not pretend that everything is the same- Fire in the Booth, Akala\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Common, Ethnic, Indian, Race, Racism & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Ethnicity - Native-American, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}29/1178 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.462 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@chescaleigh Thanks for the reply!Ohh, I completely agree. But Class in the UK isn't just poverty and I mean in a much broader sense, it connects with Welsh, Scottish, \textbf{Black} Country, Northen, your accent, being a Labourite, Anti-thacherism (the list could go on). I mentioned in my reply to Aleya below that rich people retain their class identity regardless of their income. And yes, Islamic groups or any BME groups don't hold power in the UK. At the moment a complete prick known as David Cameron does, and the Conservative party doesn't really hold up as 'giving a voice to the marginalised'. When we talk of \textbf{racism} in the UK though we need to be much more mindful about post-colonialism - particularly with Pakistan, India and the middle east. It forms the historical backdrop for the UK's involvement with Afaganistan and Iraq and gives it a bitter taste. So when we talk of Islamic groups living in the UK or \textbf{black} British identity it ties into working class identity, that has its own problems and relations but works into an already de-powerlising system. The consequence is often when you have unempowered working class people, turning against unempowered BME people by the empowered middle-classes (who tend to be and almost always are white like Nigel Farrage, though are not necessarily white,  - Sajid Javid in David Cameron's cabinet, for example). You then have two groups without power fighting each other. There is no institutional change going on, neither has the power to do anything, community relations are flaring and the people in power don't care so long as each group keeps the other busy.Maybe this is particularly true with a conservative government at the moment, I don't know. But the relationship between your \textbf{race} and your power has to take into account your other fundamental identities, if it is to function as a paradigm to help solve the issues in the UK. Lack of access to good schooling is not so much an issue in the UK, because of the size of the place. OK Eton and Cheltenham ladies college are full of white or Asian/far eastern very rich Kids, but most secondary comprehensives aren't. They have a proportional mix of white and BME kids. Outside London especially. Then when you take faith schools like Islamic and Church of England schools into account things become more complex too because of the relationship between religion and faith. Housing discrimination is something that is social and the UK has a housing crisis. All working class people are finding it difficult to get housing, especially social housing at the moment because there isn't enough housing full stop. Does this means that BME people find it more difficult to find housing - maybe? I'm not sure. That sounds like it would be a very difficult issue to asses as all housing needs are controlled by local government, and should be impartial. In fact you could probably request a different worker if you felt like you were being discriminated against a characteristic protected by the 2010 equalities act, such as \textbf{race}.So yes, I completely agree with you (for what my agreement is worth), in terms of \textbf{racism} in the UK. But I think that the we need to see the nuances between British (indeed any country that's not the USA) and the problems of \textbf{race} in that country. We need to fix them, but we need to realise to understand them we understand the dynamics away from an american racial dynamic. But I think British social justice can be lazy and rely to heavily on American ideas - especially considering how easily these materials transverse the globe online.Before I actually click the reply button, a story an North American friend shared with me when she first came to the UK and we had a conversation similar to this. "I was amazed," she told me "When I came here, all your service works, constructions workers, taxi drivers, low wage workers were white". The fact she noticed this difference so strongly I think points to the different structures between class and \textbf{race} in the UK. We need to understand what those structure are and how the function, in order to fix inequality and work out what it all means in a racial dynamic.But, that's my tuppence on the subject sorry if I droned on. Thanks again for your reply, I think your videos are not only amazing, and I love to use your ideas to spin off my own thought on these subjects.

Groups like the English Defense League (though now disbanded) are damaging, though probably equally damaging to white eastern Europeans and Islamic groups. Thanks for the recommendations though, and please look up the south London rap scene. It's amazing in terms of putting stories and BME people to experiences in London - it's also very different from American rap which can be interesting too as I enjoy both.We have a troubling history with working class identity, and we still don't know what to do with it. But, Jeremy Corbyn who is a Socialist who will hopefully take over our left wing Party 'Labour' looks like these issues might finally get the response and time they deserve.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@B1GS1V Mhm, because you are just supposed to sit there and let them decide whether or not they feel like killing you. Because when its just you and the gunman, and there is \textbf{nobody} else around, it's really their choice whether you live or die, not yours. But that aside, how was Trayvon supposed to know that the man was armed until he pulled out the gun anyway? When the autopsy came back, they couldn't find traces of his DNA on Zimmerman's gun. Which means that he was probably shot before he knew one existed, because most people in that situation would probably try to take the gun from the other person's hands. IF they knew beforehand that one existed.It's not wrong, you just missed the point. The fact of the matter is when people who know what they are doing/have authority over you tell you not to do something, you don't do it. End of story. And I will not stop defending Trayvon. Not until you stop defending that trigger-happy barbarian. Also, to answer your 2nd question, there is no way that Zimmerman could have known what Trayvon was going to do, which is another reason why his deliberately ignoring the dispatcher on the line was stupid. Unless you yourself are armed and can defend yourself in a worst-case scenario, I don't see why anyone with a brain would go up and approach a suspicious-looking stranger at night time. ESPECIALLY after being told by police to just not. do. anything.I understand perfectly well what self DEFENSE is. But we do not know who threw the 1st punch for sure. There were no witnesses who were able to clarify that information 100. All they could say was that they heard and saw a fight going on, but no one could say for sure who started it, why it was started, or exactly how it played out. So whose to say that Trayvon wasn't acting in self-defense? Let me remind you that 1.) Trayvon is dead and can't account for his side of the story 2.) There was not enough evidence to prove that Zimmerman's claims were false. He could have said anything. That case in particular was extremely one-sided. It is very hard to defend a dead person in court, especially when there are no real witnesses. But I'm not even going to go into that. Because Zimmerman was in the wrong from the get go the second he left his car : At least if he hadn't done that, then Trayvon would probably have still been alive. But he's not. So you cannot convince me since he's gone and Zimmerman isn't that he wasn't the victim.

And yes, I absolutely expect people to stay in their cars if the police tells them too, DUH. Just like you would be obligated to do what they say if they tell you to get OUT of your car. The police are the authority figures. You seem to be missing the basic principle that when the authorities tell you not to do something, you don't do it. I don't understand why that concept is so hard to grasp for you. And while there is no legal punishment for getting out of your car and walking around, there IS legal punishment for getting out of your car to stalk and ultimately shoot a person. Again I say, DUH. The evidence presented showed that 1.) Trayvon had not touched the gun 2.) There was no blood on his knuckles 2.) There was none of Zimmerman's DNA underneath his fingertips. It DOES matter who started the altercation, because if it had been Zimmerman, that would have made him the aggressor in this case and Trayvon would be the one on the defensive. Again I say, DUH. You can't cherry pick which evidence is/is not relevant and use it to justify whatever \textbf{crazy} idealized scenario you've got dancing around in your imagination.
