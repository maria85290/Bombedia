I see we have political power due to our numbers and our voice. We must advocate for our community's rights.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I am 64 as of yesterday April 29 th when you published this video Margaret! Kind of coincidental don't you think? Haha. I have to admit, I paused before adding my \textbf{age} just now. It was more difficult than I thought. I really don't have a problem being 64 , it's looking 64 that I have difficulty with! I have recently joined the ' going grey gracefully ' gang and am happy with that decision. But I was in a store with my 23 year \textbf{old} son the other day and the sales assistant asked him if I was his ' Gramma'! I didn't take it to heart though especially as she wasn't much younger than me and was rather silly, the type of person who speaks before they think. Anyway, not to worry. Thanks again Margaret for another very interesting topic. ❤\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}2/143 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.399 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I turned 75 a few weeks ago.  I've been enjoying life more every years since I retired at \textbf{age} 52.  I please myself!  If I want to let the housework pile up, I just do.  If I feel like doing spring cleaning in November, I just do.  If I want a meal at 2 in the afternoon, I just do.  I am so free, so happy, so self-indulgent after being a parent, a homemaker, an employee.  Now I am just myself.  I often feel that I've reclaimed the self I was before puberty.  Now my body isn't my main focus - I can let my wrinkles show, I can wear what I please.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small You mentioned the advertising agencies are run by men. If you look deeply at who is managing and who they are hiring to design ads, you will discover that the advertising agencies are people in their 30s and 40s. While talking to many of them, I learn that they still think 'retirement' is unplanned and people playing shuffleboard. They may have parents in their 60s and 70s, but they still have a very \textbf{old} fashioned notion of what it looks like to be in our 60s and 70s.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small dear margaret, i am 62. i have a story, i'll try to be brief. five or so years back my husband and i were on a \textbf{hike}. after a few hours nearing the peak, he set up his tripod and camera and walked into the frame, using the self timer. this would not seem unusual but it was. for 20 years i was positioned in every photograph, always from the back and i knew, only as a way to show perspective of the landscape shots he took. this was a first. i asked what had just happened. (please understand i never cared one bit about being in the photos, i always knew i was just a prop and he had a job to do).he said he was only doing what his editor requested. they wanted young and fit. after overcoming the shock i became angry and hurt. wth! as we continued on our \textbf{hike} i noticed the few people we met on the trail were all around our \textbf{age}. on so many levels this was unacceptable and my anger grew. (as he continued to photograph himself while i stood aside) were we not to be recognized as healthy, fit, older adults, active and enjoying the outdoors too? i wanted to know which magazine he meant, i planned write to them. i did do that. and never did hear back. (is a popular well known publication) last year my husband left our marriage for a much younger \textbf{woman}. ironically, as invisible he (and supposedly the magazine) made me feel, i've been asked to model for two company's this last year, now that i'm on my own. even though it's different and way out of my comfort zone to face the camera, i said yes. long silvering hair and wrinkles, made from mostly smiles now...and a growing confidence that \textbf{age} doesn't change my value, these are my best assets. your message is so important. we have to believe in ourselves, at every \textbf{age}. that's what matters most. lori x\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Hike, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Gender - General, Nationality - Italian & \cellcolor{green!5}6/338 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.775 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Great message Margaret. Your necklace today is my favorite I've seen you in. You look wonderful. I'm entering the last few years of my 60s .\textbf{Ageism} is a thing. Some cultures do respect their elders but not mine unfortunately. Maturity \& wisdom usually only comes with \textbf{age}. Being ourselves is the best way to disrupt \textbf{ageism}. I'm finding myself not due to being a "\textbf{senior} " but due to having time as a retiree due to illness. Battling an incurable disease can change your perspective. That's what's slowed me down but the gift of time I'm trying to use well. Each new day is an opportunity. I can't say I look my \textbf{age} as I've been told I look much younger all my adult life; it's genetics. As my dermatologist says, thank your parents. I get to reflect on my life as well as that of my ancestors. I'm not someone whose ever hid her \textbf{age}. Turning 67 is a gift.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Thank you, Margaret, for another great youtube broadcast ! I am 66 years \textbf{old}. Honestly, I have never thought of myself as \textbf{old} until recently. I  retired and found myself watching day time television.  Spot on regarding the advertising !  Tuning out from the negative messaging.  I have never had any problem with cross generational relationships.  I learn from older people, younger people, and I have a lot of wisdom to share.  Agree, advertising is not the real world.  I'll choose Sixty and Me over the advertising con game.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I am 66 and get very confused about people's reactions to me. I feel good at this stage of my life. I raised my 3 very wonderful children as a single parent and always have been very independant and strong.  I am trying to make changes to insure that I will be able to be self sufficient in my future years. It can be very sad and overwhelming sometimes to give up or let go of our past. Changes are not easy. I find that aging is about adjusting to changes in our life. Readjusting our thought process about our future. I do not feel \textbf{old}. Until others treat me like they think I am. I do not color my hair anymore and my hair is mostly white which troubles many people. I wear my hair in a style that is considered too long for my \textbf{age} but I have news for them it's going to get longer. I travel and drive wherever I want to with no one restricting me. I have more freedom than I have at any stage in my life.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}2/184 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.087 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I am doing the same thing with my hair! I am 62, and I don't care what other people think about my hair. I've had comments about how I should not let my hair grow long, "that's for young girls". I don't feel \textbf{old}.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I like the idea of saying our \textbf{age} with pride. I'm 66!  One of the best things I did was cancelling my basis TV pkg. years ago.

Sometimes look at mags in my library instead.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/46 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.174 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Hi Margaret, I'm 61 and loving the freedom I have at this time in my life. 😊I can remember my mother at this \textbf{age} and the clothes and hair styles society expected of her.Things have certainly changed for the better. My hair is longer than it has ever been. I buy my clothes in all manner of shops, not just the ‘old lady' clothing stores and I revel in experiencing new things.Great topic, thanks for starting this conversation.Cheers from Australia.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/84 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.19 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I love the concept that my \textbf{age} is a sum total of who I am. I am 67 and an active \textbf{ageism} disrupter. In particular, I am a 'retirement' disrupter. The expectation that retirement is a natural choice for everyone at a particular \textbf{age} reinforces a false perception that our talents and contribution are no longer valuable. Far from reality. We are valuable contributors and fair exchange for our expertise and experience is not only appropriate, but is our right. Regarding the point about using 'for my \textbf{age}', I am guilty especially in response to pressures to look younger. I often respond ' I don't want to look 10 years younger, I want to look good for my \textbf{age}'. When I deconstruct the message, I realize that it insidiously supports \textbf{ageism}. Hence, my retort is now going to be 'I want to look and feel good'. Full stop. No 'just' or 'good enough'. Simply, elegantly, and confidently 'I want to look and feel good'. So now I'm off to put in a good day's work for a client with breaks for a walk and a yoga class. All pumped up and inspired. Thank you Margaret.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Ageism & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}4/195 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.051 \\  \hline

\item The percentage of hate speech related words is 1.2309.

\item Considering that the variable \textbf{Age - General} has the most occurences in the post, we can interpret that this is the predominant hate speech.

\item Overall there were 51/108 occurences of hate speech related comments.\end{itemize}\end{document}
