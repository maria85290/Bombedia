New generations should be able to have the chance to progress human interactions or humanity. If not natives should at least see languages spoken by different tribes are being recorded and have alphabets to transcribe them.

White people who claim Native ancestry probably do so with scant evidence based on tenuous haplogroup associations. But it is revealing that she would cite love of a homeland as her reasoning. This only happens because she'd be called a \textbf{nazi} for claiming her real homeland.

I think native culture is far different from the settles culture to the point where the two people were not even thinking about routine things like living and religion in the same way. In fact, not even one bit based on texts written from the cultures shown. Christianity is not even a native European religion but borrowed. Hunting and gathering societies are also very complex and have many rules, taboos, and traditions around communication and rank to equally distributed resources among members. Western cultures is totally the opposite and there is a lot of greed and selfishness calming things as being there or feeling entitled to land and worldly things in general to the point where the tradition and religions is not even uniquely made but borrowed from another aboriginal culture from the middle east thousands of years ago during the stone \textbf{age}.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I see the New York times removed my previous comment, yet again (this is the second time)  , which comforts me in the conviction that i did the right thing by posting it. I won't post it again with all the data and links because it took me 4 hours to write and add all the links. But i will post again what summarize it . White people are responsible for the genocide of the Native people (I am Inuit) , but this is the Sionist government that is responsible for the notion of blood quantum . In other world this is HQ in Israel who makes sure that Natives are divided and that white take the blame . Same with \textbf{African} american, Sionist who own the government (make no mistake they do), are the one passing law to keep the status quo as such.  Divide to conquer while remaining hidden and putting the blame on others and turning everybody against each other, is the oldest trick in the book. But we are not all stupid and not all ignorant or oblivious of what is going and what has been going on for a very long time now. Keep on deleting my comments NYT and i'll keep on re-posting them because you deleting them is the best validation i get.I work for the UN , the biggest sionist and most atrocious org on the planet, and i hear A LOT of things in the corridors, but that's also why i live in Switzerland, one of the rare countries along  with  Iceland, China, Russia, and some countries of the Middle East to not swallow anything that is being shoved down their throat by mass culture . And of course all these countries are called dangerous . Coincidence ? Conveniently enough the US and Israel are not called dangerous places , in spite of what is going on there . Ask the Palestinians and check out the Israeli army. I am not antisemitic i have many non sionists Jewish friends who wouldn't be caught dead in Israel or the US because they have integrity and refuse to be part of the biggest threat our planet and us face today.So to my Native Nations Brothers and Sisters and to many other oppressed people out there, ... to quote Sinead ,  "Fight the real enemy" . I give you three weeks NYT for this comment to magically disappear too.

You just don't wanna be wrong 😂it appears some previously unknown group split away from northern native Americans at some point and then moved into South America around 8000 years ago, long after the initial migration.But the study also adds to a big mystery: some groups in the Amazon are somewhat more closely related to the Australasians of Australia and Papua New \textbf{Guinea} than other native Americans are. The genomes show this 'Australasian signal' is more than 10,000 years \textbf{old}. So where did it come from?archaeological excavationWorking on an ancient site in PeruMark AldenderferIf another group of people more closely related to Australasians crossed the Beringian land bridge at some point and moved down to the Amazon, why is there no trace of them in North America? And in the exceedingly unlikely event they somehow managed to cross the vast Pacific long before the Polynesians, how did they end up in the Amazon, on the other side of the Andes?'The more we look at it, the more puzzled we are,' says Moreno-Mayar.Based on shape of their skulls, it has also been claimed that many ancient humans found in the Americas cannot be the ancestors of present-day native Americans and instead belonged to a distinct group dubbed the 'Paleoamericans\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Guinea, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Nationality - Italian & \cellcolor{green!5}2/260 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.769 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The white men sailed over from another country and landed in a strange land and called it America . They stole this land from the natives and tried to get the natives to work as slaves. But because the natives knew the land too well the white decided that they will drive the natives out. And sense they couldn't force the natives to work as slaves they decided to kidnap people from Africa and ship them to America. Sense Africans didn't know the strange new land they were in they were forced to work as slaves and treated as property like animals. To them Africans and the Native were not human. At the same time they were killing \textbf{Black} men and raping \textbf{black} women they were killing and scalping the natives of this land. The civil war freed the slaves and the natives got patches of land they were not allowed to leave. Years go by and a new rising starts. This time it's the rise of the kkk they lenched the people of color used them as alligator bait. Burned crosses in neighborhoods to intimidate and terrify those who were not white.

Not all tribal people are good either,  only the ones that first seek truth and a harmony with God's (Wakan Tanka) nature.  But the white man could have existed in harmony with the Native Americans if they truly followed Christ's teachings, who I believe is the Son of God.  His sacrifice on the cross was the "Sun-Dance" for all mankind.  It was not buffalo sinews that held him, but nails.  And it was to his death.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The blood quantum in Aboriginal peoples in monitored in Canada and USA for the following reasons:  As people in this very video have stated--they are NOT Americans or Canadians and don't want to be. It's you people who want your blood quantum to be monitored. Aboriginal people don't want to be counted among us. In order to differentiate them from us, we quantify the amount of blood or ancestry is actually Aboriginal. I've seen people who were blonde haired and blue eyed and look more Caucasian than I do, but they maintain that they are a member of an Aboriginal \textbf{nation} and as such are entitled to the rights guaranteed by treaty. In Canada, that means they get free medical, free dental, free social services, and free education through university. They also get first dibs on natural resources like wild game and fish. They can veto a mining exploration claim, and they can stop production of pretty much any operation in the entire resource sector. You want to be distinct and different, this is how you want it done--by ancestry. Secondly, land claims are based on the idea that Aboriginal people were in North America first--first come, first served. Please note that this policy is not being applied in Europe with the native Europeans vs the immigrants. It's widely known and accepted that aboriginal peoples entered the Americas after the last ice \textbf{age} over the land bridge between Russia and Alaska. Aboriginal peoples don't like this because it puts them on a timeline of migration to the continent and arrival here becomes relative. Many Caucasians have lost their connection to the Earth after the Industrial Revolution. But many of us still have it. And as far as Indigenous goes, all humans are indigenous to the Earth. Aboriginal people don't have the moral high ground. If they could have done to us what we did to them, they would have. The Vikings tried to colonize Eastern Canada but the Aboriginal people kept attacking them, so they had to leave. Our people were constantly under attack for over a thousand years by Mongols from the east and Muslims from the south. In fact, the Muslims controlled the Mediterranean, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and Greece. They constantly were attacking Europe in all those places as well as what is now Romania. The words slave and Slav are related because so many Eastern Europeans (Slavs) were enslaved by Muslims the words became synonymous. Finally in the 1500s, the Europeans rose up and drove the invaders out of our lands and began a campaign of conquest  never before visited on the Earth. We'd never be victims again. The Americas were conquered as well as much of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. You want tribalism.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Sure echos what's going on in Europe now where the original people of that area are being replaced with non Europeans through migration.  If your a \textbf{racist} and uneducated in history you'll only think of the English, French and Spanish.  There there are vastly more European countries that never took part in colonization of other countries yet seem to get grouped together with the aforementioned only because of their skin colour.  All cultures in the world have experienced this at one point or the other.  Just imagine living in England when the Viking came and ravaged them for a few hundred years.  Or living in the Middle East when the Mongols came.   During the Mongolian era only those who submitted to them were spared all others were killed.  I know they committed genocide where my blood is from.

Ultimately, I like think of my self as just American because your \textbf{race} has \textbf{nothing} to do with how you live you life. The culture you were brought up in will, but not your \textbf{race}. If I was raised on a reservation and treated as a native, I would culturally be just as native Americans as the pure blood.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Let me play devils advocate for a second and this is not meant to offend... In some way, doesn't blood quantum (towards Natives) in a way,  stop \textbf{racism} over time? What I mean is people have always been so focused on \textbf{race} and rights to a particular "group" but when does it end? Shouldn't the goal of mankind be to eliminate "\textbf{race}" and live in a society where how we celebrate at home determines our heritage, but in society we are just citizens? Perhaps, the government inevitably, and maybe not intentionally, is making all, fully equal without any identity politics left to determine how we live? Social benefits for any group has caused more suffering than most forms of \textbf{racism}. Welfare and social benefits keep people oppressed. I understand that reparations for past mistakes are needed and that there are still remnants of that suffering in current generations, but our society in 2019 is so beautiful (not perfect) compared to any civilization in the past centuries. Equal opportunities are available for everyone by and large, so, by telling someone that they are Native and them living off of government assistance innately makes you feel as the "other" and is only another form of disunity from general society. Furthermore, it might even create anxiety within those "groups" because they feel perceived or real resentment from those that do not receive said benefits. I just think in a modern \textbf{age} we need to dispel with historic oppression and move forward with responsibility regarding our own lives and successes. If you do that, love and acceptance will find you. Racists are running out of places to hide nowadays and most could argue that any openly \textbf{racist} person is rejected by greater society as a whole these days. We need to teach our youth history, but not categorize them anymore. People know who the are and where they belong because of family.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small First off, I believe to put a lot of faith in those ancestry tests are \textbf{crazy}. The police can't get field drug tests accurate but science can trace your lineage accurately? Ok. And second, I think the \textbf{black} native discussion started in the Southern states and the West Coast and was adopted am taken to other parts of the country. Of you're not from the South or don't come, it probably is far-fetched to you. But if you actually come see the people, and ACTUALLY have knowledge of Africans, you will be able to see the dilemma. Furthermore, this is a thing that actually isn't denied as much as you would think in the south. It's an accepted thing by blacks, whites, and "Native Americans". The truth is still hidden and told in the South.  May never be published but they're handed down and shared within cultures. And to those asking why do blacks wanna be native Americans; we don't. We jus wanna be who we are. Americans just chose what historical documents hold relevance and which ones do not. Such as the reason a lot of blacks and native Americans have Euro in their blood is because some of our ancestors were shipped there and then bought and shipped back.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Crazy & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}2/211 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.948 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small America is the least \textbf{racist} country on planet Earth. We have not always been so, but we have learned.

If you don't want to be an American, and accept the Constitution and the culture we have built, then don't come here. That applies to everyone, except the Native Peoples who were here first. We learned a lot from them, but not enough to let them be themselves. Now we are finally learning that too. If you are of "mixed blood" - regardless of quantum - you are still Native. You have a history, a culture, an identity, a home, and no matter whether the government recognizes your claim, you can claim it nevertheless. If you learn about and cultivate your heritage, you will always have a place. It doesn't matter if you don't live on the reservation. If you know that you are of the First Peoples, then they can't take it away from you. It is who you are. Of course, the mainstream would be glad to assimilate you, but no matter the lifestyle you choose, you still have your identity.But if you are new here, get with the program!!

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small For Mexicans of the generation that fought the Mexican–American War, and generations to come, the San Patricios were heroes who came to their aid in an hour of need. For Americans of that generation, the San Patricios were considered traitors.[5] Successive Mexican presidents have praised the San Patricios; Vicente Fox Quesada stated that "The affinities between Ireland and Mexico go back to the first years of our \textbf{nation}, when our country fought to preserve its national sovereignty ... Then, a brave group of Irish soldiers ... in a heroic gesture, decided to fight against the foreign ground invasion",[6] and Mexican president Ernesto Zedillo stated "Members of the St. Patrick's Battalion were executed for following their consciences. They were martyred for adhering to the highest ideals ... we honor their memory. In the name of the people of Mexico, I salute today the people of Ireland and express my eternal gratitude".[7]The great majority of these men were recent immigrants who had arrived at northeastern U.S. ports, part of the Irish diaspora then escaping the Great Irish Famine and extremely poor economic conditions in Ireland, part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland at the time. The U.S. Army often recruited Irishmen and other immigrants into military service shortly or sometimes immediately after arrival in America in coffin ships, with promises of salaries and land after the war.Numerous theories have been proposed as to their motives for desertion, including cultural alienation,[8][9] mistreatment of \textbf{immigrant} soldiers by nativist soldiers and \textbf{senior} officers,[10][9] brutal military discipline and dislike of service in the U.S. military,[9] being forced to attend Protestant church services and being unable to practice their Catholic religion freely[11] as well as religious ideological convictions,[9] the incentive of higher wages and land grants starting at 320 acres (1.3 km2) offered by Mexico,[12][9] and viewing the U.S. invasion of Mexico as unjust.[11][13]It is believed primary motivations were shared religion with the Mexicans and sympathy for the Mexican cause based on similarities between the situations in Mexico and Ireland. This hypothesis is based on evidence of the number of Irish Catholics in the battalion, the letters of John Riley, and the field entries of \textbf{senior} officers.[14][15] Another hypothesis is that the members of the Saint Patrick's Battalion had been unhappy with their treatment in the U.S. Army; this was the conviction of George Ballentine, an Englishman who served in the American army. Ballentine stated that while "there was a portion of truth" in the view—commonly assigned by officers—that the deserters joined the Mexican army due to their Catholicism, "I have good reason to believe, in fact in some cases I know, that harsh and unjust treatment by their officers operated far more strongly than any other consideration to produce the deplorable result [desertion]," describing how he found the punishments used for "trivial offensives" to be "revolting and disgusting".[16] Another theory some historians hold is that the soldiers were attracted by the incentives offered by the Mexican government: safe passage throughout Mexico for deserters, generous land grants, and the offer of potential military commissions.[17] For poor people coming from famine conditions, economics was often an important incentive.[18]Mexican author José Raúl Conseco noted that many Irish lived in northern Texas, and were forced to move south due to regional insecurity. Mainly Irish settlers from San Patricio, Texas, had previously sided with Mexican forces against Texan rebels at the Battle of Lipantitlán in the Texan Revolution.[19]Irish expatriates had a long tradition of serving in military forces of Catholic countries, for instance, serving with Spain and later France in groups of young men who had left Ireland during what would become known as the Flight of the Wild Geese in the 17th century. In addition, many Irish fought as soldiers in South American wars of independence.[c]\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Immigrant, Nation, Senior & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}4/634 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.631 \\  \hline

In America starting with the \textbf{Indian} who settled here  from Asia, followed by the European. Historical events make us what we are today, like it or not. I'm part \textbf{Indian} like many Americans whose European ancestors came to the New World early on, Spanish French, English, Dutch.  My culture is not \textbf{Indian}-linguistically, religiously, or do I live on federal lands or claim anything \textbf{Indian} except for blood like many Europeans here since the  1600's.  Indians regardless of blood percentage are more European in culture than their nativeness.  On this video. they are speaking a European language and wearing European clothing, taking advantage of todays technology and education,  for beginners followed by a whole slew of Europeans practices more part of their daily life than  their \textbf{Indian} roots. We are all united  in the U.S. together regardless of the wrongs of the past, \textbf{Indian} or European. We do not have the mentality of the sixteenth century, thank God, we have grown up to develop human rights in an imperfect world.  Our ancestors were violent we would not want to go there.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Juan Garcia   Mexico's borders/were defined by modern history. Just like all countries in the Americas. When the Spanish conquered Tenochititlan, and renamed it Mexico City, there was no Mexico to speak of, the Spanish named the new found  territories New Spain. Part of New Spain was renamed the Republic of Mexico approx 1824.  In other words when Cortez arrived in what the Spanish named Vera Cruz, 1520, they did not recognize it as Mexico and neither did the Indians. Things developed over 300 years in what today we know as Mexico, as any historian knows. Even New Mexico got it's name in 1560,  over 250 years before Mexico got it's name. New Mexico named for "new"  treasures the Spanish hoped to discover as with the Mexica  Aztez gold  in Mexico City, thus  " new" Mexico---later to discover there was  no gold, only Indians living in dust; New Mexico errorously named causing assumptions and confusion in history.  The Spanish considered the Aztecs rich, but found only Indians living in poverty in New Mexico.  Look in any  pre 1821 map of Spanish America which is inclusive of the southwest, California, Texas, Louisiana, Georgia, Florida, Carolinas, Pacific Coast to Canada. Europeans; Spanish, English and French,  studied the territories,  the indigenous natives, tributaries, latitudes, mountains, rivers,  etc. Collectively they knew more about what is today the U.S. then the \textbf{Indian} and documented their findings.   The Spanish had conquered the Zacatecas  Indians and opened  the way north from Compostela, Coronados journey all the way to Kansas appox 1550. With better technology such as the gun; and the with the horse the Spanish was able to accomplish travel in inhospitable lands, untame, waterless/dehydration  and uninhabitable cactus and throne filled environments,  impassable moutain ranges.  And it was the Spanish who conquered wild, warring  Indians, known to other Indians further south as strange lands of the dogs towards the north with  fierce Yaki  warriors. In other words the Aztec and other Indians in those territories had no need for lands or Indians to the north or were they anywhere n close proximity.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Mike Barooshian Native Americans are far from the only conquered people's in the world. Science has PROVEN that ALL life started in Africa. Our ancient ancestors ALL migrated from the same place. Native Americans and East Asians share some of the same genes. Because they were once one people who migrated. The greatest, most ruthless and vicious  conqueror was from China. China had empires of conquered people. Long before the Romans or the English set forth to conquer the world. And all races have held slaves. Middle eaternerner had more \textbf{African} slaves than America. South America had far more slaves than the US did. And we had white slaves for 100 years before they brought the first \textbf{African} slave. Middle Easterners preferred white slaves and stole them off the coast of the UK countries. And they held slaves in the Middle East for and 20 years after slavery ended in the US. So many things that Americans don't think about. Or maybe just don't know. It's not like America invented all the bad things that has happened in the past. Americans are just the only country where people are obsessed with it. And no matter how obsessed they are, they are \textbf{blind} to the fact that it's happening again. A past unknown will repeat itself. Instead of worrying about the past, 100s of years ago, worry about the future. I'm not saying to forget or not to care. By all means, never forget.

And I am white and not proud of being white. In this life I saw what white people did to natives and I see what they do today to all other people. . I am ashamed and I cry for all. In my own behavior I try to be an example how people should interact and respect mother Earth and each other. With that I get help of my present wife, a Chinese and in her former life my wife as well. What kind of mix in \textbf{Race} (ugly word) or how pure one's blood is is not a measurement of "status".

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small ​\@See You Tonight We have no \textbf{common} racial lineage with any asian. Ongoing scientific research and government studies (by our governments) always find us as uniquely Americans only. No mutation or some kind of magical hybrid. See, what you don't see, is that it's always a species that evolves, not a \textbf{race}.There's never been scientific evidence of a mutated \textbf{race}. After the big evolution or birthing (we came out of another great \textbf{ape} says decades of expert research), we basically just cared about our health and exercised or ate healthily and our bodies changed because of this, so we could get around and move in a timely manner.You'd know so much better if you were an Americans. Our Americans parents remembered our family history. Many of them are heavily qualified scientists and knew much at the time. That's our government statistics and our friend's family lives to us. Also, not unqiuely at all, my other parent (who was \textbf{black}) knew my father's family history because of being a friend of his family and knowing each other since they were one years \textbf{old}. So I had two parents talk about this. People give the impression that we knew we evolved in Africa and that's all we knew. But the real answer is that people were kind of not smart and the world was between a lot of studies and so it tells them something to fit their ongoing interest in science.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small CocaineDragon I didn't even have to read your whole comment to know you're completely wrong. Native Americans came from Asians thousands of years by a land bridge. So yes, Natives and Asian are genetically similar. A \textbf{race} of humans don't just pop up on a continent where no other humans have never been before, they had to come to from somewhere. Also, a whole species don't evolve at the same time. Example: dogs come from a wolf like species and slowly became dogs. Those dogs also evolved into different breeds of dogs to survive in whatever environment  they're in. How do you think we have so many races, we aren't all different species that are genetically similar. Actually scientific studies show that the races of humans are the same species but slightly evolved for their certain environment.

Hardly any Native Americans are full blooded anymore. Hardly anyone of any \textbf{race} is full blooded anymore (unless they are first or second generation American).

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The painful truth: It was the destiny for the Native American to be removed of their theoretical  "ownership" of this land. Why? Because all the various "tribes" were simply too busy fighting each other to defend themselves and make this land prosperous. They paid the ultimate price of tribal warfare, Africa starves, Natives lost their land, such is the cost of pride, a core focus of tribalism.  Had the "white man" not come to this land of abundant resources, a multitude of Asian countries or Russia would have. Natives would never have advanced to defend themselves on the land of great resources because of tribalism.Luckily, it was the "white guy" affording you the opportunity to speak out in the first place. If China came first, there would be no Native Americas left and you'd be oppressed to silence.  You can't propel a country forward by being stuck in the past, this statement is evident on virtually all reservations you drive through. A people given so much opportunity without having to work for it, yet squander it for a past that for none of us exist today. So why do people feel the whole idea of reservations should disappear? Simple really, they are \textbf{nothing} more than a wasteland of rotting trailers, a place where despite all the given opportunities accomplishes \textbf{nothing}, and is a tax burden for a past that is not part of our future for all of us as a whole. Stop being "proud" and start accomplishing something for the world. It's not the people I don't like, it's the situation. I am being asked to pay for something that I was neither part of nor could have influenced. My hours are an investment that work in one direction. When tax dollars are squandered, that is the same as taking hours, days and year from my life. I still have to work for those earnings, that is the situation I deal with now in this present day. As for \textbf{African} Americans, they were sold to Americans from \textbf{black} \textbf{African} generals, they were slaves in Africa too. Luckily their ancestors got a ticket to the free land for a price, as did mine and many others. The price was always some form of suffering. Now you all live here and can speak freely about what you don't like. If China took over, you could be put to death for that. If it were not for the "white guy" Native Americans really only had about 50 years left before being wiped out entirely. Did you know a huge number of light and dark \textbf{colored} people occupied this land before the Native American. There is a history of that most avoid because it's a dark truth. They've been digging up the mass graves in the midwest of bodies that existed long before any of the wars we read about in our regular history books or in native carvings. The Native Americans we know are only a small remnant of was here before them. There is one existing record and everyone has access to it. So no, Native Americans are not indigenous either, just a remnant that proliferated after another culture before them.So no, I would not ask to be even 1/256th native, I am a future minded person. I believe in the people of this land functioning as a whole. I know that if we keep squeezing ourselves to smaller and smaller tribes, internal warfare is inevitable and all you fight for now is rendered moot for this land will yet again be lost for the third time. Tribal warfare only leads to death and suffering, make no mistake, the history of all the world will confirm that is true. Prove me wrong in actions, not in words. You replaying to me does not cause more patents to show up in the patent office, it does not perpetuate freedom or utilize the best education for the lowest cost. One has no voice unless they have action. Accomplishment has the greatest positive impact. Walk through a reservation and show me what I am looking at? Show me the accomplishment, aside from casinos waiting for non-natives to come and gamble. I don't get the whole \textbf{race} thing, we all lost greatly to be here, no one is special in this.

Look at any Mexican today they look little to \textbf{nothing} like the Native Americans you seen before they were "colonized by white people". They were literally orientals with dark skin. Almost all of Mexicans today look Middle Eastern. There was a Mexican educator who tested his genealogy and found he was Jewish. He did this for some 60 other people and found they were all Jewish even though they claimed "pure" Native American heritage. So yes, if Mexico was "conquered by the evil whites" as our "History texts" so claim wouldn't all Mexicans today be blonde haired with blue eyes like the Norwegians are?

And let's not forget the fact that \textbf{African} Americans were more accepted, recognized and welcomed into thousands of tribes and were allowed to live with and marry within these tribes ... but if you hear their offsprings speak proudly of their lineage today... it is often laughed at, mocked and/or watered down to the basic term 'black'. My people, the Caribs, were brown skin people. Many indigenous Americans were described as brown/bronzed skin. And many of the lighter skin natives are the result of (like many \textbf{African}/Caribbean Americans) colonization. Being Native American is much more than your color.

Those people didn't look at Asian they had dark skin many Asians have pale skin, the natives and the pictures eyes were small Beady and closer to the nose.  Current natives, the people today look like a blend.  I think many will be surprised to find they are NOT 100 BUT AS we natives know we trace/chart our lineage.  That is how we know for a fact we are related further we have rules ya know to keep it all pure as we can for our land sake.  Otherwise we'd have none left by now.

So, I guess that means they had no \textbf{ethnic} identities before the 1800's because they had no "true" (read western) way to prove their identities.The reality is, most east coast Native American "tribes" (actually \textbf{ethnic} groups) used matrilineal descent (meaning there were no such things as "half-breeds" since you either have a native mother or you don't...OR they had cultural ways of deciding membership in their people). Matrilineal descent is of course partly genetic, but it means there is no such things as being "half" or "quarter" this and that, nor does such descent always agree with how a person looks. Matrilineal descent can be tested with DNA (mitochondrial), but it falls short if sometimes an individual was adopted into another line or other unfortunate things happened to the tribe. There were many many many cases of individuals with a native mother who identified 100 with her "tribe" but had a French father.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Are you talking about the Natives and how they hate white people?(Just wanted to make sure I understood your comment before I start typing) Many, including myself, Natives don't actually hate white people. There are a lot of them, and we have to deal with them everyday haha. So it would be exhausting to resent them all the time XD. On a serious note, Natives are kinda cruel with our humor. So we do tend to tease white people, but we even do that with ourselves and other races! You will find other races doing the same thing actually. But most people don't do that because that doesn't make you look good. It's not all about hate. I like a lot of white people. My family tolerates them lol. Just kidding! But I honestly don't like the white guilt thing. It's not your fault, and pretty soon who ever's fault it was will be dead because they're all pretty \textbf{old} by now.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Tribes and regions definitely differ, so maybe that's why you haven't seen it, but it's a serious issue. In my area, the reservations have little or no drinking water, electricity is patchy, and the majority of the population deals with some form of \textbf{mental} illness and addiction. It doesn't matter what \textbf{race} it is, if people grow up in those conditions, they tend to carry around a lot of that kind of thinking. You come across it a lot in cardboard cities and shanty towns in the third world. It is very taxing.  You can see the strain. It affects every aspect of their lives. It's voiced constantly, and people act out on it on a regular basis, in a manner very similar to what you'd hear about in the fifties and sixties in the south. But there's a level of justification behind it. You'll hear that it's OK because of genocide or the trail of tears. They go over timelines, saying that we did this and that, and they do teach their children to hate. It's well known. We can't even go on the reservations here without getting stopped by police or chased off. They include it in their belief systems as well. One tribe regularly reenacts massacres they faced at the hands of whites in their rituals by dressing up like white people, just like we used to do with blacks when we painted our faces dark in the early 20th century. They teach that western science is wrong, that there's a conspiracy against them. I mean, honestly, it's bad. There are studies as well. You can actually look over sociological surveys about native american views on \textbf{racism},. They regularly poll as of the most \textbf{racist} demographics in the world. It's not just here, either. You can actually go through the different regions of the world and hear indigenous people in asia, australia, africa, the pacific, and south america voicing similar concerns. In australia, in patricular, you'll  find a lot of this because of how the aboriginals are treated,. In canada, the natives are treated like trash, and they say the exact same stuff you hear in the US. I can't imagine for one second that you haven't seen this firsthand. But I've also been up to the reservations in oregon and washington, and they were very different from what I've seen.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Mental, Race, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}4/394 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.015 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small There is a lot that you are feeling and I'm happy you shared it with me. I honestly had no idea about most of this stuff. It's sad because our culture is dying and if we can share it, then maybe we can preserve it. I know about the living conditions on the reservation but I only visit for family from time to time. I never knew about the social conditions. Could you please tell me what tribes you're referring to when talking about the reenactment thing and a link for the polls. I am genuinely curious and would find it ridiculous if some tribes are doing this. I hope not. I'm from Lac Courte Oreilles which is in Wisconsin, and we would never do something like that. We welcome white people and all people to come and visit us to learn more. My views are probably different because I was raised in a big city. I come from a place that has all races, and my family is mixed from \textbf{black} to white to Mexican. I have no tolerance for \textbf{racism} and I wish that many Natives along with other races can accept all people. Yes, you can still be \textbf{racist} to whites(just for those who happen to see this lol). We live such short lives and it's a waste to be hung up on the past. It's important to recognize it, and use it as a lesson to heal from. I know my people are still suffering from this and really need help because so many of them are lost. Right now we should be working towards a better society and that won't work if all we do is hate each other. We really should be helping each other. I'm happy that you are trying to learn about Native culture honestly. Which tribe are you near/familiar with? This is all so interesting. I'm a curious and open-minded person and I'm still learning more about the world. Sorry if my comment is all over the place as well haha.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I can't find the poll. It's something I've seen a couple of times. My friend attended the reenactment. I live near the Yaqui, Apache and Tohono O'odham reservations, among others. I think she said Yaqui. I've been to their sweats, and their shamans sometimes give people peyote and perform cleansings. They do things that you see modern pagans doing, like creating sacred space, raising energy, using sweet grass to spread positive energy or  blessing, and they seem to have spirits that they call to from the four directions--north, south, east, west etc. Your tribe instantly came to mind, or at least I think it was yours, because of a movie I like, Smoke Signals. I learned a lot about all of this working at a facility for youth who have \textbf{mental} health and drug abuse issues. They flood the system and make up a good portion of the patients in facilities like that in my area. I've seen birth defects, side effects of toxicity--probably pollution, illegal dumping idk. The qualities are definitely third world in a lot of places, and it's sad. I feel like the people are wallowing, so they're stagnating. They're not moving forward. I highly agree with you on everything you said about \textbf{racism}. That's exactly how I see it. I also agree that they shouldn't be hiding their traditions. I've been telling people for years that if they would just share them they wouldn't die. Tribes address this in different ways, but I've heard the consensus is that they'd rather let their traditions die. It's not so bad, because it's documented, especially the bigger tribes, but the belief systems branch off. Shamans name successors,. They'll have no sons or they'll decide for some reason that they can't name anyone, and their wisdom is lost.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Mental, Racism & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}2/298 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.671 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Yeah, that's a really sad way to put it. But it's pretty much true. Only so many youth can speak the language, but they end up mostly becoming gangbangers and drug addicts where I'm from. Many of them do have \textbf{mental} illnesses as well. It's a sad reality and my neighborhood has been getting really bad recently. There's a heroin epidemic against the Natives in my city and the homeless population had suddenly increased. There is a tent city blocks away from where I live. That's the first time I've seen it get so bad and you're right. My people are stagnant. Many of them hold negative feelings towards the world and have lost their way. If only they could carry on our traditions and heal themselves. Our elders are dying everyday and soon there won't be anything left. If only... That's why there are still some Natives who are trying to fight back against the negativity. Even though we're poor, we are still doing our best to make a difference. At least for the next generation. I'm only 18, but I'm trying to do my best in my community by also doing some youth work. We try to hold language classes at the community center or teach children how to bead etc... Even ceremonies and whatnot. That's also very interesting how you talk about how similar our traditions are with the Pagan ceremonies. I actually really like learning about Paganism and all that and it feels nice to know that we share similar traditions with another group of people. :) This whole thing is bittersweet.

I also don't like the term " Indians or American Indians", Native people are not Indians,  to me that is more of a slur than anything else.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I prefer the version where we accept all the mixtures that have resulted from history, because history cannot now be changed, at it was a time of considerable ignorance and confusion. but within these mixtures, everyone can have some concept of their history, and "lands". Not so possessive to a 100 and so not so much as to tell others to "get out", that's too strong, that's xenophobic. But simply to value it. What history there is, what is known, for however many 1000s years. This is true for europeans and indians in india too of course. Or at least, it probably should be. There's a lot of meanings wrapped up, even in the languages we talk, they refer to it, they contain the history of the places too. It's all subtly written into the communications, the humour, well everything reallly, and severing those links with some ideology, just seems like a route to nihilism to me. A world of \textbf{nothing} but material things. No place in time. No past, means, no future ; no appreciation of ancestors, means, no one will remember you in the future either. So yeah . Land matters. But everyone is entitled to a feeling in relation to that idea. Not just native americans. It also cannot be purely "we were here first", because so many tribes moved about so much every which way through the 1000s years of the past. So must accept the modern mix like it is. I found some of this video is exaggerating things too. the "blood quantum" it is for special BENEFITS not restrictions. Which were supposed to allow Native Americans to enact different land laws. Many native tribes, i just read, actually use these blood quanta to decide who is in their tribes. And they remove people if they do not have enough. She makes it sound as if it's something nasty the government is doing. The tribes themselves make up the rules these days, and even made the memberships stricter.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Varoon You know what's really hilarious? Over 800,000 Jews left Europe during the so-called "Holocaust" to Mexico. Look at any Mexican today they look little to \textbf{nothing} like the Native Americans you seen before they were "colonized by white people". They were literally orientals with dark skin. Almost all of Mexicans today look Middle Eastern. There was a Mexican educator who tested his genealogy and found he was Jewish. He did this for some 60 other people and found they were all Jewish even though they claimed "pure" Native American heritage.

I will save you time. \textbf{Zero}. Before this time the conquered people were either all slaughtered who didn't flee out of the reach of the invaders or were forced to become in every way to be like the conquerors or some were not slaughtered and were slaves that served and usually until death. Any children were also slaves, etc. There was not "native peoples" when Europeans came. There were over 500 different and distinct native peoples/tribes. All with different cultures and languages. Some were warrior types that slaughtered other tribes like the Apache and some of those enslaved the conquered tribes. Some were more sedentary and stayed in an certain area and some were more nomadic. To believe the brainwashing we get in schools that they were just minding their business and in harmony and peace is to be an ignorant fool who knows \textbf{nothing} about humans and our shared history. What killed most of the Natives ? Diseases they had no immunities to. Did the Europeans infect them on purpose ?

But, that is an odd circumstance of how the U.S. evolved. There are people in tribes who barely appear to be native at all, yet consider themselves so because that was the culture they grew up in (and, being a part of a tribe, they would have to have, at least, some by now), and there are people whose families had never been associated with a tribe who look almost full-blooded who are scared that claiming to be \textbf{indian} is, somehow, wrong for them to do and consider themselves white, even while being aware of and or proud of that heritage.

For example, among biracial adults who are white and American \textbf{Indian}, only 22 say they have a lot in \textbf{common} with American Indians; 61 say they have a lot in \textbf{common} with whites. And only 19 say they have had a lot of contact with their relatives who are American \textbf{Indian}."Racemixing is slowly erasing them, considering how low the native american population is in the US and considering that many US "native americans" are less than 50 native american genetically. If all native americans mixed, all native american cultures would be assimilated by the much more dominant western culture present in the Americas today (not to mention that their unique physical appearance would be lost forever too). There's a reason why most of their languages are dying today, also, did you know that native american DNA could literally disappear forever after generations of \textbf{race} mixing? [LINK] "According to 23andMe, Native American DNA has been known to "wash out" in a few short  generations (about 5), especially if none of your other progenitors introduced it along the way. Wash-outs usually occur during Random Genetic Recombination, when DNA gets randomly remixed as it passes from parent to child --- some of it (\textbf{ethnic} components/DNA sequences from our direct fore-parents) eventually gets lost over time."Apparently the US government still wants native americans to be assimilated and eventually erased by racemixing, it was used as a method of genocide before:"It seems to me one of the ways of getting rid of the \textbf{Indian} question is just this of intermarriage, and the gradual fading out of the \textbf{Indian} blood; the whole quality and character of the aborigine disappears, they lose all of the traditions of the \textbf{race}; there is no longer any occasion to maintain the tribal relations, and there is then every reason why they shall go and take their place as white people do everywhere" - Anthony Higgins\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African, Black, Common, Ethnic, Indian, Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Ethnicity - Native-American, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}14/438 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.196 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Well it seems that the US government is still to this day actively committing a "silent" genocide against native americans, allow me to explain, and this will be a long comment:Native americans are the most marginalized \textbf{race} in the US, they're the poorest, they have the highest chance of being unjustly killed by the police, they suffer a suicide and alcoholism epidemic, reservations generally don't have even the most basic needs covered like water or electricity and the list goes on. Yet, how many times do you hear about these problems in the media? The fact that they're not the utmost priority in the US is completely beyond me, and I can only assume that this is deliberately done, they're purposefully ignored by the government.The whole reservation system is designed so that native americans leave their reservations and marry outside their \textbf{race} in order to ascend in the social ladder, diluting their bloodlines and thus making true native americans disappear over time, people need to realize that this is forced assimilation and this method of genocide has been done before in history as a deliberate attempt to wipe out groups of people, as is the case of the "stolen generations" with the Australian aborigenes. This is one of the few videos interviewing supposed "native americans" and what do we get? A demonization of the blood quantum system, the whole video is designed so as to give the average viewer the impression that this is how all native americans think, we didn't get a diversity of opinions on the subject, nope, just a uniform, generally negative opinion about blood quantum despite the fact that this system keeps people that don't have even one native american ancestor from enrolling in a tribe and getting benefits that should be destined to real native americans.

Native americans have also suffered numerous massacres and sterilizations in Latin America just in the 80s and 90s, yet this is rarely heard in mainstream media. Again, all we get is an emotionally manipulative video with a bunch of people that don't even look like they're half native american (that just by their appearance they will have a MUCH different life experience) claiming that blood quantum is somehow \textbf{racist} and giving the indirect message that full blooded native americans are \textbf{racist} for wanting to keep existing, not a single mention of the actual much more serious problems native americans face. The people behind this video don't actually care about them, they're just using their label to push an agenda.If the US government (and all the governments from all the countries from this continent) really cared about native americans, they would give them true independence, but obviously no government would willingly give up land of their country just to create a new one for such a powerless and irrelevant minority like native americans...\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/228 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.877 \\  \hline

Look at any Mexican today they look little to \textbf{nothing} like the Native Americans you seen before they were "colonized by white people". They were literally orientals with dark skin. Almost all of Mexicans today look Middle Eastern. There was a Mexican educator who tested his genealogy and found he was Jewish. He did this for some 60 other people and found they were all Jewish even though they claimed "pure" Native American heritage. So yes, if Mexico was "conquered by the evil whites" as our "History texts" so claim wouldn't all Mexicans today be blonde haired with blue eyes like the Norwegians are?

My grandparents for years told me and my siblings we had cherokee on one side and creek on the other. They believed it deeply so we believed it. My sister became very interested in genealogy and started charting back family and couldn't find any members linked to natives, we did have one member who was a question mark we didn't know anything about her other then family members memories, she was a mystery to them she spoke very little and with broken english. she looked native so they assumed she was or were told by other family members she was.  My sister decided to take a DNA test to know for sure. Absolutely no native blood what so ever, mostly Irish, English, Germanic, and a touch of Norwegian.

It would be easier and kinder for all to agree on willfully segregating society or send everyone including white races back to our original place of origin. We all just return to where God intended for us to evolve unhindered in the first place. As a Caucasian I can honestly say I do not hate any of the brown races of the world. But when I see them holding back and endangering white culture and Euro societies , it both saddens and angers me terribly. This is what feeds the hate in hateful people. I refuse to hate. I simply love and want to protect my own endangered cultures. We all do better and prosper among our own. Show me how diversity is our strength? Its a  brainwashing slogan. \textbf{Nothing} more.  If you wish to help another \textbf{race} get ahead, by all means go ahead. I am talking to \textbf{lunatic} far leftist white liberals. But dont try to drag the rest of your Western society into your disillusion conceived unnatural  ideologies  of multiculturalism and diversity. Go help them on your dime in their own countries.  Diversity is proven time and again to be a failed social experiment. Face it already and lets return to nature based laws of \textbf{common} sense. Some different cultures, races, and religions do manage to coincide harmoniously together such as Indonesian, Europeans, Chinese, and Japanese. But others clash violently like opposing magnets, Why fight it? Yah want real peace between the cultures for all time? Return to natures original plan of segregation. Multiculturalism kills cultures.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Nani Sunami, I hope to be that Native American \textbf{woman} president some day. Majored in Political Science to hold office, and was the founder of the Tea Party, headed up the TN Libertarian Party for over 22 yrs, still work in politics. I run End Times Prophecy News Update, Carrie Geren Scoggins webcast. Please go to my pg and find my playlist of videos, my most recent, "Abortion Is Not A Choice Issue, As It Is Not A Victimless Crime, Carrie Geren Scoggins," and "There Is NO Freedom From Religion, Carrie Geren Scoggins," are 2 good videos representing my work.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    In the state of Tennessee, with those of us that are Cherokee, such as myself, we are registered on a registry, which began dating back to the Trail of Tears, and from that point, the family genealogy was kept up with by the state. I assume this is what the speaker means by the state knowing our "quantum," though those terms are not used in Tennessee.  My family's history is on the data base, and the state has records of my whole genealogy. I believe that this was done with \textbf{racist} motives back when the record keeping began, as those that were Native Americans were not only brought in through the back door in Tennessee, but they were either forced to leave, or had to prove that they were \textbf{disabled} and could not go on the infamous Trail Of Tears. Why so many registered Native Americans did not go to Oklahoma, was that the civil war was on during the taking of the lands, and if the children were off fighting the war, the \textbf{elderly} family members were allowed to stay on their land. Later came the land grab via marriage laws, where if a \textbf{woman} was a Native American, the state would give a white man 500 acres of Native American, Cherokee lands, to any man that would marry the \textbf{woman}.  The state began breeding us out, and using our own land in payment to any white man that would take a Native American bride, in order to carry out this movement.  This ended in Cleveland, TN area, the Aimohee District of the original Cherokee \textbf{Nation}, left with many mixed families, and almost no family in the area without being partially Cherokee.  My own family is on the Lee Registry, and our family has been kept on logs and files since the civil war era, which today is still done under the guise of getting state money, land in a 'rez,' or reservation, and other benefits that were the 'trade,' for our lands.  These are not "entitlements," as the state took land in trade for this, so note that this is not welfare. I always feel the need to point this out, as Native Americans are now hated due to getting state funds, though this was the trade off from the state, initiated by the US government, and not by the Native Americans.  I personally have had people accuse me of getting my college tuition paid for due to being Cherokee, as recently as last week, and I find this as a typical insult degrading my own triumph of hard work putting my own self through college.  I was the brunt of hearing insults about Cherokee's now having casinos on their land, this came from my now x in-laws, and many others. There are many insults hurled at Native Americans, and the media never tackles these racial issues, because as the young boy in this video stated, people feel as though all the Native Americans are now dead.  In the end, I \textbf{colored} my hair back dark, because I realized that I did not represent my own heritage, my own family, and that I was conforming to what I felt that I needed to do to be in the media.  I heard a \textbf{woman} say " I changed my mind on getting a nose job, because I realized that I had my dad's nose, and changing was losing my own family history."  I took this to heart, as being Cherokee, I have the large nose, and my hair was always the darkest \textbf{black}, and to change this, is separating myself from my family line, from my heritage, and from who we are.  When given a choice now, I too would refuse the nose jobs, or changing my hair color to make me appear more white, to 'fit in.'  During my junior high years my mother did bleach my hair, and stated clearly that it was so that I would look more white, and it was in hopes of stopping the racial attacks at school from those believing that I was Hispanic.  One can hide their \textbf{race}, they can "tone it down," but as an adult, I have decided that I am not going around disguised as a white person. I have had a greater insult in my now loss of a love, David Wilcock, when he left me for a white \textbf{woman} claiming to be a Shaman, when in reality, I am the real blood line Shaman.  That is when I said that I never wanted to lighten my hair to look white-r, to conform, again, no matter the cost. When society pushes a white Shaman, because we the Native Americans are not considered 'good enough,' to represent our own religion, it's time to cut them off, and kick them out of our lives.  The radio stations allow white people to claim our religion, take our leadership positions, but they can never take our pride.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I find this topic very interesting, the concept of what it means to be indigenous, the social implications and how that changes within the Americas. The USA has a very particular way of dealing with \textbf{race} (one drop rule, the legality of interracial marriages etc.) and consequently the social and legal norms for deciding who is considered to be a part of the indigenous group. I read about people that have been caught lying about their native heritage, "Five Civilized Tribes" etc. In Latin America interracial mixing was encouraged (for better or worse) and so you have a situation e.g. in Brazil where even the white population generally speaking have native ancestry and the mestizo population have a high degree of visible native ancestry. Coupled with the fact that there are still native populations in the Amazon that haven't even had any contact with the "modern world" , the social and legal norms are totally different when it comes to who is considered indigenous. For instance the concept of white-passing indigenous is totally foreign, it just isn't a cultural and legal matter that was ever relevant in the Brazilian context. The take on who is indigenous are just miles apart even though the populations were both heavily affected by colonization. However I do not place any judgement on who is what, I simply find the history behind it and the different expressions of "nativeness" in the Americas to be fascinating.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/240 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.417 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small During my travels throughout the U.S., I sometime encountered people that would lay claim to being "Native American", and without knowing more about them, one has to assume they probably do have some indigenous DNA in their biological makeup. I never questioned their statement; still, part of me always thinks they are only saying this because in their heart of hearts, they know they are the descendants of foreign-born immigrants. With that said, here is how you know if you are Native American. Each time you fill out a census form, college admission application, or a job application, if you identify yourself as such in the demographic discovery portion of the application, and you are honest, then you are probably a native. If you identify as white, well then, there you are. fastede III52, I don't think anyone here is purposefully trying to be insensitive toward you, and no one is questioning whether you have a Native American grandparent. Nevertheless, as long as we are talking about being insensitive. We just watched a video wherein a young \textbf{woman} is exclaiming aloud how her peoples BLOOD is being quantified. I wonder if people watching this video truly understand this. We have to wrap our heads around the significance of what is being explained here. First \textbf{nation} peoples are being checked for their genetic markers in order to weed out anyone that can be identified as not possessing sufficient ancestral DNA. WHY?! This is also explained in the video, and it is done so that once there are no more Native Americans left, the treaty with their people becomes void, and the land can be claimed. We watched as a young \textbf{woman}, with tears in her eyes, explained why her grandfather feels he has to hide away, not in shame, but so that his children, and his children's children, will not lose their tribal rights. So when Joao Santos or anyone else points out that MAYBE. You should not call yourself this, before you take it personal, maybe first stop a moment. Just stop a moment, to ask yourself, am I being quantified genetically in any way, in an attempt to marginalize my person or my immediate relatives and deprive me of my rights or my ancestral heritage? Ask yourself these questions, and if the answer is no, and you have otherwise lived unfettered in these United States of America, then go your way in peace friend. You are a U.S. citizen and no one is blaming you for the atrocities committed against these peoples; but please be sensitive to their plight.

Virginia was still a segregated state at the time. Anyway, my cousin and I were out walking on a trail along a creek in the woods when we came across his neighbor who was our \textbf{age}. His neighbor had a homemade tomahawk his dad had made him. My cousin told his neighbor I was part \textbf{Indian}. His neighbor asked me if that was true. I said "yes".

I pulled pack and the blade of his tomahawk cut my cheek. We fought and I won. I took the tomahawk away from him and threw it as far as I could into the creek.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small There is an interesting phenomena amongst a lot of Americans of European descent claiming to have indigenous ancestry.  It's actually fairly \textbf{common}.  I've oft wondered where this comes from.  Was an ancestor a \textbf{black} \textbf{African}, and the family tried to hide it? Did the tent revivals of the past lay the seed of some sort of native ancestry so white European Americans could rationalize their presence on this continent?  Seriously, I really do wonder.  Since I was born, I've been told we have some Cherokee ancestry.  One of my mum's cousins says Cherokee \& Choctaw.  That cousin also shared a photo with me and my mum, stating the women in the photo were our native ancestors! Granted, my \textbf{immigrant} ancestors \& their descendants moved into the areas these indigenous people inhabited, as well as live along the Trail of Tears, but \textbf{nothing} in my genealogical history has yielded a damned thing except a story someone composed that they heard from their grandmother.  No one was raised native, that's for sure, so if they were indigenous, they left the blanket long ago.  My mum recently had her \textbf{ethnic} DNA done, and even though this offered only a keyhole into our ancestry, it shows she is completely European.  None of her cousins have shown any indigenous dna either.  This year, that myth dies in my family, and to be honest I'm relieved, because it felt wrong to claim any native \textbf{nation}, because we have none of those traditions or connections.  I think as more and more European Americans have \textbf{ethnic} dna performed, the majority will discover it's a myth for them as well.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}African, Black, Common, Ethnic, Immigrant, Nation, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Nationality - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}8/271 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.952 \\  \hline

We owe it to the tribes to get them to a low cost of living for power. This would allow them to invest more in their culture, and grow with the times as we get to.*Declare a certain amount of capital for house building \& roads . The housing situation needs to be totally brand new! This administration is a construction king! There is no better time than now to have floor plans created for homes that can stand the test of time for generations to come for these families. These people need to be proud of our \textbf{nation}, and a home is just should help with that!*Address the water issues! Many areas have no running water. Federal government passes the \textbf{buck} down to state and local government on this critical issue. This is absolutely UNACCEPTABLE!*Have a one time grant for the large discounted price of two vehicles per family household. I mean literally having a discussion with auto companies and getting the lowest price ever for these tribes. The ultimate goal is to prove that we are not trying to bury them in debt, but to give them the start of a new legacy as a people. It's time to bless them. As we are expecting a wall to built between Mexico, we should also make efforts for walls to be torn down with respect to the lack of aid/communication to Native Tribes.*It's time to help them to build websites for their businesses to sell items. It's time to teach each tribe to have designated plumbers and repairmen within their territories. This country needs to get them to a point where they feel like they belong, and that we for once, recognized the need to make things better. They need to know that we are evolving as a \textbf{nation} UNITED! We need to help them to place of pride and sustainability. We need to hear the voices and be honest enough to change things.*Build factories and get them equipment that will allow the tribes access to their own tools to make clothing and jewelry. We need to train family tribes for trades that allow them to cater to their own needs if that be their preference. This would allow them to evolve and provide for themselves, but also to know that there are options for training. It also opens up the American culture back to the Native American culture through art. Expression through art is a universal language and a strong tool for education.*Put a team together to figure out a path for the young ones to easily apply for college, which will begin to put a dent in this wrath of alcoholism.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small (Some) Europeans changed the rules of the game by convincing everyone to work off of the superficial metric of phenotype. I don't mind an Irish or Basque person being proud of their \textbf{ethnic} identity. Once we start getting into the "muh racial culchah, cullah, and history" territory, I lose personal respect. Overall, this is how I see it: \textbf{Race} is an ideology. As of now, it is operating as an oral tradition/religious system within our country. Like any religion, I can respect the individual's right to practice and understand the world as he sees fit, as long as it is not forced upon me \& doesn't harm me. The problem with '\textbf{race}' - it's not out of its 'New World colonialist spreading Catholicism' phase yet. It is intrusive and its fundamental adherents are often imperialistic/borderline genocidal. You can have your racial doctrine, just control your adherents and deal with that genocidal, homicidal tendency that keeps popping up (maybe make a binding canon like other religious movements). Also, don't get mad if people like me don't accept your concept of \textbf{race} for explaining human differences, or tend to see nuance when it concerns population history in Europe, Africa, or anywhere else. It's because of my own beliefs/principles that I can't bring myself to honestly celebrate \textbf{black}, white, \textbf{y\textbf{e\textbf{llow}}}, \textbf{r\textbf{ed}}, brown, or blue culture, much the same way I don't typically practice Ramadan because I'm not a Muslim.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Ethnic, Race, Red, Yellow & \cellcolor{green!5} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Ethnicity - Asian (East- China, Japan, Korea, Philippines, Vietnam), Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Ethnicity - Native-American, Nationality - Chinese, Nationality - Japanese & \cellcolor{green!5}9/236 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.814 \\  \hline

All the Native American origin stories center around Gods, animals or nature just divinely giving birth to Native Americans in the Americas.  Please enlighten me, but do any tribes have origin stories that tell of migration from another part of the Earth, in particular Asia?  After all, it is where you get your \textbf{black} hair and brown eyes.

However, it's also hard to tell the skin tone since the photographs are mostly \textbf{black} and white. Native Americans have definitely changed over the years after all of the mixing with blood. There are some Natives who still look like the typical way you would imagine a Native to look like. Others can appear light-skinned and have different features. We are all changing as we connect with other races, and that's not really a bad thing. We are still connected with our spirituality and heritage. :) And yes, dark-skin is attractive, all skin is attractive.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@cocokai I agree and understand what you are saying. That makes sense in a general way. The exception is that our intelligence, reasoning and emotions as human species is what makes us different than the rest of the animal kingdom. Original early migrations from Africa is a fact, yes. So what? How does that relate at all to why it was okay for Europeans to attempt to wipe an entire population? It wasn't for resources. It seems that you are referring to a need for a survival. They had resources in Europe. We've all heard the story of Puritans escaping religious persecution and Columbus stumbling across the ocean. At some point, it so much more than resettling into a new territory - over time or even instantly there grew a deep seated hatred that made them say - "we don't want them here" - which lead to things like sterilizations, massacres and policies that diminished Native populations. That is no longer only "migration" - that is an enemy who knows no boundaries. I wish it was so simple as claiming migration and animal kingdom yada yada.

Populations have been on the move since the beginning of time. Not only is it part of nature, it's healthy. And it's not just 'whites' who've displaced previous civilizations. Todays Japan is inhabited by a people who came from mainland Asia and displaced the native population. Throughout India and the Asian continent populations have come, replaced and yes, killed previous populations. Same with Africa and the middle east. Check out the history of Genghis Kahn and the lands he conquered, subjugated and the people's he slaughtered. And yet, it's only whites people seem to hold to this standard of behavior and only whites people think should know better. I used to work with intellectually challenged adults when I was a teenager. We were told that no matter what the 'clients' did, we were responsible. If they attacked us we would be asked to consider what we'd done wrong that caused them to behave this way. If they pooped themselves and threw their poop on other 'clients', we would be asked how we'd messed up and caused this to happen...why? Because they weren't intelligent enough to be held responsible for their own behavior. This is exactly what lies behind all political correctness. The idea that 'others' aren't really our equals and can't be held to the same standards we hold white people. Political correctness is the most toxic example of \textbf{racism} there's ever been.

And some are lineal so unless you can track your ancestry you can't belong. Also because the government developed this blood quantum there are even tribesmen that argue they are more native than someone  else and so on.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I agree on most accounts. But being told you aren't native for people who come from a native back round but don't meet the blood requirement, means more than a loss of benifits. Imagine if someone told you that your aren't apart of the culture you grew up in or your family was a part of. Of course \textbf{race} and culture are separate things, but when the government decides your not native, it feels like your stripped from your people. That isn't to say your argument is wrong, I agree with it on almost all accounts. But this is why people are angry, as time moves on native people are becoming less native, in the next 50 to 100 years there may be no 50 native people anymore. And when that time comes you can't quantify a people by blood anymore, then it's about culture and how much a person knows about it.  But native people have already experienced a loss of culture, most tribes' language is either dead or in danger. Holding onto culture is hard, and one day we'll have to come to terms that we are dying. And that is the true pain here. 500 years after the Spanish arrive in the Americas, and we've hit the breaking point. Maybe there will be a resurgence and Natives hold onto who they are for sometime longer. But you have to ask yourself, in another 100 years will Native people be anything but a memory?\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/246 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.407 \\  \hline

If they go live on a reservation, learn the language, and pay off people to say they are his parents, does that truly make him a native?Also, don't think that "because the Nazis did it" automatically makes something bad.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Yes, I think it is better for the few who manage to 1. gain fluency in a native language (far from easy to do) 2. live on the res, AND 3. find people to pose as parents, to receive aid not meant for them, than for the tribes to slowly die out because the government goes ONLY by DNA testing. (This is a hypothetical example, since there are variations on potential types of "proof" that could be used in conjunction). We are talking about impact on a macro scale here -- about the continued existence of entire tribes over time. This \textbf{weird} American obsession with a small number of people "ripping off" the system is fear-mongering and distracts from the core issue.Defining community by blood wasn't some fringe \textbf{Nazi} practice liking raising dogs, it was the cornerstone of their ideology. It is a also a false definition for what makes a community or a culture what it is - humans aren't divided into neat little DNA based packages. History and community goes into making a person part of a particular culture/ethnicity -- along with, in our present-day, the way someone looks, since people get treated according to their perceived "\textbf{race}" no matter what their personal experience.And finally, yes I did read that some tribes use DNA -- however, some googling will tell you that a lot more goes into it, often it's proving your connection to a native ancestor. And just because some tribal leadership has adopted a method doesn't make it a good one -- the blood quantum system, for example, has been used to keep out \textbf{black} folks whose ancestors were enslaved by certain native tribes.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Nazi, Race, Weird & \cellcolor{green!5} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}4/280 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.429 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I'm not quite sure how much you understand about blood testing, if you even do at all. The German Shepherd was a perfect analogy.Sorry to burst your bubble, but Nazis didn't have blood testing. In fact, the \textbf{Nazi} comparison feels really out of place. DNA was discovered in 1953, so proving anyone's bloodline back in the 1940's was basically educated guesswork and family stories. It wasn't understood, the current version is used to give aid, and the closest historical approximation was used maliciously.Meanwhile, to adapt the analogy a bit more, Service Shepherds, or rather service dogs in general, were not well understood. Yes, records of dogs assisting the \textbf{disabled} existed, but normally those came from people who bonded with the dog prior to their impairment. The Nazis used their German Shepherds to assist their owners... in hunting down people. It wasn't understood, the current version is used to give aid, and the closest historical approximation was used maliciously.Also, I checked out the article. It does \textbf{nothing} to prove your point about either Nazis or the issues with DNA testing. All I saw was cultures exercising their semi-sovereignty to decide who does and doesn't count as one of them, which I am able to respect. Sure it shunts out others, but if they were a large part of the culture of the nations that chose to shunt them, then they wouldn't have been shunted at all, which has nearly \textbf{nothing} to do with the US Federal Government since the US Fed Gov doesn't decide each nation's requirements.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Disabled, Nazi, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Age - Youngsters, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}20/259 & \cellcolor{green!27}7.722 \\  \hline

But since the Chickasaw tribe has become so successful economy wise, everybody wants to be part Chickasaw because of the benefits and programs we now have.  But you have to have an \textbf{Indian} card.  To obtain a card your great grandparents had to have had a roll number from the Dawes roll number list that was made in the early 1900s.  A lot of people around here are called white chickasaws.  If a person is 1/164th Chickasaw they are entitled to benefits.  If you stick them with a pin they would lose their Chickasaw blood. Lol.  No offense to anybody.  The \textbf{nation} helps with the government economy in many ways.  Together we thrive.  I'm 81 years \textbf{old} now and have lived through a lot of descrimination.  Only in the military was I treated as an equal.  I'm not a \textbf{racist} in any way and as a born again Christian I love everybody in a spiritual way.  It is greed.  It is all greed.  The president can't fix it.  Congress can't fix it.  The government can't fix it.  But God can.  It's all a heart thing.  The heart needs God.  God made the heart of man.  God is love.  As one writer put it,   if I had my life to live over, I would love more.  I would love others more.  I would let my love express itself in the concern for my friends, my neighbors and anyone icame in contact with.  I would let love permeate me, overcome me, overwhelm me and direct me.  I would learnthejoy of giving, the pleasure of sharing, the happiness of helping.  I would love the unwanted, the lonely the unknown, and the unloved.  Where society overlooks people, I would socialize with them.  I would go where the road isn't paved and friends are few, where need is great.    I would go where God is likely to be found. When we get to heaven, all earthly memories will disappear because there is no pain there.  We must learn to love and forgive, love and forgive.  I don't care about the past.

So no, kiddo, \textbf{nobody} is going extinct.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small +bejoang27Hahaha! I guess you don't know the definition of a species if you think the ability to inbreed is all that's required. But, let's use your logic for a moment. If being able to inbreed is the only thing necessary to declare something the same species, then it doesn't matter if the two groups inbreed or not. The species will remain intact. Native white-headed ducks ARE Ruddy ducks if they can inbreed. They are the same species in your account. So who cares? They won't go extinct by inbreeding. Their population will simply multiply. So what's the problem?See you can't have your cake and eat it too. If they are the same species, then it doesn't matter if they inbreed. If they aren't the same species, then their mating would create a new sub-species by definition. Which is what happened with our ancestors and neanderthals, humans are a sub-species of two primate groups, one neanderthals and one a creature similar to modern day humans. But what you don't understand is that races aren't species. There are no such things as "sub-races", because \textbf{race} is a social construct. The only thing that defines your \textbf{race} is who your ancestors are. You have Native ancestors, are Native. You can have more then one \textbf{race} at one time, kid. Races can't go extinct.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/222 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.351 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small There are biologists that consider neanderthals and humans to be from the same species and there are others that don't (because just like with the term "\textbf{race}", there isn't a clear line that divides different species), if you're claiming that \textbf{race} is a social construct then you'd also have to claim that species is a social construct too, either way by most definitions organisms that can produce offspring are labeled under the same species, but that's besides the point.My point is that neanderthals as a population (or as a socially constructed term or whatever you wanna call it) don't exist anymore even though most humans carry a small percentage of their DNA. Listen, why were Ruddy ducks separated from white-headed ducks? Because they wanted to preserve white-headed ducks as they REALLY are, otherwise they would've been completely genetically assimilated by Ruddy ducks and they would no longer resemble even in the slightest how white-headed ducks were originally. There's absolutely \textbf{NOTHING} wrong with wanting to preserve native americans as they originally are, call it a social construct or not. Who cares you say? Well me, and many native americans as well (and also the people that decided to separate Ruddy ducks from white-headed ducks). With this mentality you're contributing to their disappearance, but according to your logic they won't disappear because someone that is 0.00000001 native american is unquestionably native american if they say they are, which is downright absurd.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nothing, Race & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/240 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.25 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small False again."if you're claiming that \textbf{race} is a social construct then you'd also have to claim that species is a social construct too"Nope. Species are separated by genes. Races are separated by geographical locations. These are not analogous. Don't confuse yourself.But to obliterate your point officially, if you want to go that far, its easy to say the classification scientists give to different animals are not \textbf{black} and white restrictions that converge with absolute systems of measurement. Species as a whole is just a term, the reality of different life forms is often a gradient, not a fixed sequence, meaning, yes, to some degree, species and the other classification we give animals and other life forms are founded upon our qualifications, not upon a rigid system that exists in nature. Species classifications are merely tools we use to describe reality as we see it, not as it actually is. So no, its not a social construct, but a human invention of measurement and organization.  As science changes so to do these terms, while reality doesn't change."either way by most definitions organisms that can produce offspring are labeled under the same species, but that's besides the point."Again, no that's false. And no, its not beside the point. Donkeys and horses, lions and tigers, various distinct animals can mate. Clearly, they aren't the same species. Your point is simply false. If you are going to make claims further in this direction, its best you use some peer-reviewed sources. At this point, your just making things up it seems."There's absolutely \textbf{NOTHING} wrong with wanting to preserve native americans as they originally are, call it a social construct or not. "Eh, no kid. Here's where your problem is. Races don't need to be preserved "as they originally are". It sounds like you want to prevent Natives from breeding outside of their population? Are you a \textbf{Nazi} sympathizer or something? What you don't seem to get is Natives will mate with whoever they want. That's why we have mixed \textbf{race} people. Because Natives themselves decided for themselves to mate with the people they fell in love with, regardless of their \textbf{race}. Its sounds like you are trying to keep them as pure breed horses or dogs or something. Le'ts face the facts here. \textbf{Race} is not something that should or needs to be protected. People need to be protected, regardless of their \textbf{race}. If someone is harmed because of their \textbf{race}, we need to protect them. We don't need, nor should we preserve the "purity" of a \textbf{race} for any reason.  Again, \textbf{race} is a social construct, if a certain \textbf{race} is changed over time, that's fine, it doesn't matter. \textbf{Nothing} is lost. What needs to be preserved is Native culture and history, not  "pure bloods", as you'd have it. There is no more value in a person who is mixed \textbf{race} and a person who is only one \textbf{race}. None. The only reason you would want to preserve "pure bloods" is because you value them more for some reason. Which IS a problem. Just replace Natives with White people and you'll understand why your logic is sick. If you were standing here saying we need to keep white blood pure, you'd be a \textbf{Nazi}.

A social construct is a concept created by humans to help them communicate and interact with one another. That's the definition of a social construct. In this case, a social construct is a tool that is explicitly defined as a tool created by humans for social communication and interaction. The category of "species" is NOT a social construct, because it is not designed specifically for the purpose of helping humans communicate and interact with one another, it was created to help humans categorize animals and other life forms for scientific research. BOTH of these things are concepts, but one is a social construct and the other is not. There is no contradiction, you merely don't know the meaning of social construct. Now you do."If I had a \textbf{nazi} mentality I would be talking about native american supremacy and that people who are part native american (like me) are inferior."Nope again. You have a \textbf{Nazi} mentality because you believe in segregation of races to preserve their "originality". And Hitler wasn't an Aryan, yet he believed Aryan's were the best. So, thinking of yourself as lesser, doesn't keep you from idealizing another \textbf{race}. Supremacy isn't the only thing Nazis believed. It was the idea that breeds must be pure that's a \textbf{Nazi} ideology."But I'm not, I just think native americans should keep looking like native americans, but apparently that's enough for someone to report my comments, so much for free speech."Also, no.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I fail to see how species can't be considered a social construct.Definition of social construct: A social mechanism, phenomenon, or category created and developed by society; a perception of an individual, group, or idea that is 'constructed' through cultural or social practice.Lots of things can be considered social constructs under that definition, and the 17th century precursor of the modern concept of \textbf{race} was also created to categorize humans for study.'it was created to help humans categorize animals and other life forms for scientific research.'Yes, species were created by humans and we agree that they exist because we have assigned living beings that label and everyone around us agrees of the existence of species, and I could even argue that the term species also simplifies human communication by grouping animals that share similar characteristics into a single group, categorization is fundamental in language and therefore the term species does help humans communicate with one another, the fact that this concept was created to categorize something makes its purpose to help humans communicate and interact with one another.'BOTH of these things are concepts, but one is a social construct and the other is not'Definition of concept: an abstract idea; a general notion.In other words a social construct, there's a reason why a social construct can also be called a social concept."I don't believe that. By the time that many reproductions have happened, that creature will likely no longer even be human."That was a hyperbole. Would you consider someone that is 1 native American a native American? "What you value is the issue. That something is "lost" that deserves to be preserved.  That's the \textbf{Nazi} mentality."We are animals anyway, I don't see what's wrong with thinking that human races, whether they're social constructs or not, should be preserved as they really are just like we preserve endangered animals like those ducks I've mentioned a thousand times now. There are dog breeds that are extinct even though there are dogs that descend from them.You can demonize me all you want but I'm not calling for the extermination of entire races, I'm not saying non-natives are inferior, I'm not saying native americans are the master \textbf{race}, I'm saying that if they all mixed and were eventually absorbed genetically by the non-native population they would be replaced with something different that couldn't be considered a native American anymore, that mixed population would obviously still be a part of the bigger concept "human \textbf{race}" but they wouldn't be native americans anymore.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nazi, Race & \cellcolor{green!27} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}4/426 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.939 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The question is problematic on a number of levels. First, America is a shorthand term referring to the United States of America. There were many European nations that were attempting to establish colonies in the Americas (some were more successful than others). Natives started losing land to colonial powers a century and a half before the founding of the USA. And "stealing" can be too simplistic to describe the process of aboriginal dispossession. Land was acquired by purchase, lost as a result of open warfare, treaties, fraud, bureaucratic occupation, coercion/threats, etc. There was theft of land in some instances. But, not all land acquired by colonists and Americans was technically stolen either. However, on a related topic: I see a \textbf{common} response from usually conservative White American males that tend to take their views to the other extreme, by cultural default - namely, they take up the position that there was no "rightful ownership" by tribes anyway. It is the standard "might makes right" mentality that has been rationalizing colonization and domination efforts for many generations. This represents a deep cultural legacy and entrenched social conditioning.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Common & \cellcolor{green!27}Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}1/186 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.538 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I hope to be that Native American \textbf{woman} president some day. Majored in Political Science to hold office, and was the founder of the Tea Party, headed up the TN Libertarian Party for over 22 yrs, still work in politics. I run End Times Prophecy News Update, Carrie Geren Scoggins webcast. Please go to my pg and find my playlist of videos, my most recent, "Abortion Is Not A Choice Issue, As It Is Not A Victimless Crime, Carrie Geren Scoggins," and "There Is NO Freedom From Religion, Carrie Geren Scoggins," are 2 good videos representing my work.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    In the state of Tennessee, with those of us that are Cherokee, such as myself, we are registered on a registry, which began dating back to the Trail of Tears, and from that point, the family genealogy was kept up with by the state. I assume this is what the speaker means by the state knowing our "quantum," though those terms are not used in Tennessee.  My family's history is on the data base, and the state has records of my whole genealogy. I believe that this was done with \textbf{racist} motives back when the record keeping began, as those that were Native Americans were not only brought in through the back door in Tennessee, but they were either forced to leave, or had to prove that they were \textbf{disabled} and could not go on the infamous Trail Of Tears. Why so many registered Native Americans did not go to Oklahoma, was that the civil war was on during the taking of the lands, and if the children were off fighting the war, the \textbf{elderly} family members were allowed to stay on their land. Later came the land grab via marriage laws, where if a \textbf{woman} was a Native American, the state would give a white man 500 acres of Native American, Cherokee lands, to any man that would marry the \textbf{woman}.  The state began breeding us out, and using our own land in payment to any white man that would take a Native American bride, in order to carry out this movement.  This ended in Cleveland, TN area, the Aimohee District of the original Cherokee \textbf{Nation}, left with many mixed families, and almost no family in the area without being partially Cherokee.  My own family is on the Lee Registry, and our family has been kept on logs and files since the civil war era, which today is still done under the guise of getting state money, land in a 'rez,' or reservation, and other benefits that were the 'trade,' for our lands.  These are not "entitlements," as the state took land in trade for this, so note that this is not welfare. I always feel the need to point this out, as Native Americans are now hated due to getting state funds, though this was the trade off from the state, initiated by the US government, and not by the Native Americans.  I personally have had people accuse me of getting my college tuition paid for due to being Cherokee, as recently as last week, and I find this as a typical insult degrading my own triumph of hard work putting my own self through college.  I was the brunt of hearing insults about Cherokee's now having casinos on their land, this came from my now x in-laws, and many others. There are many insults hurled at Native Americans, and the media never tackles these racial issues, because as the young boy in this video stated, people feel as though all the Native Americans are now dead.  In the end, I \textbf{colored} my hair back dark, because I realized that I did not represent my own heritage, my own family, and that I was conforming to what I felt that I needed to do to be in the media.  I heard a \textbf{woman} say " I changed my mind on getting a nose job, because I realized that I had my dad's nose, and changing was losing my own family history."  I took this to heart, as being Cherokee, I have the large nose, and my hair was always the darkest \textbf{black}, and to change this, is separating myself from my family line, from my heritage, and from who we are.  When given a choice now, I too would refuse the nose jobs, or changing my hair color to make me appear more white, to 'fit in.'  During my junior high years my mother did bleach my hair, and stated clearly that it was so that I would look more white, and it was in hopes of stopping the racial attacks at school from those believing that I was Hispanic.  One can hide their \textbf{race}, they can "tone it down," but as an adult, I have decided that I am not going around disguised as a white person. I have had a greater insult in my now loss of a love, David Wilcock, when he left me for a white \textbf{woman} claiming to be a Shaman, when in reality, I am the real blood line Shaman.  That is when I said that I never wanted to lighten my hair to look white-r, to conform, again, no matter the cost. When society pushes a white Shaman, because we the Native Americans are not considered 'good enough,' to represent our own religion, it's time to cut them off, and kick them out of our lives.  The radio stations allow white people to claim our religion, take our leadership positions, but they can never take our pride.

It's not just a one way, it goes both ways And since your Arabic like you said, Muslims have a long history of Wars, Genocide and Slavery So the Arabic's are not innocent A chronological list of battles and wars across the Islamic World and beyond, from the seventh century to the present spans at least 1,432 years of Islamic history. There have been 254 campaigns in total, averaging an outbreak of conflict every 5.64 years. Although large parts of the Muslim world are very safe from war, a few countries in the Near East, Africa and South Asia are quite vulnerable to conflict. In addition persecution of the Muslim community also currently presents a danger in lands such as India and Serbia, which are not listed as parts of battles or wars (such as the Gujurat pogrom in 2002 in India). The most peaceful period was between the eighth and tenth centuries, in the middle of the Islamic Golden \textbf{Age} (a cultural, intellectual, political and technologically advanced \textbf{age}), and the worst during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries during the White European imperial \textbf{age}. The Early Middle-ages (7th-10th Centuries) saw twenty-seven campaigns, the High Middle-ages (11th-13th Centuries) thirty-seven campaigns, the Late Middle-ages (14th-16th) sixty-one campaigns, and in the Contemporary Era (18th-19th Centuries) fifty-nine campaigns, with the Post-Early Modern Era (19th-20th Centuries) registering at least eighty-seven campaigns in total.The list of battles in not fully complete and only includes additions made in Alexander Mikaberidze's "Conflict and Conquest in the Islamic World: A Historical Encyclopedia"' (where for example the Siege of Silistria (1854), is not mentioned). However the number of campaigns appears accurate and are listed chronologically. Certain campaigns known elsewhere may also have names different to those remembered in Islamic history. In addition there are more than several notable battles in Islamic history that have had several important implications in relation to Islamic warfare. Some of the most famous battles have included Yarmouk, (636), Masts (655), Xeres (711),  (1071), Maritsa (1371), Nicopolis (1396), Mohacs (1526), Preveza (1538), Algiers (1541), 2nd Panipat (1556), Djerba (1560), 3rd Panipat (1761), Pollilur (1780), Gallipoli (1915), Kashmir (1947) and Chechnya (1994). Some of the most famous campaigns have consisted of the Turkish War of Independence (1919-1922) and the advent of the Crusades (1096-1272) in which the Muslims eventually triumphed. Throughout Islamic history, some notable weapons were also invented during warfare such as the torpedo, giant bombards, trebuchets, rockets and scimitars.7th Century (55 Battles)[1]Total Campaigns: 254, Total Battles: 1,423Muslim Campaign (624-630)Battle of Badr (624)Battle of Uhud (625)Battle of Medina (627)Battle of Khaybar (628)Battle of Mecca (630)The Syrian Conquest (629-639)Battle of Muta (629)Battle of Ajnadin (634)Battle of Bosra (634)Battle of Marj Rahit (634)Battle of Wadi al-Arabah (634)Battle of Yarmuk (634)Battle of Damascus (635)Battle of Fihl (635)Battle of Marj as-Suffar (635)Battle of Yarmuk (636)Battle of Jerusalem (638)Battle of Aleppo (639)Muslim Civil Wars (632-763)Battle of Buzakha (632)Battle of Dhu al Quassa (633)Battle of Akraba (633)Battle of Camel (656)Battle of Siffin (657)Battle of Karbala (680)Battle of Harra (683)Battle of Mecca (683)Battle of Medina (683)Battle of Marj Rahit (684)Battle of Mecca (692)Iraq Conquest (633-637)Battle of Hafir (633)Battle of Hira (633)Battle of Mazar (633)Battle of Ullais (633)Battle of Walaja (633)Battle of Ain Tamar (634)Battle of Babylon (634)Battle of Bridge (634)Battle of Firadz (634)Battle of Nimaraq (634)Battle of Buwayb (635)Battle of Qadisiyya (636)Battle of Jalula (637)Battle of Madain (637)Egypt Conquest (640-642)Battle of Heliopolis (640)Battle of Pelusium (640)Battle of Babylon (640-641)Battle of Alexandria (641-642)Persian ConquestBattle of Nehavend (641)Egyptian-Nubian WarsBattle of Nubia (641-652)Byzantine-Muslim Wars (645-739)Battle of Alexandria (645)Battle of Mount Phoenix (654)Battle of Amorium (669)Battle of Syllaeum (677)Battle of Sebastopolis (692)North \textbf{African} Conquest (647-698)Battle of Sufetula (647)Battle of Biskra (683)Battle of Mams (688)Battle of Carthage (697-698) list goes on till this very day !\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African, Age & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!5}4/714 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.56 \\  \hline

The "white man" is propped up as the thing to dismantle. It's very interesting how aggressive this media is. Yes, that's probably because straight white men have oppressed every \textbf{race} on Earth. They've colonized or occupied every country in the world but five. In their own countries they facilitated the brutal systematic oppression of women, people of color, and \textbf{L\textbf{G\textbf{BT}}}. These groups are now amassing more political, social, cultural, and economic power as a result of ideologies that exist to generate empowerment in opposition to straight white male hegemony. >I'm not sure if it's bolstered by President Trump being in power, Trump is a white nationalist who represents straight white male privilege. He has given us all a \textbf{common} enemy to unite against and simultaneously exposed which people in society are amenable or outright supportive of white supremacy. >but it very much appears to be politically motivated.Oh, of course it is. We want to take political power from you. We're getting there too. By 2040 white people will be a minority in America. Additionally, women, \textbf{L\textbf{G\textbf{BT}}}, and people of color are coalescing on the left, while white men are largely sticking to the right. Also, millennial are generally more liberal than any previous generation (which is normal). Eventually, conservative white men who are prone towards white supremacism will find themselves largely outnumbered and will necessarily cede power.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Common, Engineers, LGBT, Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General, Nationality - General, Sexual Identity - General, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality, Sexual Identity - Transexuality, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}9/246 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.659 \\  \hline

I can't believe people claim \textbf{racism} isn't a problem. I acknowledge the current capital people have is inherited and not fair. The distribution of resources is not fair.

The Federal gov't was sued by over 100 tribes, and ended up settling for over 3 billion dollars in 2009.To Natives, land is not simply a property value or a piece of real estate.
