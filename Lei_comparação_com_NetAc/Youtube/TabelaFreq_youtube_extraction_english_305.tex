The leftists new norm is if you're not actively fighting against the evil \textbf{racist} right, you must be unconsciously \textbf{racist}. So they fight, causing the divide.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small What you are asking for is a \textbf{nationalism} with not energy.  Team sports is not the endall to patriotism.  If you \textbf{nation} has interests that are not in the interest of others you can still support your \textbf{nation}.  The Poles have thier own \textbf{nation} and it is thier choice if they want any other people in thier state.  You are wrong here.   People do not come before the interests of a sovereign \textbf{nation}.  You want a patriotism with out a bite.  If a people threatens the stability and happiness of another then they will have to suffer not being a part of the body politic.  This is final.  If a foreigner brings thier children with them into another country then they are risking those children themselves.  Every person is not sacred.    If we were to only use your kind of patriotism then we would lay ourselves open to the interests of others to our own detriment.   \textbf{Racism} is ugly, but \textbf{nationalism} does not equal \textbf{racism} unless some group of others threatens your state.  Get it.  \textbf{Racism} is a reaction.   And the idea that the needs of the left are indelibly correct is not ture.  There are Hitler's in the world and there are Stalin's as well.  Both are equally dangerous.   Everyone the best thing is to keep to the middle and love your country fist.  The duty of a people is to thier \textbf{nation} and the duty of a \textbf{nation} is to it's people.  That is  primary.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Patriotism in America cannot be \textbf{racist}, by definition, because America is the only country that is not founded on \textbf{race} but on a creed, which is essentially encapsulated in Thomas Jefferson's Declaration of Independence and expounded upon in James Madison's Constitution.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The  very idea of \textbf{nationalism} (the right of nation-states to exist) is inherent to classical liberalism, though admittedly not exclusive to it.  Still, this means when people bash the idea of nation-states, they also bash the things having nation-states have given us thanks to the broad number which have been classically liberal: individual (human) rights, economic prosperity unprecedented in world history, relative peace when compared to historical norms between non-(classically) liberal states.   So when I hear people attack \textbf{nationalism}, I hear them telling me I don't deserve human rights, money in my pocket or a stable place to raise my kids.  Especially when those same people are championing socialism, which blatantly calls for the destruction of all individual rights and absolute power by a centralized state.  In other words, total oppression and tyranny.  Slavery.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nationalism & \cellcolor{green!5}Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/134 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.493 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The death of god has created in men an unholy trinity; \textbf{race},\textbf{sex} and power. But the part where people get it wrong is that \textbf{nationality} is stronger in its weakness than ethnology is in its strength. Nationhood is a product of spirit, something your eye cannot see or make a \textbf{race} of. Scottish \textbf{nationalism} was born in independence, Ireland was born in subjugation. It was H.G. Wells' idea to rid of nations, because someone would war against the utopian state. Rome has conquered Gaul, but Ireland has conquered races. Spaniards, Scottish, Norman, even Cromwellian soldiers have become Irish. When Ireland wasn't even a political identity it was stronger than the foundations of "The Theory of Races." J.R.R. Tolkien wanted to be a founder of English legend or folklore, Ireland has had legends from the beginning because its human.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nationalism, Nationality, Race, Sex & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General, Gender - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}5/138 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.623 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Patriotism is synonymous with Nationalist.  And the definition of nationalist was co opted and changed.  According to britanicca until 2008 it meant  to support industrial modernization in a \textbf{nation} and 0romote the national interest,  meaning better jobs, less crime, etc. The crime went up in 2016 before trump was elected and it barely dropped in 2015 when Obama inspired BLM and blacks were attacking whites. According to the FBI crime dropped among whites but \textbf{black} on \textbf{black} crime and suicides increased.  Maxine waters called for violence in 2017 and most of all hate cromes were directed at whites, especially Jewish people.  So Democrats have become more violent and are marginalizing the right, exactly as Hitler did to the Jews.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Nation & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/119 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.521 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small What passes as \textbf{nationalism} in our time is a reaction to leftist efforts to flood Europe and the Anglosphere with mass immigration  and to eliminate their political opposition.  Rather than recognizing their own failures and abuses, including censorship, political suppression and political violence, leftists choose to mischaracterize their opposition as extremists, when most of their opposition merely seeks to preserve the cohesiveness and classical liberal values of post-WW2 Western Civilization.  When the left points with alarm at the marginalized fringe far right, they only lose more credibility.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nationalism & \cellcolor{green!27}Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/87 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.149 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Nationalism is allegiance to the \textbf{Nation}. Patriotism is allegiance to the State. Patriotism is sometimes called civic \textbf{nationalism}. So a Syrian can be a German patriot (yes, it happens) but he's not loyal to the German \textbf{Nation}, he's loyal to the German State and the Germans are his compatriots. In multinational empires, nationalists fight patriots to gain independence. Since the attitude of the State towards Europeans in the global super-market that used to be called Western Civilization is best described as hateful schizophrenia, no self-respecting European man can be a patriot. He can only be a nationalist.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nation, Nationalism & \cellcolor{green!27}Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}8/97 & \cellcolor{green!27}8.247 \\  \hline

The regressive, post-leftist worldview wrongly assumes that all Europeans are eternal oppressors, and all non-Europeans, especially Muslims, are eternal victims.  In reality, Europe has more often been on the defence against the totalitarian, expansionist ambitions of Muslim nations.  The Crusades only began after centuries of unchecked Islamic conquest that swallowed up the majority of Roman ('Byzantine', if you're historically illiterate) land, including the entirety of the Iberian Peninsula.   While Western Europe has been free of serious Islamist threats since 1492, it has been a perpetual danger to the continent's Eastern region, with people alive today who were born when the Ottoman flag flew over Greek, Armenian, Magyar, and Slavic nations.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Imperialist, Nationalism & \cellcolor{green!27} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/184 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.087 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small American \textbf{Nationalism} cloaks the issue: the preponderance of under-educated White men living in the Rust Belt who have a bleak economic outlook. And who can blame them? This is not going away. These White men end up cozying up to Nativism as a cure-all for their economic insecurities, blaming minorities and immigrants for the loss of manufacturing jobs. These White men do not recognize that the corporate playbook of outsourcing quality manufacturing jobs is the culprit. Corporate profits have conspired to eliminate these cushy jobs. And the government has had its hand in this as well, with trade agreements, such as NAFTA, that make outsourcing a boon for outsourced labor. What is also being ignored is that high paying careers that require a degree are also being outsourced. Now the question is, where will this lead? War, as we saw in WWII? Not likely. The only time we'll have war is if it more profitable to wage war than to maintain economic stability. Corporations run the western world. And only war that can occur while maintaining economic stability can occur. War with China? No, they are the cheap labor force of the West. War with NK? Yes, it could happen because this would not destabilize the West. War with China over Taiwan? No, because Taiwan is part of the economic system War in the Middle East? Yes, because as long as oil is still flowing (through whatever hands) the economies of the world's economic leaders will continue to prosper. Problems for Poland? Yes, because corporate and banking interests are no strangers to Jewish leaders. Anti-Muslim sentiment? This will not hurt the \textbf{Nationalism} because Muslims are marginalized people.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small In short, patriotism is a personal form of love for one's country. \textbf{Nationalism} is that patriotism, that love for your country politically applied in order to protect and preserve that which you love and respect about your country. "Country" is primarily the people that reside within the borders of a land, so applied \textbf{Nationalism} is just using the resources at one's disposal to protect the people you love and respect. \textbf{Nothing} wrong or "idiotic" about it.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nationalism, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/76 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.947 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small '\textbf{Nationalism}, originally a progressive movement, replaced the bonds of feudalism and absolutism. The average man today obtains his sense of identity from his belonging to a \textbf{nation}, rather than from his being a "Son of Man." His objectivity, that is, his reason, is warped by this fixation. He judges the "stranger" with different criteria than the members of his own clan. His feelings toward the stranger are equally warped. Those who are not "familiar" by bonds of blood and soil (expressed a \textbf{common} language, customs, food, song, etc.) are looked upon with suspicion, and paranoid delusions about them can spring up at the slightest provocation. This incestuous fixation not only poisons the relationship of the individual to the stranger, but to the members of his own clan and to himself. The person who has not freed himself from the ties to blood and soil is not yet fully born as a human being; his capacity for love and reason are crippled; he does not experience himself nor his fellow man in their-and his own-human reality.\textbf{Nationalism} is our form of incest, is our idolatry, is our insanity. 'Patriotism' is its cult...Just as love for one individual which excludes the love for others is not love, love for one's country which is not part of one's love for humanity is not love, but idolatrous worship.' ― Erich Fromm\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Common, Nation, Nationalism & \cellcolor{green!5}Nationality - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}3/227 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.322 \\  \hline

Patriotism is love and devotion for your country, \textbf{nationalism} is love and devotion for your country, even at the expense of other countries etc. They are the same thing, one just has a fuller definition. for instance a patriot could have love and devotion in spite of other countries or even their own compatriots feeling otherwise.... which would by definition turn a patriot into a nationalist. \textbf{nationalism} is simply patriotism, at a more extreme level.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nationalism & \cellcolor{green!5}Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}4/104 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.846 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I disregard this viewpoint completely. Both \textbf{Nationalism} and Patriotism are pretty much the same thing. If you'd go by dictionary obvisuly even synonyms have something to differ from each other the problem is not a language one here.

Though it's clear that leftists and liberal communists are never fond of \textbf{nationalism} and pro - government/state democratic establishment, they want a totalirian government which controls everything. However in India they blame the current government to be the same and argue the \textbf{nationalism} of  rightwingers by twisting the debate of Patriotism as per their convenience.P.S.

I can imagine the murder and rape rates going up and my own country having more no-go zones.  A country that my ancestors fought and died for and I'm no longer able to be in certain places.

It is not my duty to do anything to mitigate human suffering in destabilized parts of the world.  I would if it actually helped but humanitarian aid does very little as it proposes to do.

Billions in aid to famine victims to feed them, house them, give them prosthetics.  But what does it matter when they starve to death anyways, are shot and killed, or sold into prostitution?
