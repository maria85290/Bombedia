  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Black hybrids like aliens police don't care!Latest answer\textbf{Black}, \textbf{black} second generation, \textbf{black} bastard must all get out of China!  With the reform and opening up, the overall progress of the country, \textbf{black} people who want to make money and have a place of stability come to our country. These \textbf{black} people have never returned to their hometown to serve their hometown, build their own country, and build the concept of Africa. They only know that they go to places that are easy to live in, seek personal interests in stable places, reside in other \textbf{ethnic} groups. China has the fastest development, China is open, China and Africa are friendly, Chinese women are beautiful and free, etc. Let these \textbf{black} people stay away from their hometown and try every means to seek to settle in China!  In Guangzhou alone, the number of \textbf{African} blacks, whether legally or illegally, is at least 300,000, of which more than 20,000 are legal immigrants and the rest are all illegal immigrants or visa expired. \textbf{Black} males account for more than 90 and are increasing at a rate of 30-40 every year like viruses. Even now they are living in China.  One in ten Guangzhou people is \textbf{black}. This is a tragic phenomenon. It is a certainty that \textbf{black} people will become the 57th \textbf{ethnic} group of the Chinese \textbf{nation}. \textbf{Black} people flock to bars and karaoke bars at night and harass women indiscriminately on the campus streets. Unmarried or married, basically, at least 60 of Guangzhou's women have been harassed by \textbf{black} people. Guangzhou's mixed-\textbf{race} population has increased significantly. There have been many conflicts between \textbf{y\textbf{e\textbf{llow}}} and \textbf{black} mixed-\textbf{race} blacks on campus.  The parasitic surname \textbf{race} is a current liability of any country. Former US President Nixon also used words similar to Despairs to describe \textbf{black} people. They are \textbf{African}-Americans, have no great civilization, have no great scientists, and the crime rate is 7-8 times higher than that of white people. They will only use their super-strong ability to mix with local women to obtain the right of abode or their \textbf{nationality} to parasitic with this \textbf{nation}. Maybe they can play basketball, sing and rap and then play with your women at ease. Eating your family's food is not the same for our family. Especially those \textbf{black} people who are active in our media need to be banned!  However, in China, there should never be a large number of \textbf{black} people. If the \textbf{ethnic} origin of the Han people is really polluted by chimpanzees, the Qin and Han masters cry to death, the Tang and Song gifted scholars cry to death, the three great generals cry to death, the four great beauties cry to death, Zhuge Liang cry to death, the Pan An Song Yu cry to death, the Tang and Song eight people cry to death, the Qin Huai eight Yan cry to death, the Ran Min cry to death, the low quality of the \textbf{black} people. Look at the national \textbf{race} * * in France and England, it is because some countries in Western Europe ignored the restrictions on foreign immigration and the punishment for smuggling, and are now quickly occupied by the rapidly reproducing \textbf{black} people and Arabs. Now Britain and France regret it too late!  And blacks are recognized as the \textbf{race} with the worst quality. In many countries, the crime rate in \textbf{black} communities is the highest and most chaotic. Half of the prisons in Guangzhou and Dongguan are \textbf{black}.  \textbf{Black} people occupied France, and former romantic city is now banlieue 13!  \textbf{Black} people occupied Haiti and the richest region in the western hemisphere became the poorest region in the western hemisphere.  \textbf{Black} people have occupied South Africa. In the past, bright pearl was praised as rainbow country and became the AIDS capital of the world.  \textbf{Black} people have occupied Detroit, and the once beautiful automobile city has become the crime capital of the United States.  \textbf{Black} people have occupied Rhodesia, which is now the region with the highest inflation in the world!  From the perspective of the civilization process, backward civilizations are always eliminated. Civilized countries in Asia and Europe always survive through constant wars and competitions to create a prosperous world civilization. \textbf{Black} people rely on civilization parasitism instead of changing their own progress.  The most important thing is the irreversibility of low IQ after mixing blood with \textbf{black} people!  Tens of thousands of years of evolutionary history have been completely retrograded to the barbaric animal \textbf{age} only by the mixed \textbf{race} of blacks. This is really an unprecedented retrogression of civilization and even brings disaster of extinction to civilization itself.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African, Age, Black, Ethnic, Nation, Nationality, Race, Yellow & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Ethnicity - Asian (East- China, Japan, Korea, Philippines, Vietnam), Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Nationality - Chinese, Nationality - General, Nationality - Japanese & \cellcolor{green!5}40/775 & \cellcolor{green!5}5.161 \\  \hline

It takes like 8 months (even though it's automatic) and everything backlogs in Nantes. These so called "unwanted immigrants" are not, NOT-FRENCH. Now if you're talking about the ones from, I don't know, Mars, or the former ENGLISH colonies, then that's different....I mean, people are all up in arms about France getting full of, say, Syrian immigrants - well Syria was part of the French Empire until about 1941. There'd still be loads of people born in Syria since then who had a parent born there when it was still "French."

The \textbf{race} issue in France surely exists, but they are able to think about it in a mature way because they consider French citizens as French before considering skintones.  Some might say that diminishes outside cultures, but I imagine it's much better than the millions of \textbf{w\textbf{hite trash}} idiots in America who would rather keep \textbf{black} people out of sight in prisons and graves.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small As a french \textbf{black} person, I have to disagree. I feel that \textbf{racism} just express itself differently. In France, we assume that all \textbf{black} french are africans and not \textbf{african} descents. It creates that feeling that \textbf{black}=foreigners, allowing them to ignore the political issue that \textbf{race} is. There has been \textbf{black} people on the French territory for 300 years (eventhough that territory greatly diminished). You would conceed that after 300 hundread years, we're not really foreigners.In France, talking about \textbf{race} is being \textbf{racist}; irony: we can't talk about \textbf{race} issues. It has become taboo. Instead of that, we talk about "immigrants" and "the ghetto youth". Ignoring at the same time that the poorest part of the population is \textbf{black} and arabe, that most of our convicted are \textbf{black} and arabe, that by being \textbf{black} or arabe you will be less pay, have a harder time finding a job and etc and etc.And because we are a less violent country than the USA (certainly because of gun control and our police control), our cops are just not as violent as yours. That doesn't stop them from harassing \textbf{black} mens(ID controls is all that they can do, thank god!).Finally, the way we're dealing with Islam is \textbf{racist}.

They are not running away from the French. They are running to France for protection and security; because it is the French and other Europeans who are willing to help them, not other \textbf{African} countries.There are many Africans who want to go to France or other European countries because they want their kids to grow up in civilised countries where they do not have to be afraid all the time. They want their kids to have a stable home and a good education. They know they can find that in France. That is why Africans migrate to France and French people do not migrate to Africa. And if the cult of Islamic savages you seem to admire were to prevail over Europe, then Africans would no longer have any safe harbour to seek refuge. But it won't. Because it is already reaching a tipping point white European countries beginning to close their borders. And when they do that, your cult of semi-literate stone-age, inbreds will be powerless.

But they already fell apart within days when confronted with Russian forces. Putin has already proved what a paper tiger ISIS is.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@kingofpendragon This is what Mali King Gezo of Dahomey said to French emissaries pushing for the abolition of slavery."Slavery is the wealth and power of our Kingdom. We will never abandon it."The French colonised nearly all of his empire anyway. They brought the rule of law, modern technologies of all kinds, and principles of French enlightenment and they banned slavery outright. A little further North, the British were doing the same. That is why so many smaller tribes along the so called slave coasts of west Africa supported the Europeans when they arrived.And yes the Moors made great advances in some areas, particularly mathematics. So too did the Egyptians. They were great empires in their own times. The Moors conquered much of Southern Europe at one point, stealing that which did not belong to them.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@kingofpendragon Most of your post is incoherent and historically inaccurate gibberish. But I will clear up some of the bizarre claims you made anyway just in case anyone else in the thread is interested.The Haiti revolt was much more complicated than your simplistic white versus \textbf{black} analysis. Whites and blacks fought on both sides. The war was a combination of various conflicts. On the side of the slaves, there were huge numbers of Spanish imperialists and French Royalists. Against them there were slave owners and traders, both \textbf{black} and white; along with French Republicans and Spanish troops. The British later also got involved supporting the independence movement. The war also contained several sub-conflicts including a brief civil war between blacks and mullatos. To cast this mess as a simple slave versus owner, or \textbf{black} versus white struggle says more about how your mind works than it does about the Haiti war. You simply see only what you want to see. You then claim that the main beneficiaries of the Mali slave trade were the French! Really? If that were true do you really think the French would have abolished it? Actually the main beneficiaries of the Mali slave empire were the Mali elites. The French by that time did not own slaves and did not trade in slaves. They did not benefit from the \textbf{African} slave trade in any way. The \textbf{African} slave trade had been booming long before any Europeans arrived in Africa and long before the Industrial Revolution. Most of the \textbf{African} Kingdoms sold slaves to other \textbf{African} kingdoms or to Arab traders further north. Europeans did not own slaves. Rich Europeans had paid servants instead and those servants were usually other Europeans. It was not British slave traders who first hooked into this trade and took it across the Atlantic as you claimed; it was Portuguese traders followed by Dutch. The British came much later. Just so you know. Even at the height of the Trans-Atlantic slave trade, there were far more \textbf{African} slaves owned by other Africans and even more owned by Arabs, than there ever were in the Americas. By the early 1800s, slavery, though never really a feature of European societies anyway, had been abolished by every European country. The United States followed in 1865. From 1865, no European or American power allowed slavery in any of its possessions. But slavery still boomed across Africa and millions of people were still being sold into slavery by \textbf{African} slave kingdoms. The so called 'scramble for Africa' began in 1881, long after slavery had already been abolished across the white world, and as European powers quickly divided up the continent they began to abolish slavery and slave trading wherever they found it. The \textbf{African} Kingdoms fought hard against this but they were no match for superior European military force. In Mali for example, millions of slaves were freed as the French colonies expanded inland and the slave centres all along the Niger River were shut down. The British did the same in what is now Nigeria and on the Gold coast. The vast majority of North-West Africa, where most American slaves had come from, had been cleared of slavery by the turn of the twentieth century, by the French. Of course the Europeans were not in Africa to help. They were there with the same aims of any empire in history, including the \textbf{African} ones, to plunder resources. They brought their own injustices. But only in Belgian held territory were people no better off under European than \textbf{African} rule. The atrocities committed by the Belgians were legendary; just as savage as those committed by the Kinlaza and Kimpanzu Kingdoms which had previously ruled the area. In the Congo the arrival of the Belgians was a case of – 'Meet the new boss – same as the \textbf{old} one.'But across most of the rest of Africa the new boss, though exploitative and unjust, was far less so than the barbaric kingdoms which had preceded him: Which is why most \textbf{African} people were quite happy to see those \textbf{old} kingdoms wiped out. But what about those \textbf{African} territories which retained some form of nominal independence? Well the people there were not so lucky. The Ethiopian Empire was forced to abolish slavery by Italy in 1902, although the practise remained widespread throughout large parts of it where Italian influence was not strong. Niger gained its independence from France in 1958 and slavery immediately became legal again. Niger did not finally abolish slavery until 2003. Mauritania also reintroduced slavery when the French moved out. Slavery was abolished there again after UN sanctions in 2007. So yes: Europeans engaged in slavery, just not on anything like the same scale as the Africans did. And in the end it was Europeans, not Africans that ended slavery, not Africans. And various forms of slavery still exist in some places, mostly in Africa and the Muslim world even though it is illegal; but it is certainly not tolerated in Europe or North America.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African, Black, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!5}16/841 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.902 \\  \hline

If you really think that spewing hatred at white people and calling for young \textbf{black} men to kill police officers will hurt anyone other than \textbf{black} communities then you are deluded. Martin Luther King must be rolling in his grave. So yes it is a work in progress in America. So far the progress has all been backwards. BLM have tarnished the image of \textbf{black} people across the USA by living up to exactly the kinds of negative stereotypes you describe. Americans are treated nightly to scenes of mobs of \textbf{black} youths thrashing \textbf{black} neighbourhoods, looting \textbf{black} businesses and beating any white people they can find.Sure: That is really going to help \textbf{black} people in America. \textbf{Race} relations are at their worst in America since the 1960s and it is all thanks to BLM.

There is not less \textbf{ethnic} trouble in france, the only difference is that ppl, here are not delivered with an incredible amount of weapons from other western countries to kill each other. And no, not every \textbf{african} country is living a civil war, living there can be even better than living in France because the mentalities are different, a sense of fraternity that make these countries better to live in. Western countries' standards are said to be the reference but they are not a insurance of a better life. What you say really shows you've nerver been in any \textbf{african} country.They might not be stupid but you might be surprised by their beliefs on France, try to speak with some africans and you'll see, what I said is a true fact.My point was exactly what I said, yes some are leaving France for GB but a lot go back to their countries right after graduating. One of the reasons why many dont go back is because they often cant afford the trip back so yes they build a life in the country.Im not saying everyone thinks like that I was clearly talking about the society that keeps on perpetuating these stereotypes. \textbf{Black} ppl are rarely seen in the media or movies if not in the constant role of poor ghetto ppl, I dont know about your country but Im telling about what is true in mine. The problem is that we are already part of the room but we are never looked at .Ok give me names. Because indeed \textbf{black} ppl in the french artistry are everywhere but I never really see them, they are rarely promoted, odd.I wasnt talking about BLM, but on that I think you are wrong, maybe some ppl have been violent and agressive but the intention behind that was for \textbf{black} ppl to not be treated like less than from the american society. BLM has never been about hating on white ppl but on bringing up \textbf{black} ppl. They never called to kill police officers, deranged people did that by themselves, young people rioting is not caused by BLM but by the police killing \textbf{black} people so there your point is invalid. Comparing BLM to KKK is outrageous and quite offensive honestly.When I said they created instittutions I was refering to the \textbf{black} movies industry or BET.You just made my point once again! You disagreeing with does not make you ignorant but you saying false facts does! I get that you are a minority but re read what I said, being white can trully help you blend in, here in France so many ppl come from immigration, spanish, german, italian,portuguese etc and Im not saying they are not targeted as minorities but they blend in, ppl dont pay that much attention because they are white, but again as I said, as visible minority, which means, ppl "of colour"  we have a completely different experience! One you obviously cant understand. I never said that we dont adapt to french culture, we have , it's been generations now, yet somehow all the things I said above are still going on.

They were just colonised by other Africans, and the slave kingdoms of pre-European Africa were often even more oppressive and barbaric than the European colonisers who came later. I don't deny that Europeans exploited Africa for their own benefit. I am simply pointing out that every country or kingdom that has become powerful enough, usually represses and exploits its weaker neighbours. Africans, Asians, American Indians and every other culture in the world. They all did it.What was the first thing Europeans did when they began the \textbf{race} to colonise Africa in 1880? They abolished slavery. The \textbf{African} kingdoms fought to keep slavery. They were after all built upon it.

It was the French who brought the rule of law, the principles of enlightenment and the concept of human rights; none of which had previously existed in the horrifically brutal \textbf{African} kingdoms. The French were not there as an act of charity.

But the French left most of those territories in far better shape than they found them, and they still support them with massive amounts of funding, industry and jobs.Of course all empires are exploitative and the French one was no exception. It is often air-brushed from history that Africans had always been colonised, just like Europeans. Before the rapid colonisation of Africa by Europeans in the late 1800s; Africans had been colonised by other Africans and Europeans by other Europeans.

I said that many former colonial powers spend massive amounts on foreign aid. The European ones at least: I never said that any country depended on French aid; just that it helps a lot of them.You projected your own narrow prejudice onto what you believe I think, and you make it clear that you make that judgement based on the colour of my skin. And while you talk about 'ignorant white people,' you have the \textbf{blind} arrogance to imply that I am some kind of \textbf{racist}. I was not talking about any \textbf{race} like that. I was not stereotyping any \textbf{race} at all. You were. I suggest you read your own words, look in the mirror and ask yourself which of us is the \textbf{racist}.'The aid distribution is not fair the money goes back in double to their own banks you can read how the so called aid benefits the countries who give for other countries. There are books and videos which provide with some good evidences you can take look how it works.'I do know how it works. I also know about corrupt banks and corrupt companies and corrupt politicians: These are not exclusively the preserve of white people you know. Are you really suggesting that governments in Africa are not corrupt? The message from you is very clear: That white people did bad things in the past and now they owe a debt to their former colonies. I outlined some of the complicated history behind your naieve claim in order to point out that \textbf{black} people were just as guilty of doing bad things. You do not seem to believe that \textbf{black} people have the same responsibility to accept responsibility: Better by far to just blame an entire \textbf{race}. My point was very clear: That colonialism, slavery, corruption and exploitation are human issues: They are perpetrated by people of all colours and people of all colours have also been the victims of them at different times. You just want to blame white people for everything. But you're not a \textbf{racist}???You then start banging on about NATO and its attack on Libya: I am not sure why. I despise NATO and I would not support any attack on Libya. Once again you make assumptions about what I believe because of my skin colour – because you're not a \textbf{racist} …… or something. You demand that I not bring up the crimes of the Mali empire to cover 'my ancestors barbaric deeds.' Once again you miss the point. My ancestors had no colonies in Africa. But that doesn't seem to matter to you. All that matters to you is the colour of someone's skin. Because you're not a \textbf{racist}………. Or something. 'Then you can tell me why i need to educate my self instead of yourself✌.Africans did NOT ask european envasion.'No: \textbf{Nobody} ever asks for an invasion. But then millions of Africans also did not ask to be conquered and sold into slavery by the Mali kingdoms either. It is very simple really. Colonialism and slavery etc are about power and wealth and greed. They are not, and have never been about skin colour. Secondly if my ancestors did colonise Africa; which they did not; then would that make me somehow guilty by association? My country was also invaded and millions of people killed and enslaved. Should a modern day German kid who was not even born then feel guilty about that? Of course not: Stop being silly: \textbf{Nobody} is responsible for things that happened before they were even born.'They were all fine with their Arts,Culture,Religione and Civilization.So dont bring Mali civilazation to cover up your ancestors barbaric deeds.'No they were not fine. Maybe the ruling elites were fine. But the \textbf{African} kingdoms also built the continent into the world centre of slavery. They were tyrannical, brutal and oppressive in the extreme and most of their victims were Africans. And guess what. You don't have any way to blame that on white people, so you just pretend it never happened. Because you're not a \textbf{racist}??? But it is all about \textbf{race} to you. You make that clear all through your posts. 'The Malians never asked Britishes or french to raped them,killed them or enslaved them'Slavery had been abolished across Europe before the Mali territories were colonised by the British and French. The British and French both forced the abolition of slavery in west Africa wherever they controlled. Once again when you claim that the British and French enslaved the Malians you display a shocking ignorance of history. The Malians were enslaved by other Malians and sold all over Africa, the Middle East and shipped to India and the Americas too, right up to the late 1800s when the French and British began colonising Africa and stamping out slavery. 'All their kings gold which estimated in billions taken to England still person'What? The French took all the Mali King's gold and gave it to the British? Now you're just babbling. That makes no sense at all.'like you here try to defend what the colonial countries shame history.'I do not defend colonialism. You do. I simply say that everybody did it. It was not the preserve of any one \textbf{race}. You suggest that only white people did it. That is because you are either ignorant of history or you are simply \textbf{racist} who wants to blame everything on a \textbf{race} you do not like.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Bela T.T You are not giving historical facts. You are looking at \textbf{African} cultures through rose tinted glasses and ignoring any fact that do not fit your '\textbf{black} man good – white man bad' narrative. That is not how to do history. "What i have said abt mali gold or west \textbf{African} cilization and the consequence of civilzation is all recorded."Recorded where? Citation please! I have been studying and lecturing about this period of history for 15 years. I know of no instance where the French took a Mali King's gold and gave it to the British. The French and British were rivals in Africa. You do know that don't you? I am well aware that European conquerors stole any valuables they could find anywhere they conquered. I also know that \textbf{African} conquerors did the same, so I am not sure what your point is. 'You are trying to play smart by putting abolishment of slavery to justify of colonization.'I am writing this as clearly as possible because you insist once again in misreading what I said. I did not make any attempt to justify colonisation. Colonisation was a crime. I simply pointed out that it was not something that was the preserve of any one \textbf{race}: Africans did it too. I added that while Europeans did indeed to bad things they also did some very good things. I used the abolition of slavery as one example. Don't you agree that that was a European campaign that brought freedom and hope to millions of people, most of them Africans, and do you not agree that it is something that Europeans have the right to be proud of? You do realise that Frenchmen fought against slavery while \textbf{African} kingdoms fought for it. And large numbers of Africans supported those Frenchmen too. 'If that country were left without your countries colonization they would have do the same as Ethiopia did without the help of white man'Well I already told you; my country did not colonise anywhere in Africa; but Really? So now you've got a historical crystal ball. Sorry but it is a fact that when the French arrived in West Africa; the barbaric Mali kingdoms ruled over most of it. Those kingdoms were built on slavery and exploitation of their subject peoples and had been for centuries.The French stole much in the way of resources; but they also abolished slavery, human sacrifice and the caste system. They overthrew the \textbf{African} kings who subjugated the \textbf{African} people. Yet you glorify those brutal \textbf{African} kings and don't seem to care about the \textbf{African} people who were tortured and enslaved by them. It is impossible to say how those territories would have developed had the French not colonised them. But we do know what they were like in 1880, just before the French expansion. They were backward, barbaric and ruled over by bloodthirsty tyrants who cared \textbf{nothing} about the humanity of their own people.You favour the oppressor over the oppressed; except of course when the oppressor happens to be white. 'White man inited themselves their to take what did not belong to them'Yes. So did \textbf{black} men. Everybody did it. That was precisely my point. But you only have a problem with it when white men do it. You make everything about \textbf{race} and that makes you a bigot. 'What would jew person feel if you tell him \textbf{nazi} germany was so great for them?'Well I cannot imagine anyone saying that to a Jew and if someone did say that then that Jewish person would probably think that the person who said that was obviously an idiot and ignorant of history. Kind of like suggesting that the Mali Kingdoms were great for Africans: I think that Jewish man would take the same view as me on the Nazis as well as the \textbf{African} Kingdoms as well as atrocities committed by Europeans. He would probably see murder and torture and slavery as evil; no matter who does it. It is not OK when Africans do it. History is not so \textbf{black} and white. There have been more Europeans killed or enslaved by other Europeans than by Africans. There have been far more Africans killed and enslaved by other Africans than by Europeans.The largest genocides in \textbf{African} history were carried out by Africans; the most recent attempted genocide being in Rwanda. There were no white people involved and when the massacres were eventually stopped; it was by the intervention of Europeans. Should they not have tried to stop it because they were white or because they were not invited or whatever you are trying to say? The Tanzanians also tried to stop it but they lacked the military power. But should they have stayed away because they too are a different \textbf{race}? You are not only chronically ignorant of \textbf{African} history, but you also reduce the concept of \textbf{race} to \textbf{nothing} but skin colour. \textbf{Black} people come from a large range of \textbf{ethnic} groups and cultures. They are not one \textbf{race}. Likewise Europeans: My \textbf{race} is Slavic. We are white. We are a different \textbf{race} from the French, just the same as a person of Bantu origin is not the same \textbf{race} as someone of Swahili origin. It is only racists who think \textbf{race} is all about skin colour. It is only racists who convince themselves that the people of their racial group are blameless and the people with some other skin colour must be blamed for everything. It is only racists who believe that the current generation of some \textbf{race} or other, must atone for the sins of their ancestors, not because they are guilty of anything, but because they have the same skin colour. It is only racists who stereotype entire groups of people based on such superficial things as skin colour; and then demonise them for crimes that happened a century before they were even born. So take a look in the mirror Bella.

This was also a fight against Islam, which like the crusades was a good thing as like this situation the crusades were defensive wars in order to take back European lands conquered by Muslim invaders and not just in Spain, but also the eastern part of Europe where the Muslims made powerful inroads due to Europeans being far too peaceful.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}African & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!27}1/112 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.893 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Chronometer Yes: The history of the crusades has also been re-written to fit in with political correctness – brown man good –white man bad.But the crusades were a response to Islamic expansion into Europe, not the other way around. Much of Spain, Italy and the Balkans had already been conquered by Islam before the first crusade was even a twinkle in Pope Urban's eye. It was a case of European kings finally deciding to put aside their differences and tackle a dangerous enemy that was a threat to all of their kingdoms. Taking the Holy Land back from the Moors was a good motive to appeal to European Christians, but the real purpose was to drive Islam out of Europe, smash the power of Islam in the near east and secure Europe for the building of western civilisation. Europeans have been successfully keeping Islam at bay ever since. Attempts by centuries of Moors, Saracens and Turks have tried to conquer Europe. They all failed. But now Europe is being betrayed by its own quisling classes, personified by traitors like Ankela Merkel and Francois Hollonde. Their predecessors have for generations spilled their own blood to protect Europe from Islam and to preserve the European way of life. Now these traitors throw open the gates and invite Islam in. But the wind of change is bowing through Europe again and it is refreshing. Merkel is the most unpopular German leader of the last forty years. Hollonde is also facing a massive backlash in France with Marine Le Pen topping the polls. They will both be gone next year. The Brits have already made their feelings clear. Poland and Hungary have closed their borders and told the EU to butt out. The Russian president has openly declared that 'Russia is not a 'multicultural society, Russia is a Russian society.' So that \textbf{old} European tradition of protecting the borders and their way of life is being re-born. Despite all the \textbf{limp} wristed 'progressivists' we see on our TV screens, there seems to be plenty of Europeans left who still have a little of the blood of those medieval knights running in their veins. In America too things are looking up. The American people, also the heirs of those medieval knights, have said 'NO' to Hillary Clinton's multicultural, gender-bending, hedonistic, anything goes mindset. They have sent a clear message. 'No we don't hate other people, but this is America. We also have our history and or way of life and we are tired of our own so called leaders telling us we should be ashamed of it. So go ahead and build that wall Mr Trump. Protect your borders. You are not a \textbf{racist}. You are just doing your job, putting your own people first. That is what you are elected to do. Maybe if you get a chance you could visit Europe and point that out to Merkel and co. Europe and North America have built the most successful and most advanced civilisations in human history. They share a rich tradition that reaches back 2500 years. They have given the world Greek Philosophy, French enlightenment, the concept of democracy and human rights, the rule of law, modern medicine, the most magnificent art, literature and architecture; and far too many inventions, discoveries and innovations to mention.If that is not a culture superior to the backward barbaric alternative that Islam offers then I don't know what is.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Limp, Old, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}3/573 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.524 \\  \hline

You were already busy selling your children to each other and to the Arabs. \textbf{Nobody} did slavery more prolifically than the \textbf{African} kingdoms. Europeans of course finally stamped out slavery. No gratitude necessary.As for Africans building Europe: Don't make me laugh. Europeans built Europe long before they went to Africa. If you come from an \textbf{African} country that is one of the world's major gold producers then you come from South Africa. The other top ten gold producers are all outside of Africa.Seems to me South Africa needs a new government. I hate to burst you bubble; but Africans are in charge in that country. If your \textbf{African} government is squandering your country's resources and not using it to create wealth for its own people; then I have a hard time figuring out how you  can blame that on Europeans.And yes Europeans had empires and they had slavery and they did bad stuff; just like everybody else; take it up with the Zulu or the Mali: You don't think Africans did that stuff too. Grow up and stop trying to blame all of your country's problems on ancient history. If you want to come to Europe there is no need to pretend to yourself that Europe owes you anything. It doesn't. You are coming to Europe because it is a more attractive place to live. Be honest with yourself because you are not kidding anyone else. You are lucky to be allowed to come to Europe and to pursue your life in peace. You would not be able to do that in most \textbf{African} countries. Another thing for Europe to be proud of I guess.But if you harbour such hostility to Europe and its people then I suggest you go somewhere else.

European governments do not own the mining equipment. Private companies do. Anyway I am not a South \textbf{African} citizen. Only your government can tell those mining companies what to do. That's kind of how it works; and your government is not European, so blaming its actions on Europeans is a bit stupid to say the least. But if you want your government to tell foreign mining companies to get out of your country; first you should be careful what you wish for. How will the departure of those European companies impact on employment rates and revenue in South Africa? Of course the best thing for South Africans would be to develop their own mining companies and replace the European ones little by little; but like I said; if they don't want to do that, then blaming Europeans is a bit pointless. Large corporations do not operate to make anyone's life better anyway. They operate to make profit. It doesn't matter whether they are European or \textbf{African}. Gazprom is a major Russian company. I am a Russian citizen. Do you think Gazprom cares about me or acts in my interests? I do acknowledge the faults of Europe and they are many. The difference is that I blame them on Europeans, not on other people who have no control over them.

How do we describe others? but hair skin and height. She is really pale or sometimes really white.  Dont take it personally, and also you dont need to mention your \textbf{race} when applying for a job... they ask but you can usually select other or just straight up chose a different one if you'd like(tbh its probably in your benefit to chose \textbf{black} or \textbf{african} american which doesn't make sense anymore). While choosing white is a disadvantage these days depending how competitive the position is.Next if you are speaking of tulsa... hell if there is anyone alive who ordered that or experienced it id be suprised. Just because my irish/scottish ancestors where slaves i dont hate other people who may have had ancestors that had them for it, im just trying to live the one life i was given, and love as much as I can.  All that aside \textbf{race} is a fucking joke... We're all humans last I checked and this made up word \textbf{race} is bullshit.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Midhir Did you know our American gov, has had a \textbf{eugenics} program since the 1900s? In 1990, the U.S. government funded Planned Parenthood went to \textbf{black} schools and told girls they wanted to give them birth control and they sterilized these teen \textbf{black} girls. You know in 1991, the gov. offerered low income housing to \textbf{black} families that had high levels of lead in order to study the effects of high lead levels in the body? Did you also know that \textbf{black} communities in the U.S. are more likely to be poisoined. They switched over a good water supply to dirty water with \textbf{old} pipes with high lead levels without treating the water and tons of people got sick. The  children in Flint are now mentally retarded because  lead is a brain toxin and causes violent behavior. You know the 13th Amendment in the U.S. says slavery is abolished except as punishment for a crime? So after 1865, the prison population went from 90 white to 90 \textbf{black}. The government created \textbf{Black} Codes that were only for \textbf{black} people where they would arrest blacks for not having a job, being homeless, leaving their wife or husband, spitting, not being skilled for a job or not having an id card. Railroad companies and coal companies paid prisons to get them workers so prisons had a need to keep them full in order for them to get paid. Although, convict leasing slowed down in 1931 due to the need for soldiers for World War II it still exist today. Big companies pay industrial prisons to keep prisons full, Whole Foods is one of them. \textbf{Black} people on crack were given the harshes sentences but whites on cocaine were given more lenient sentences and treatment. Crack is cheaper so more blacks could afford it and crack was put in \textbf{black} communities by our very gov. to fund the War in Nicaragua. It's funny how you can tell a people who are constantly targeted due to our \textbf{race} and \textbf{ethnicity} not to see \textbf{race} or \textbf{racism}, when we are the most affected by it. Blacks whose families have been in the U.S. for 300 years have experienced never ending \textbf{racism} but somehow we should ignore it? We are harassed by the police at random remember the Stop and Frisk law which said that the police could just pat down a random \textbf{black} male on the street? The 3 Strikes law which also affected \textbf{black} men heavily. Now there is a law where they can search your car and house if they want without a warrant and if you protest you go to jail. America is \textbf{nothing} but \textbf{racism}. You know the U.S. news oversaturates the news with \textbf{black} crime so that white citizens believe that they are justified to abuse our rights because they believe all blacks are criminals? Everyday white Americans go around calling the police on \textbf{black} people for just being in their neighborhood, taking pics in a park, selling lemonade, being in their own college library.

So if we have Native American blood mixed, born in this country, that make us part American right? Don't give me a bull shit side answer, be fucking direct. On average most of us in the states are part European, mostly \textbf{African}, if I'm correct, our \textbf{African} blood falls between 60-90, those on the 60 side, usually are the people who come out with different features, or \textbf{African} features but lighter skin,  different eye, or hair color. I know my history, I wish slavery didn't happen but it did. I can't deny that.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I don't think we're \textbf{racist} in France (might be a few, but what can we do ?). We believe in integration, meaning that the people coming to live here will be French and slowly merge into our culture and society (while if they want remaining aware of where they're from, and proud if they want to).There is maybe a limit to that : French don't like people that are French on paper, live in France, are born in France but don't feel French. That's the signal that integration didn't work. It's not \textbf{racism}... It's us seeing that integration didn't work.That's also why some Muslims cause issues : they don't want to share our culture and our ideas. A society can only survive if its people share the same interests and ideas (guess why the Roman Empire fell?).France is not like the USA  : we don't want to have minorities all over the place, living among themselves. Sadly it happens, because we underestimate the difficulties it is for people to integrate. Turns out education in school is not enough, and especially in banlieues people don't see a lot of French (feeling French) so they can't integrate. The more the reject French cultures and ideas and the more they'll have a hard time with French I guess. It's a complicated issue here, because we want people to feel French while they don't want to integrate (some even start to hate France). Like I said : complex, different from the USA : welcome to Europe.(and now you understand why Germany will have difficulties if they bring 1M Syrians in their country).I'll even say this : far right in France is not \textbf{racist}. They just want the French culture not to take anything from other cultures, and they want all the people in France to be as French as possible. There is no \textbf{racism}. But they are too stringent on their definition of French, and are home to a lot of racists.If you think about culture and not "\textbf{race}" (fuck I don't like to use this word because it make no sense, THERE IS NO \textbf{RACE}, WAKE UP AMERICA) you'll understand why did you see a \textbf{black} \textbf{woman} from the USA that does not share the Afro-American culture.

(hello, excuse me, do you speak english ?) before starting the conversation.

It's not a fair attitude for others you judge too quickly (and believe me, you can't deeply understand a country in a few days asking people on the capital).

He is saying: "The change is now"Of course, it's kind of cynical. Historically speaking, Europeans thought of tribal Africans as savages, lesser humans, and treated them as children. That's probably why they decided to use a man who is dressed like that. Maybe there's this idea that Obama isn't suited for the task.

While this type of thing only happens in suburbs (the us ghetto equivalent here) and is more link to poverty in those areas than a question of \textbf{race}.The other part, the open one, is made up of a younger generation which had grew up and went to school with them (diversity in school exists in france because the private school system is so underdeveloped). They know they are not criminal in the making and accept them.Back in high school I remember a girl my \textbf{age} who was in love with a \textbf{black} guy and was afraid to introduce him to her parents because they were \textbf{racist}.

Are you seriously trying to sit here and tell me that slavery did not happen to \textbf{black} people  and that it was \textbf{black} people that took whites from their home? lol wow.. Many Africans were misled and deceived into thinking they were going to go to a better place. What about the ones that we're not sold into slavery by other africans? are you just forgetting about them, or are you just not mentioning them because it makes your argument sound better? while true, SOME africans sold themselves into slavery, the africans that were sold by other africans were the prisoners of the tribes. They only sold the people that they had captured from other tribes from wars they fought amongst themselves. And the criminals. That would clearly not have been enough for millions of the slaves that were transported, so you know what happened? The Europeans came back and stole people and killed whomever got in their way. Once you think about it, if you were the chief of a tribe, and someone wanted to take your people away from their home, would you send yourself, and the rest of the good tribal members, or the prisoners that no one wanted to associate with? Because as I said before, it wasn't like white people nicely asked them to get into slavery, they had guns. Where did you get "only 3 owned slaves in the USA"? That's not true, also of white Americans back then owned \textbf{black} people. There were a lot  of slaves and \textbf{black} people had no rights. But it's funny how you say "Only 3 went to the USA" and "Only 3 owned slaves in the USA " caught you in a lie! If only 3 then where did all of these \textbf{African} Americans come from? The families of most \textbf{African} Americans today have been living in the U.S for years and do you see how they don't know where they descend from in Africa?

I wonder why I was asked by several \textbf{black} teens to help them with their stuck truck in the woods yesterday. Why they tried to drive their truck there is a wonder but \textbf{crazy} teens. No blacks are good and many are my good friends. Lol you say about slavery? are you so ignorant? I never said slavery did not happen; it was in every \textbf{race}. Wait let me re read. Nope I never said that so I guess comprehension is your problem to twist things to fit your agenda.  Many mis lead to go to a better place? By blacks if any. I suppose after some 200 years and seeing blacks raid the villages and chaining people and raping others to the ports to be sold just never occurred that it was not a nice place. Are you serious? Not hardly could they had been so ignorant. Wow, lol? you truly are selective in your research but then a very creative people but logic and reasoning not. I suppose you have knowledge that only blacks were enslaved and NEVER whites. Slavery only in the America's right? Slavery continues today and legally in parts of Africa child. I fought on the dark continent freeing blacks oppressed by blacks in ways your small mind could not dream. Yes, we freed them in Angola. Why do you skip in your replies? Only criminals and they whites with guns who never left the ports took them to they were deceived to thinking they were going to a better place? Get your story straight as you sound so wishy washy. No whites left to find free blacks from the ports. Blacks brought plenty to SELL. Slavery was the way of the times. Was it good? Of course not but you were blessed by it. The whites, or Moors delt in slvery. A slave in the USA was worth more than a new car today. Yes only 3 to include \textbf{black} owners had slaves in the USA and slavery was outlawed within 80 years. 97 did not own them . You said for me to do my research before speaking? Hey you should try as it is an easy look up. America for the most treated them well as far as slaves were treated. Did horrible things happen? Yes they did but to burn a new car was not the normal. After the Civil War was the horrible and it certainly was I agree. Blacks did have their choice to return to Africa and few did as most saw it a death sentence. Those that did to Liberia started plantations and slaves to work their farms. Whites had guns again ? They did not need guns fool as the slaves were brought to them chained and bound by other blacks! Whites did not go into the jungles for free blacks. Blacks did it for profit. I guess you are \textbf{blind} to the truth that your ancestors were sold by their own. I would be bothered by it as well.. Caught me in a lie about the 3 to the USA? No, caught you in ignorance you are too proud to research. 95 went to the Caribbean and most to Brazil. Must I repeat myself another time. I did not make it up fool. You lol? Only makes you the joke. The USA went to war to free slaves and that is a fact which many whites died. NO slaves would had escaped without white help. Try ancestry.com if your lost. It is sad about the past but no tears for the many whites enslaved by blacks? Blacks raided the European coast for some hundreds of years enslaved \textbf{woman} and boys for \textbf{sex} and men to the galley or certain death. Please read the facts and research as you truly sound so ignorant. They were criminals! No they were fooled to believe! No, white man went into the jungles to capture them! No! Research you say? I have done more research in my life that you , your children and your parents combined have done. I have also traveled six continents as a soldier, mercenary, tourist.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@abrey lewi OK I read your article. Maybe wars did make slaves but what were those wars about? Blacks in Africa or whites in Europe made wars for gain to which they so profit. The \textbf{black} tribes preyed on others to profit for their sale and material gains. Yes your \textbf{black} brothers sold blacks as the \textbf{black} pimps sell \textbf{woman} on the streets to made profit. Most are not so horrible but it does not take a majority to make a horror. Slavery was a huge profit all the way to where they were going. I noticed the writer is from Ghana. Do your research and type in where does slavery exist. Slaves was not new to Africa and it still thrives. Of the 3 races it has be outlawed only in whites which were also the last to embrace it. Blacks had used slavery power and pleasure from the start and to the present. Sometimes they cover it with the term "indentured service" , Sudan and several west coast \textbf{African} nations still embrace it. The USA was the second to outlaw it in the west after Canada which my Family is from and where many blacks sought haven. My heritage had \textbf{nothing} to do with slavery at any time but so what as it happened. Try with your efforts to blame whites for the suffering of which you never suffered and neither did your generations six times before you yet you cry as if you did!! Maybe put your BS to blame whites for something that ended 150 years by a 3 which counts the first slave owner in the USA who was a \textbf{black} man!! Try looking at the slavery in the home of your ancestors that continues today. When did you go to a Civil War Memorial to thank the thousands of whites that sacrificed their lives for the freedom of men? If you look around do you see anyone that can claim a slave owners heritage? Certainly not me! My family first saw a \textbf{black} in the 1930's.

You know you are the one in denial and you should  stop being in denial about it. Your people first started slavery with the natives and when they saw that they were  dying because they were not strong enough, they decided to go kidnap Africans in Africa to enslaved them. The Natives and Africans nations were fonctionning very well, they had a gouverment, their society was well structured and everything, but you came and destroyed all of it because you think that you are the ones who should rule the world. This is how white people are. Couch potatoes and lazy asses who are always taking advantange of other people to do their dirty job and then have the nerve to claim out loud that they own and build everything.They caused all the pain, the suffering,  the trouble and  damages in this world and then blame the victims for a situation they put them in. The whole world is upside down because of you. You have to learn to hear these things more often so you can internize it to finally blame yourself for it. You have ripped us of everthing that we once were in Africa; our languanges, or \textbf{african} names, our culture, our heritage.  You have distroyed our identity in order to control us better because when you don't know who you are, you are not in position to revendicate. You have raped us (men, women and children), sell us to other slave owners which lead to the separation of families living on the plantations, whiped us and then put salt or hot pepper (carribean) in our wounds, tie slaves women to  trees and wipped them and then put salt or hot pepper in their wounds, cut our foot when we tried to escape, beat us naked flat on the floor, almost starve us to death and then expect us to be strong enough to go pick up cotton or sugar canes in the fields, give us food in a animal feeder because you considered us as animals but treated them better than us, .....the list is very long I swear,  but I am going to stop there. And then, when the slavery has been abolished, you have started to hang \textbf{black} men who are the head of the family to trees, you created segregation, prevent \textbf{black} people to have rights that any white citizen would have, make laws that are not in our favor as subventionning schools that are in the suburbs, wrongly arresting, killing and emprisoning \textbf{black} people and so on..the list is very long. In short, you hate the \textbf{black} free man and \textbf{woman} and since the slavery has been abolished you have done everything that was in your power in order to opress them and preventing them to evolve as as society. You did everything to keep us at the hacker social ladder. It is a war of power, because if you give \textbf{black} people too much power, they might be in control of a white dominant society and this you don't want it to happen. Now that we are free, we  have became a threat for you.  If one day \textbf{black} people find themselves as the ones in control of your society, you know that the US might become like another South Africa. And educated person like you should understand that and this is making you sweating bullets. The truth shall set us free and that is the reason why you are becoming so aggresive , outraged and enraged when you see that we are educating oursleves about our history . When you know your history you know who you are and when you know who you are you are aware of your identity and this awarness lead us to be in position where we can revendicate our rights. It is okay to remember the shoa, but it is not to remember the 400 years of slavery that your people have put us through.

That should be easy to do.You are listening to trash and false thoughts.  Africa has more slaves than the world combined today. Slavery was less than 80 years in the USA and less than 2 owned slaves. The average slave in the US was valued more than a new car today and you think they were hanging them? Free blacks in the USA; 1 in 4 owned a slave. the first slaves in the Americas were whites and the first \textbf{black} slave owners were blacks. The freed blacks that returned to Africa started slave worked farms. Most whites did not want slavery and the war to free them cost some 800,000 white lives. It reversed and blacks were the owners do you thing they would had do the same? NO!! 400 years of slavery my people put you through Are you so stupid . First again slavery lasted 77 years in the USA and not 400! Hell not so smart as you are the USA is only231 years \textbf{old} now so how did we have slavery 400 years? My people? My people actually saw their first \textbf{black} in the 1930's and slavery was long over. I think you will be a lonely person if you think they will attack and rape the white suburbs.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Baybeeka16 First I do not use google translation and if this is your idea of trying to up yourself then sorry it is not. Acadian or Quebec French is the 17 th century French before the slang and butchery of the language but then you being \textbf{African} immigration would not know that. To be honest I was not aware google did a translation; interesting. I already told you (Of course your comprehension is weak so I understand) , my family did not see their first \textbf{black} till the 30's. They are from Northern New Brunswick and East Quebec. No blacks there! The Duguay came to Canada in 1590 and Le Blanc in 1618 as explorers of France. I would not expect you would had heard of Rene Duguay from St Milo and one of France's great Admirals. My other side is to Field Marshal Rene Ney as in the "Bravest of the Brave",  to Napoleon. No I am not French American but first born USA. I see facts upset you. I understand as if my roots were from Africa I would had left as well. As said reguardless I seriously doubt your blood is French except by transport. \textbf{Black} jealousy and so sad . It would be good if blacks would stop blaming whites for their social problems and start taking responsibility for their own actions. I noticed you still cannot answer the questions; it is okay as to do so would admit fault as so I understand. A population that outnumbers whites 4 to 1 and still brought blacks of their own to sell. A \textbf{race} that ruled the world! A \textbf{race} without ships and ports but ruled the world and still could not rescue the blacks they sold. Too funny. I am older than you for sure child and I still remember the Boko Harem killing their own and raping them and even ate some. When they saw us moving in they ran as we killed many and the saved people loved us for it. Wonderful folks the Boko Harem were!! I cannot laugh at it as it was a horror beyond dreams the way they slaughtered children and innocent people. I suppose you should had moved to the Congo or Angola or maybe Uganda to speak to them!!

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Saving/me If he's from the USA, and \textbf{Black}, then he might very well have been treated better in France than in his own country. A number of \textbf{Black} Americans (including an older relative of mine who fought at Normandy) have testified to this over many decades. I try to point out to fellow \textbf{Black} Americans that the situation might be different if they were North Africans, or even francophone Blacks from Mali or the Antilles.       Once on my return from France in the lat 1980s I tried to publish an article on the situation of peoples of color in France with a \textbf{Black} American women's magazine known as ESSENCE. They rejected that article and (I later learned) a similar article by a \textbf{Black} American. But then they published another article talking about how grand life in France was for \textbf{Black} people. But I noticed that all those prosperous \textbf{Black} people interviewed who found life so rewarding in France were \textbf{Black} Americans. This prompted me and another brother I'd met over there to pen now angry letters to ESSENCE to set the record straight (as best we could considering we weren't French people of color), and to criticize the magazine for failing in its responsibilities.   I had been reading up on SOS, the National Front, the situation of North Africans and blacks beforehand. And while in France I took some time to talk to Francophone Blacks and North Africans, as well as talking to SOS people, and at least one philosopher connected at that time with LES TEMPS MODERNES. I also visited and spoke with persons connected with PRESENCE AFRICAINES.     So while I was not (and am not) an expert on these matters, I took some effort to try to inform myself rather than simply drawing conclusions based on my personal "experience" as some naively do.  One thing that stuck in my memory was that Francophone Blacks and Arabs seems to react to French police (and police to them) which was eerily like what I've seen here in the USA.    But as for my own experiences in France they were quite benign. Hell, I enjoyed myself! I did feel like the weight of \textbf{race} was off my shoulders in ways unimaginable in the USA. I could see why an older relative who had fought at Normandy said he was tempted to stay in France and never return to \textbf{Jim C\textbf{row}} America. Except for Frenchmen who dislike Americans, they were generally friendly. I can see how a \textbf{Black} American can get an overly benign picture of France.  No, France does have its problems with \textbf{racism}.  And from what I hear about the popularity of the National Front it could be worse than many imagine. But I've no evidence that France is WORST than others. In both France and the USA, the question is whether the democratic ideals of our two societies will prevail over \textbf{racism}, or whether we shall enter into an era of fascistic oppression, barbarism and misery.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Crow, Jim Crow, Race, Racism & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}14/497 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.817 \\  \hline

If SOS is no longer active, I wonder why. They certainly made their presence felt when I used to visit your country in the 1980s.   By the way, the health care and education system you do have in France and in much of Europe is one thing we do not have here.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small African American is a term that is so often misused. It's a cultural moniker which has little connection to the people it so often describes. White Americans can accurately be called European-Americans because they are cultural descendants of European culture. Even then it's not \textbf{common}. As for the majority of \textbf{Black} people particularly the decedents of Slave their \textbf{African} culture was utterly destroyed and they are far more European than they are \textbf{African}. I would also agree with the Nigerian \textbf{woman} when she said "does it make it any better when a \textbf{Black} person says it?"

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Tai CooleyYou are incorrect when you state that white Americans do not obsess over skin color. Skin color and \textbf{race} are very salient in the U.S., because more often than not, skin color determines one's overall social status/standing.I also think your view of \textbf{black} Americans is very limited. There's certainly a sizable number of low income blacks in the U.S., but most \textbf{black} Americans are either working class or middle class (like most Americans in general).If you want to know more about \textbf{black} upper income Americans --read Lawrence Otis Graham's best selling book entitled "Our Kind of People."---------"Debutante cotillions, Million-dollar homes, Summers in Martha's Vineyard. Membership in the Links, Jack \& Jill, Deltas, Boule, and AKAs. An obsession with the right schools, families, social clubs, and skin complexion. This is the world of the \textbf{black} American upper class and the focus of the first book written about the \textbf{black} elite by a member of this hard-to-penetrate group.Author and TV commentator Lawrence Otis Graham, one of the nation's most prominent spokesmen on \textbf{race} and class, spent six years interviewing the wealthiest \textbf{black} families in America. He includes historical photos of a people that made their first millions in the 1870s. Graham tells who's in and who's not in the group today with separate chapters on the elite in New York, Los Angeles, Washington, Chicago, Detroit, Memphis, Atlanta, Philadelphia, Nashville, and New Orleans."------Honestly, this will give you the best glimpse into how the \textbf{black} aristocracy in the U.S. think.  In truth, the majority of \textbf{black} Americans who are upper income routinely point out that \textbf{black} Americans are mixed and not merely of \textbf{African} ancestry. My family is definitely a mixture of all races, like many \textbf{black} American families; therefore, I agree that it is a complete misnomer to label \textbf{black} Americans "\textbf{African}."\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African, Black, Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}15/308 & \cellcolor{green!5}4.87 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Summer Sunshine I never thought that there weren't any middle class \textbf{black} Americans. I know that \textbf{black} Americans have the highest GDP compared to other blacks around the world. I do know that \textbf{black} Americans are far behind in the economic pool than other races are in America too though. Asian immigrants have surpassed \textbf{black} Americans in only recent years when they started emigrating there and some others. Whites do not obsess over skin colour like \textbf{black} Americans do. They never once brought up \textbf{race} with me when I visited. It was many \textbf{black} Americans who brought up racial topics with me when I sparked conversation with some. I have a strong accent and they ask where I am from so I tell them East Africa but live in France. So they automatically ask how do the whites treat me here. I thought to myself "why would you ask me that? You can be asking me so many other or important questions." \textbf{Black} Americans are definitely colour struck too. I'm not light skinned as you can see but my hair is pretty fine textured. They ask me if I am mixed \textbf{race} and which parent is white and \textbf{black}. I laughed and said I am not mixed \textbf{race}. I'm originally from Mauritius.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Tai Cooley That's interesting since there were middle class \textbf{Black} Americans even in the 1700s \& 1800s. However the \textbf{black} middle classes at least doubled or tripled since the 1960s. But I wonder where you are from if you didn't know that there were middle class \textbf{Black} Americans. Even as  a \textbf{black} American schoolboy I knew there were middle class blacks in the West Indies and Africa. I sometimes read West \textbf{Indian} and \textbf{African} thinkers like CLR James, George Padmore, Eric Williams, Kwame Nkrumah, Amilcar Cabral, Camara Laye, Frantz Fanon, Chinua Achebe, Nelson Mandela and others. In short, I wanted to KNOW and to understand. Hence I inquired, and developed numerous friends among Africans and Caribbean people living in the USA. I can only be curious as to why you're not familiar with some of our thinkers and writers; persons like W.E.B. Du Bois, Anna Julia Cooper, Alain Locke, Richard Wright, Joy James, James Baldwin, Paul Robeson, Langston Hughes, Angela Y. Davis, Michelle Alexander, Manning Marable,  bell hooks, Cornel West and others I could suggest. For if you were so informed it would have been hard for you to have been unaware of the existence of an American \textbf{Black} middle class. And you'd probably also know how racial caste in America works such that "whiteness" is hegemonic; so much so that in the USA whiteness is taken (prereflectively) as being virtually the norm of all that is right, good, beautiful and even human. Those who are identified with the norm often don't speak it,but rather simply assume it without even thinking about it. Those not identified with the norm, or even deemed the opposite of the norm do not have that privilege.    Most American \textbf{black} people know (or at least sense) that they are the anti-thesis of the norm (even though some of us try even today to assimilate to it).  This is largely why the struggle for \textbf{black} empowerment and liberation in America has been for more than just certain economic improvements, but rather has been from the very beginning a struggle for our humanity.  I don't expect you to understand this from day one.  But if you choose to speak on it, it would be well if you took some time and effort to inquire and seek to understand.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African, Black, Indian & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - Native-American & \cellcolor{green!5}9/381 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.362 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@SagesseNoir I think it's actually fairly easy for \textbf{African} immigrants to assume that most \textbf{black} Americans are poor, because more often than not, \textbf{African} immigrants are not wealthy, and are therefore relegated to the worst communities in America, upon arriving. This means that much of their early socialization is with the \textbf{black} underclass. Very rarely would an \textbf{African} \textbf{immigrant} move to rural parts of America (therefore, they are not really exposed to the white underclass). And those without money are certainly not exposed to the \textbf{black} middle class, because it takes money to afford to purchase a home in a good/middle class community.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}African, Black, Immigrant & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}7/103 & \cellcolor{green!27}6.796 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Summer Sunshine If Africans come here as \textbf{common} laborers, then they may be exposed mainly to the \textbf{Black} poor. However, many come here as students; and regardless of whether they attend an HBCU or a predominantly white university, they're bound to meet middle class \textbf{African} Americans. Also, come Africans are so ensconced in white communities as to have little contact with American Blacks.   But if there are American Blacks in those almost lily white communities they are probably middle class people themselves. The Africans who attended this private mostly white university in which I did graduate work would have met mostly whites, but the blacks whom they et were nearly completely middle class. Those who attended my HBCU undergraduate school would have met a mixture of middle class and poorer American Blacks. (Needless to say, al their professors would be middle class people). A lot does depend on where you live, work and go to school. But I do recall that while growing up in the inner city of Baltimore I rarely met Africans. I began to meet significant numbers of Africans only once I was at the university, an institution which is  geared toward studies which help to either maintain one's middle class status if you have it, or if you don't (as in my case) to enable you to attain the middle class condition. While I don't have scientific data on this as of yet, it appears to me that in America, unlike Europe where so many Africans live as \textbf{common} laborers, Africans tend to come with at least a modicum to middle class background when they arrive in the USA.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African, Black, Common & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}4/273 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.465 \\  \hline

Why dont \textbf{black} people live in africa anyway?Most of the \textbf{black} population live in africa but there are many factors why some are in europe, here are a few-They were FORCED out of their country many years ago againts their will and they have finally settled in europe.-Because now everybody has the right to migrate for whatever reason they want to wherever.2. Why should they be all over the whites countries in the world?-Look at the answer in question one coz it basically answers it too.-whites were the one who forced them out and brought them to their own countries.-And dont flatter yourself they not only go to white countries but to any country they want to be because as i have said everybody has the right to migrate.(When you replied to my first comment you asked)3. tell me the reason why blacks have to mix into white countries and act like they are historically one of them calling themselves german, english, french?-Once again the answer in question one pretty much answers this.Extra explanation:The original "mixing" happened when they were forced out of their country brought to yours and married to the whites, now their children are biracial. what determines what \textbf{race} they will be in 1. Where they are born2. Where they live for the rest of their life.If their child lives in france and adopts everything french plus the fact that he is half french then he is a frenchman, \textbf{nothing} in him is \textbf{black} except his physical appearance, this applies even to those who are not biracial but was born and raised in france.I hope i have answered it now.

Not all \textbf{African} people are poor but many are. It is well known for a fact that Africa is the poorest continent of the world. Actually, most diseases in Africa are those that can be prevented for less than \$5 vaccine or with drugs that sell for less than \$10.Sexually Transmitted Diseases are a very big cause of death in Africa. With no proper \textbf{sexual} education of responsible \textbf{sexual} behavior and general access to condoms the \textbf{African} are plagued by them.

Et encore, loger et nourrir les travailleurs s'est avéré, au XIXe siècle, plus cher que de leur payer un salaire de misère, comme c'était le cas dans le secteur industriel. Ce facteur pris en compte, la force de travail des esclaves n'a rien de gratuit… Sinon historiquement ce que tu dis est vrai, même si ça ne veut pas dire que les Wasps n'ont pas de dette envers les Noirs Américains descendants d'esclaves)…My comment was just highlighting the double meaning of the English word "free", which made your sentence particularly awkward, not to say awful. In English, free means "obtainable without any payment" but also "not imprisoned or enslaved." This workforce may have been free, but slaves could be everything but free. Also note that providing slaves with dwelling and food eventually became more expensive than just paying them a ridiculous salary, like industrial employers did at the time. Given this, the workforce was not economically free… Otherwise what you say is historically accurate, even if it does not mean that Wasp American have no debt to \textbf{African} American slave descendants…\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}African & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!27}1/221 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.452 \\  \hline

The party was used to fraction the right wing electorate, and it worked, the left won the election during this time. This party had a clear \textbf{racist} ideology and used to be a mere political business for a family and its acolytes to sell pants and hatcheries to a very \textbf{dumb} crowd (less than 0.5 of vote for a very long time).Their speech always ran on demagogic ideas like anti-immigration. Now that our fourth republic is weaken, and that the European project is making angry people (change always make people angry) they adapt their speech with anti-european, anti-globalization speech. they try to hide their \textbf{racist} roots but \textbf{nobody} gets fool.A lot of people voted for them during the last election not because they are \textbf{racist} but in sign of protestation against the main right wings and left wing parties.At the core they are not Nazis, but you can find some Nazis in it. \textbf{Nobody} in France could walk 1 meter showing a \textbf{nazi} cross, those people are very few but we cannot ignore them.

I PERSONALLY SAW police harassing North Africans and Blacks while there. Now I think the young \textbf{Black} American ought to be less comic in his approach, more "professional" in his inquiries regarding French \textbf{racism}. But to dismiss his inquiries as stupid would be itself a stupid dismissal. Have you guys even heard about the NATIONAL FRONT and their record of \textbf{racist} violence? This is REAL. And what has the speaker's light complexion has to do with this? Would it make any difference if he were the complexion of Michelle Obama?\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}7/181 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.867 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@MSMikado8 That has been an issue in my country (USA) since the time of slavery. The light skin/dark skin divide was actually created by the white slaveholders, and continued for at least a century after slavery by certain practices of discrimination. My mother, a light skinned \textbf{woman} from the \textbf{Jim C\textbf{row}} South, noted even after moving North that often the few "better" jobs available to Blacks were often advertised specifically for LIGHT SKINNED "\textbf{colored}" person ("\textbf{colored}" and "\textbf{Negro}" being more \textbf{common} names for American blacks in the 1950s \& early 60s). In a book called the COLOR COMPLEX, it was noticed that given the small privileges afforded to lighter skinned American Blacks it was generally the case that most better educated and well off \textbf{Black} were light skinned. That is less true today than decades ago, but has not completely  disappeared. What's harmful to Blacks is the extent to which Blacks--light , dark and in-between--have internalized the psychology of this "colorism" (as it's sometimes called in the USA). It is emotionally harmful even if it doesn't divide politically the American \textbf{Black} population as it has the South \textbf{African} Blacks from the "coloreds". Basically, the light skin/dark skinned divide--whereby value and beauty are increased the closer one is to white, and diminished the further one is from whiteness (or closer to blackness)--is really an internalization within the \textbf{Black} psyche of white \textbf{racism} and Eurocentric aesthetics and values. This sickness was diminished but not ended by the \textbf{Black} consciousness movement during the 1960s in the USA.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}African, Black, Colored, Common, Crow, Jim Crow, Negro, Racism, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}13/254 & \cellcolor{green!27}5.118 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Peacewithchildren What I'm talking about may be more \textbf{common} among Francophone Blacks from the West Indies. The experience of Blacks from Martinique, to take one example, is in a sense similar to that of Blacks of the USA. They, like we, are descendants of Africans deported during the slave trade. And what we sometimes call "colorism" in the USA, began in the French Caribbean (like in the USA) during slavery. That divide was imposed by the whites. However, while the French (at least after slavery) offered the carrot of assimilation, in the USA segregation was the standard policy--and remains a FACT (no longer the law) even today in the USA. Colorism may have been intensified in the French territories because the ideology of assimilation promised you could gain equality, escape racial inferiority by assimilating French values, language, etc. In short, by becoming white. The mentally colonized \textbf{Black} American often also wanted to be assimilated, to become white, but was made to know in no uncertain terms that he was not welcome--not even with a Harvard U Ph.D. and mastery of the King's English and a dozen other European languages.  Largely for this reason a \textbf{Black} person as "color struck" as martiniique's Mayotte Capecia (as is evident in her work "Je suis Martiniquaise) would be unusual in the USA. The very bluntness of American \textbf{racism} compared to a more nuanced and subtle French \textbf{racism} would likely jolt an American \textbf{Black} back into consciousness. Perhaps that's why our Harlem Renaissance preceded  Francophone Negritude.     In Africa, I'm not as sure. French colonialism did seduce Africans with the policy and ideology of assimilationism, But unlike both the Martiniquais and Les Americains Noires, the \textbf{African} is not uprooted from his/her land and culture. \textbf{Mental} colonialism (of which colorism is one feature) may not be as deeply rooted in as many people as in the French Caribbean. But I'm pretty sure that it existed because I've read \textbf{African} writers who talk about it. But it may have affected mainly the \textbf{African} elites, and less so the masses. And the condition may not run as deep.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African, Black, Common, Mental, Racism & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}10/349 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.865 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@SagesseNoir You're right this set of mind is more \textbf{common} for people from the West Indies. Even the way you presented Assimilationism is kind of the Caribbean caricatural/simplified version. In France we don't really have this light skin VS dark skin thing you have in English countries, only Caribbean think like this in my own experience. Some Congolese and Senegalese do light skinning tho but they generally grew up in Africa and are uneducated. I also think your vision of France is too politicized and too cliché, like the fact to see \textbf{racism} everywhere. Don't forget that the late 80's were very unique and kind of shitty for immigrants because of the political context (Mass immigration and massive regularization of illegals, one of the first to happen in Europe). Your \textbf{Black} French friends don't represent all \textbf{Black} French, and don't forget also that culturally we complain much more in France than in other Western countries. Even when things are good we'll find a critic or some negativity…Finally, the Front National is not as \textbf{racist} as you think it is. It's first a nationalist party, anti immigration and anti Islam. They don't have a racialist speech like some Neo \textbf{Nazi} further East… It's politically one of the softest far right party in Europe, and it's much less extreme than many of your Republicans, I don't even mention the Tea Party.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Jocelyne Alexandra I must admit that my own impressions may be dated because I've not been back to France Since the 1990s. I enjoyed my stay there. But I was concerned when I heard Blacks and North Africans complaining about \textbf{racism}. In the 1980s when I was a student, Blacks here in the States had become aroused by the fight against apartheid in South Africa, and then word had gotten back to some of us about the National Front. Some \textbf{Black} American newspapers and magazines asked me to inquire to see what I might find. I must admit that I felt the burden of \textbf{race} far less in France than in the USA.  And I had \textbf{elder} relatives who fought in WWII, one at Normandy, and who thought that France was almost paradise compared to our KKK-ridden and segregation bound society. (Richard Wright once said that there was more freedom in one block of Paris than in the whole of the USA).  But talking to Tunisians, Malians, Martiniquais and others gave me a different and more sobering picture. I couldn't help noticing that many white French who were friendly to me were quite unfriendly and even hostile to francophone Blacks. Yet I didn't see the marks of segregation so commonplace in the USA that we Americans have ceased noticing it here. I also saw a degree of social mingling between Blacks and whites in Paris that exceeded even what one would find at that time in the largest and most liberal of American cities. And then there was the anti-racist group called SOS and their inscriptions "touche pas mon copain." That, at least, was encouraging.  As I was telling a friend recently visiting from Paris "At least your country doesn't have an INGRAINED tradition of racial caste and segregation that we have in the USA, and which even the Movements of the 1960s couldn't fully dislodge.

Besides, like the \textbf{African} guy said at the beginning , he feels more French than \textbf{African} because when he goes to Africa, he is not consider as a REAL \textbf{African} , cause the way he acts and speaks is different. The big issue in France is the way they deal with the \textbf{racism}, we don't talk about it. People ignore it and pretend it does not exist (like some white French said in the video)But the fact is that France has a difficult story with Africa because they colonized most of the countries in Africa. If you go to Africa , most of the people speak French and there's also a lot of French there, that's why France cannot say anything about the \textbf{black} population in France. besides, I iust wanna remind you that there is some French territories in the Caribbean and those people are French even though they are \textbf{black}.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}African, Black, Racism & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}8/178 & \cellcolor{green!27}4.494 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small In other words... while we can point the finger at the French for reinstituting chattel slavery, the Americans and the British both under the guise of "abolishment" carried out and continued just as sinister a form of anti-black, \textbf{racist}, capitalist enslavement right along with France.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The abolishing of slavery was never out of humane concern, my friend.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Man, I love "StereoTypes" but I really appreciated this episode because I've read about the racial climate in France (via years of French classes and hijab scandals and whatnot) and Europe in general. I visited London two years ago with a class that studied multiculturalism and surveyed the racial history of England, and it made me even more curious as to what life as an \textbf{African}-American or \textbf{African} must be like across the pond. The questions you asked were ON POINT, Ryan!

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small except... that's just people's \textbf{race}? solely referring to people's colour is not a insult but a form of acceptance, terms need to exist if the issue is to be addressed. what he was doing was highlighting an important problem, and acting like \textbf{race} doesn't exist nulls over the existence of racial discrimination.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/52 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.846 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small "White" is a social category used in America that has given people of European descent benefits and special privileges above all others; especially "Blacks" (any group of people of \textbf{African} descent)We can't forget this history and stop calling Europeans "Whites" simply b/c the rest of the world does not adhere to this system. It would completely ignore the social ills that we currently have due to 400+ years of building "Whites" up and tearing "Blacks" down and leaving everyone else in-between\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}African & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!27}1/82 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.22 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I'm not understanding how he is supposed to ask about \textbf{race} relations in France without using those words. He came SPECIFICALLY to ask about what it is like to be a \textbf{black} person in France. People just hate to not beat around the bush about \textbf{race} lately. It's like as soon as you say "white" or "\textbf{black}" people \textbf{freak} out and don't want to hear it which is why \textbf{nothing} ever changes.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Well as a Finnish person I would say people look at these things very different. In Europe the issue is more about culture than \textbf{ethnicity}. I would say people in Europe see people as part of smaller groups than in US. People are not "\textbf{black}" or "white", but part of some national group. "White" as a racial term is used mainly in UK. When I explain my \textbf{ethnic} background, I say Im Finnish or North-European.
