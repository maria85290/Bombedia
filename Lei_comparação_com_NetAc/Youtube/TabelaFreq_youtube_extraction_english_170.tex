  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Here so Simon Huck and Jonathan Cheban can be the P.R. Guys for Justin Massler/Jesus Christ:On the stalking story the angle is the media will label a guy a stalker even if the girl likes him if just The System doesn't want them to be together and the system may force the girl to lie so Lenora Claire and Ivanka Trump are both into Justin Massler but the system is trapping them and labeling him a stalker but he can see the truth because he has The Shining so he knows the system is forcing Lenora to lie so he's a superhero stalker who's a hero to these girls rescuing them from a media system trying to unjustly control them against their will.On the \textbf{mental} illness story it was just a misdiagnosis over he said things like he's Jesus Christ and they thought he was delusional but really he is Jesus Christ so it wasn't a delusion and he's not mentally ill. The Jesus Christ in The Bible is a metaphorical image of The Christ God like Neo or Harry Potter or Star-Lord and Justin Massler is The Avatar of The Christ God so he is who they call Jesus Christ.On the "What does he do?" angle he's just a Rogue Warrior in The \textbf{R\textbf{ed}} Cell Program which is like a real life A-Team Concept created by SEAL Team Six Founder Richard Marcinko to deal with things like how Israel's Mossad was behind 9/11 but a Zionist Conspiracy in the media is suppressing the truth.On The Kardashian Connection he's what \textbf{black} girls call Kim Kardashian's baby daddy as the baby daddy to \textbf{black} girls is the love father who the mother loves who the child takes after rather than the genetic father who the DNA comes from where like that's O.J.
