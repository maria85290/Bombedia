In fact a \textbf{black} family came to live there and enjoyed it very much, but they left due to the culture, because at the end of the day its 2 different cultures. There  no shame in admitting that. It's an Afrikaans town, with afrikaans culture and norms. It's no different than a white person choosing to go live in Soweto for example, if the white person can't adapt to that particular culture, then he/she will more than likely leave, that does not make Soweto a "Blacks only Town"  - at the end you might like it, but you might want to live among people with the same culture. This notion that Orania is an apartheid town is complete hogwash. it's media hype. It's private property developed with it's own infrastructure for like minded people who embrace the Afrikaans culture. It's about culture, not skin colour.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small ok a few things is so wrong about this report.  1) this settlement is a legal settlement under the law of self determination act in the South \textbf{African} constitution. 2) People living here are not \textbf{racist} as the reporter claims, they are white Afrikaans people who are tired of the corruption under the current ANC lead Government of south Africa  and the purposeful attempt of degrading and oppressing this White Afrikaner culture in South Africa.    In the recent years escalation of Brutal murders on White people,  the removal of Afrikaans as their language,  the exclusion of white people for the JOB market through BEE \textbf{Black} Economic Empowerment legislations and motivated this Afrikaner Whites to remove themselves from the broader Spectrum of South \textbf{African} Society  to be self determined, and Self reliant.  3) the majority of these people are Afrikaans spoken , Christians and White due to their Culture , \textbf{Ethnicity} and their views and shared ideals about, as  well as their worldview in religion.    No one is excluded of living or entering Orania,  to live here you are drenched in AFRIKAANS CULTURE, thus living here you need to be at peace with the modus operhandi.  4) Their currency is on par with the SA currency and is not above the South \textbf{African} Reserve.5)Although Orania lies within the borders of the Thembelihle municipal area, it is not an administrative part of the Thembelihle Local Municipality. Orania maintains its own municipal administration, while Thembelihle provides no services (such as sewerage, roads, rubbish collection) to Orania, and collects no rates from the town (other taxes are paid normally).In 2011, town rates for residents were between R1,500 and 2,000 per month. The town's existence is permitted by the Constitution of South Africa under a clause that allows for the right to self-determination.Orania has a non-confrontational attitude towards South \textbf{African} authorities, which have likewise adopted a non-interference policy towards Orania. The ANC government mostly avoids the issue of Orania and its status, as it is seen as less important than many other political issues the party faces. What is happening in France today with all the muslims?   Why don't the French assimilate with them?    Why do people HAVE to Assimilate with others?   why force people to get along with others?    If they don't they do not have to! before reporting on Apartheid places like Orania.   Come to visit the place or SHut up if you only go on hearsay!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African, Black, Ethnicity, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}7/404 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.733 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Fred Focus You bring up an excellent point, which confirms everything I think of white supremacist systems like this joke of a town. You will NEVER find  an all \textbf{black} community by design anywhere in the world, because colonization, white supremacy, and global anti-\textbf{black} sentiment have convinced even \textbf{black} people that whites are superior. Therefore blacks always embrace integration, miscegenation, etc... Whites, on the other hand, will tolerate blacks as long as the blacks know their place as an inferior subservient \textbf{race}.Ask yourself honestly if you think you are better than Blacks. (Of course you do!) Then ask yourself how long the former system of aparthied and oppresion could have possibly lasted in this evolving world. Finally, ask yourself why these whites don't just go back to their country of origin if they can't stand blacks so much. Classic white entitlement. Lol.The people of this town won't even teach their children about the love,  compassion, and perseverence of Madiba and other leaders (white and \textbf{black}) who tried to heal the country.

This is where Apartheid failed; bringing in blacks from the tribal homelands into the major cities and farms as \textbf{migrant} labour, when all it did was compromise the original intent of the Apartheid policy of maintaining \textbf{ethnic} homogeneity and development. White Oranians doing their own menial labour is as far from the \textbf{old} Apartheid system as you can get, and the scummy MSM tries to depict these people as bigots because they choose to live apart from other South Africans. As if they didn't TRY to co-exist for years, when blacks were assaulting them, killing their families and stealing their stuff. This is it is necessary for them to live separately.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Afika xundu I certainly wasn't confused. Identity and Culture are important. If they weren't There wouldn't have been protests over making Afrikaans the instruction language. You say that you have not seen someone lose their culture. Let's take the dismantling of institutions. Today there is a movement to remove Afrikaans from Stellenbosch. Further we have seen the removal of the Rhodes statue from Cape Town. These Institutions and Symbols are important parts to White South \textbf{African} cultures. Let's look to the United States where I currently live. Latinos move to the US from a number of countries in the Americas. Overtime these Latino communities lose their language. Second they lose their practices as they adapt to American culture. In  successive generations, these communities dissolve. Most White Latinos do not identify as Latino within 2 generations.Culture is in constant flux and change, however in a society like South Africa, where the ANC desires to erase the symbols and institutions of the White Minority due to it's connection to colonialism, imperialism, and Apartheid, it is no wonder that some would desire to preserve their culture.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}African & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!27}1/184 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.543 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Silas Bishop I'm not saying that identity and culture aren't important to preserve...my point is the method through which you preserve your culture must be flexible for everyone but preserving your culture isn't a problem. Most of South Africa's best schools and universities are English/Afrikaans-this doesn't accommodate for reserving \textbf{black} culture in South Africa yet \textbf{black} people have managed to preserve their culture despite this-in such a way that it accomodate everyone else yet they make up approx.70 of South Africa's population. I think it's great that Afrikaans people want to preserve their culture because it forms a part of their identity but i just don''t think that isolating yourself from the rest of the world in the way that Orania has in South Africa is the way things should be done. In my South \textbf{African} passport the front page says that we all should be able to move across our country freely-i don''t think that everyone is welcome to go to Orania. I also feel like the ANC is trying to balance the power-distribution in South Africa hence inowadays it's more difficult for white people t find jobs but it's not that their trying to erase white culture or identity. I mean, if you calculate the percentage of wealth distribution in South Africa, white people who are the minority (like you said) dominate a significant amount of it. So my feel is that the ANC are trying to balance that and it feels as though they are erasing white culture but really their not. (I'm addressing the one gentleman who moved to Orania because of job-difficulties) Again, culture preservation isn't a problem-it's how you preserve it that matters because we live in a country full of people so we all do have to share. \textbf{Nobody} can be selfish...i feel like that's some idea of what democracy is\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African, Black, Nobody & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!5}4/308 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.299 \\  \hline

This does not exist in \textbf{Black} \textbf{African} cultures to the same degree. The government should invest more in building this within \textbf{black} schools instead of trying to tear down the remaining schools. South Africans of all races send their children to these schools because they want them to have a solid education. ANC backed public schools are an absolute failure. Teachers can't even pass the tests they give. Orania represents a handful of people. Afrikaner culture exists and evolves in Jozi, Cape Town and in many rural areas of the country. You are correct, you would not be welcome in Orania to live. Neither would I. We aren't Afrikaners. The ANC is a corrupt institution looking to blame Whites for their failure to live up to their promises. The jobs policies are bad. Young White South Africans are leaving in droves. They take with them their education. The Country is suffering severe brain drain. Yes, White dominate the wealth and resources of the country. THis is in part due to colonialism, apartheid and in more current generations, education. Democracy must have safeguards from protecting minorities from majority tyranny.

As for the 'battle of blood river' again it was the Zulus who attacked the small group of Afrikaners. As for the Slaughtering that was England who did that and they slaughtered both the Afrikaners and Zulus and put the Afrikaner wifes and children in concentration camps and took their 2 countries the Free State and ZAR (now Gauteng province) away from them. Also the Zulus were chasing the other \textbf{black} tribes around and vice versa. The tribes were fighting each other and large tribes lived mostly in the areas where there kings now still live, although most were Nomadic having to flee from place to place so as to not get killed by a stronger \textbf{black} tribe. Those \textbf{black} kings who settled had in any event obtained that land by killing the Khoi and San people. Blacks lived with their kings and their wasn't so many of them. The country was scarcely populated, so their was more than enough space for everyone and each had their own country, but then the Afrikaners found gold and the English in Kimberley found diamonds, then the British army was promptly sent, just as the US is now sent whenever oil control is at stake. The Afrikaners never came to conquer like the British, they came mostly to flee from religious persecution, many being protestant and not catholic and mostly to just come and farm on land that was just bush and plenty of it. Anyway, one only hears of the Jewish concentration camps and not the Afrikaner ones. As for the bad deal of some treaties, yes that is true, but so did the Afrikaners lose their countries and after they regained it, lost it again in 1994 through 'democracy' that again only cares about \textbf{black} and white and \textbf{black} tribal violence and crime against whites can now fester without impediment or control. Without the self-defence that whites could only obtain through the Apartheid system there is now no hope for them. The argument now is don't worry about so many whites getting murdered, nearly just as many blacks are getting murderded, so it is just crime. The thing is whites could protect themselves with their own white police force and army like they did in Apartheid, but now they are not allowed to.....Soon they will be using the military weapons whites built to protect themselves with to shoot them,  all in the name of international sanctions and America's calls for 'Democracy'.

That is the goal in any event and it is what ww2 was about, but the white \textbf{race} lost. Forced multiculturism would follow and total annihilation of the white \textbf{race} as end goal. Who is behind it? Globalist Zionists? Was everything Adolf said true? Sure looks like it. As he said the only way they could ever rule over the European \textbf{race} is if they make it a bastardized \textbf{race} of mongrels and that is their goal! We know again, it is nearly too late.

I understand some words but like my Spanish can speak very little. I wouldn't want to learn Dutch because in the real world it carries no weight from an international  business or educational point if view globally. It's useless outside of Holland hence why very few bother to learn it. Secondly Yes South Africa was a Dutch colony but Afrikaners are a combination of Dutch, French Huguenots, German, Scandinavian, Malay and Khoisan. These are the facts. Afrikaners, their language and culture were formed in South Africa.Simply put they were settlers or slaves when they arrived, mixed and became AFRIKANERS...... not Dutch etc... but AFRIKANERS. If I use your poor logic once again, according to you the Zulu are also not indigenous to SOUTH Africa because their language started as a Bantu language from the Great Lakes area of central Africa and only reached the east coast of South Africa in the 16th century. Thats when the modern day Zulu language were created. In other words an "off shoot" of the Bantu language. Another way to look at your argument from an \textbf{African} perspective is like saying North Africans are not \textbf{African} because they speak a dialect if Arabic and French. Also over 50 of Afrikaans speakers are \textbf{black}...does that mean they are also not indigenous?See my point sunshine. I'm not going to stoop to your level calling you all sorts of names.

While blacks moved into white townships, whites aren't allowed to do the same. That would be gentrification. Why haven't blacks used their political and economic power to create new towns? Why is it always about consumption and taken over what has already being built? They wouldn't seize vacant land without expropriation. It always has to be a farmland with structures already on it. Orania has \textbf{zero} local crime by the way and the locals like to keep it that way.

Land was also bought and treaties entered into by the Afrikaners, they were farmers so had to bargain for everything they got - paying with cattle for additional land etc. Then Britain invaded and conquered the \textbf{black} Kingdoms and Boer Republics and took away all the borders and called it South Africa. The white government after independence gave the blacks all their Kingdoms back with full right to rule unrestricted. The \textbf{black} kings and presidents did not develop those countries causing all their subjects to leave and come and work in the white man's factories etc. When the white man leaves it becomes totally tribal again and everything falls apart.

This was purely design. Without questioning the Khoisan theory, some people are riding on the deception that these Khoisan owned the southern part of Africa which has now become South Africa. Truth is that there is a great variant of the khoi, san, basarwa, xhosa, batswana, bushmen etc. They did not identify as one homogenous group. They lived together but had deferential characteristics in how they lived and interacted. The funny part is that some people who have been identified as \textbf{coloured} by the previous regimes, are now thinking that they are the so called Khoisan whereas they are not. Some are even used by certain forces to falsely claim that they are kings of the indigenous community of the Khoi and the San.

Well for starters we were in South Africa before the Nguni tribes that make up almost 70 of \textbf{black} SA. We invented technology like the windpomp to conquer the 60 semi desert. We brought the wheel, rule of law, modern medicine that ensured your forefathers life expectancy grew from 32 to 68.

The few local inhabitants lived in small self sustaining communities. These small communities were totally unaware of the existence outside of their stone wall kraal. This may come as a surprise to you but they did not have cell phones, roads or any form of transport. They were totally isolated without any concept of provincial or country borders. So...what country are you referring to?During the 19th century the white man trekked into Southern Africa establishing towns etc. The country consisting of mostly non arable land, was uninhabited. The first non whites were found along the east coast in small communities. They were unaware of the existence of other tribes, boundaries etc. They did not even have means to cross rivers.

They say learn your history before you talk. well here is the history you speak of. The history of white colonial land dispossession dates back to the expansion of the Dutch colonial settlement in the Cape, which was established after the Dutch East India Company (DEIC) authorised Jan van Riebeeck to set up a refreshment station for their ships. Land was seized from the Khoikhoi and later the San to increase Dutch grazing pastures, expand their farming activities and to establish settlements. Over time, the increasing lack of access to grazing pastures by the Khoikhoi gave rise to conflict with the Dutch. While in some instances the Khoikhoi were successful, the Dutch defeated the latter and expropriated more of their land. As a result, the Khoikhoi and the San were systematically deprived of their livelihood forcing them to seek employment on the farmlands of white colonial settlers. Thus, the period between 1652 and 1799 is largely characterized by Dutch colonial expansion through occupation of land and resistance against this by the indigenous inhabitants.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}1/194 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.515 \\  \hline
