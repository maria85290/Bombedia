  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Racism is stupid and people who perpetuate or are entertained by \textbf{racist} behavior are also stupid. Additionally, this video does not represent the American perspective of Indians in America - AT ALL!  Indians in America can say whatever they like because they have no sway in America.  No one cares what they say or think because they are inconsequential in terms of American culture.  Indians are not trend-setters in America and there are very few Indians leading in any major industry of the US, other than in IT and some areas of science and/or medicine.Additionally, Americans do not see Indians as the "in the middle" \textbf{race} in the US.  Most Americans see Latinos as the "in the middle" \textbf{race} of America.  Indians have designated themselves as "brown people", but Americans refer to Indians as \textbf{Indian}.  When Americans use the term "brown people", they are referring to ALL people of color . . \textbf{Black}, Hispanic, \textbf{Indian}, Middle-Eastern, etc. - this term is typically used by Americans in conversations about diversity, to cover all people of color.I felt the need to clarify these points, but the bottom line is that viewing \textbf{racism} as funny is IGNORANT!

Where I live, a vast majority of individuals from that country aren't as \textbf{racist} as they are to not be accepting of other's cultures.  White people have a bad wrap for what they did in the past...which all cultures also did in the past. It's not like the Persian Empire was built upon the hard work of unpaid volunteers.... nah man they were all slaves. Where multicultural people include others into their cultures, others do what they can to not include them via not hiring them, not trying to acculturate to the country that you live in and consistently not attempting in any way recognize that \textbf{racism} is among all races...not just white people. Comedians are simply telling jokes and jokes are jokes and shouldn't really get to anyone if you pay to go see it so what this guy is doing isn't an issue... but reality is that Indians and all other races are capable of \textbf{racism} and need to be prosecuted for doing so.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}4/174 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.299 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small It always amuses me when \textbf{African} Americans go on about whites being \textbf{racist} land grabbers when they almost exclusively come from the Bantu \textbf{ethnic} group. The Bantu have been legendary for hacking their way through other \textbf{ethnic} groups in Africa and it's still going on today. Their treatment of the San, pygmies, Somalians today is extremely \textbf{racist}.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@imnotblackimoj I don't agree with \textbf{racism}. However putting loads of people together from different ethnicities does have its difficulties and makes for a more violent society in practice.  These problems become more pronounced as the people who where once a majority slowly become the minority. Minorities are often pushed out altogether especially if the majority resent the \textbf{ethnicity} of the minority and it would be safe to say that \textbf{Black} Americans have many reasons to feel resentful and these reasons will never go away. Giving up ones majority status on this planet has usually ended badly but maybe this time will be different. I am sure people could be trained over time to not identify with their particular \textbf{ethnic} group but it would take some doing as humans struggle to cope without some sense of identity to something.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Ethnic, Ethnicity, Racism & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}4/138 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.899 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Everytime you judge a person based purely on \textbf{ethnic} or racial attributes, you are, by definition \textbf{racist}. It may not be the same institutionalized \textbf{racism} \textbf{African} Americans and other \textbf{ethnic} minorities experience, but \textbf{racism} comes in many forms and manifests is various ways. Tribalism is ultimately to fault for this: it creates "otherness" and division, often being used ot justify subjugation of entire peoples. But it all starts the same with someone thinking their culture and traditions and people are superior or better than someone else's.  Indians are very apt at that.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small For all the idiots talking about caste system in India, let me explain what it is to you. Caste system was basically made to make people take certain responsibilities in development of the \textbf{nation} which means a man born in warrior caste will learn to become warrior since he was born, and leader caste guy will practise how to become leader since he was born. This was very effective and built the \textbf{nation} good but on the other side they felt the lower caste was being cheated here and also not all warrior caste men wanted to become warriors and not all leaders wanted to become leaders. So basically caste system affected one's career dreams, is that \textbf{racism}?? But in 1950 they banned it all. Now anyone can become anything, what they dream of. If caste system still existed in India PM Modi wouldn't have become leader in the first place because he comes from lower caste, which according to caste system he should be doing labour and not leader. But it's all gone now.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nation, Racism & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/175 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.714 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Aslan Ekhwan Blacks in the west are the poorest integrated but they intermarry with other cultures, support other cultures economically and even let other cultures like Indians into their communities to open up their businesses really? You gave one example of a Ugandan minister beaten up by Chinese labourers that is terrible but statistically its worse to have \textbf{black} skin in India than any other country in Asia. You say that all Asian countries have problems with \textbf{African} people that is your opinion. I stated earlier that all Asian countries are to some extent colourist and \textbf{racist} and that the caste system in India makes it worst there. If people have so much respect for Asian specifically \textbf{Indian} culture, why are Indians treated like dirt in Arab countries? I went to Dubai and saw Indians labouring in boiling hot sun being slaved out by arabs, many of them dying from overwork. Also I have seen Indians are being killed by Austrailian racists in videos that you can find allover youtube, so much respect there right? Indians have it good in \textbf{African} countries but with globalization and this kind of thing going on I don't think for much longer. To address your point about crime from \textbf{black} immigrants in western countries. You need to stop reading white supremacist propaganda, \textbf{black} people get harsher sentences for any crime committed than any other racial group most crimes are for drugs use a legacy of the police and organizations like the CIA flooding \textbf{black} communities with drugs and firearms in the 1980's. To sum up it doesn't matter what I say I am just a stupid "kalia" to you right? I have heard all kinds of \textbf{racist} slurs from Indians against \textbf{black} people even in western countries so don't deflect with the its just against Africans nonsense.

He also knew everyone including \textbf{black} are prejudice among others as well especially Orientals at that time.

You need to stop reading about pro \textbf{black} websites because the CIA drug conspiracy is a myth.The only sentence where \textbf{black} and white have different sentences are cocaine and that's only because powdered cocaine used by blacks is more easily distribute than solid cocaine.Also those harsh sentences were proposed by \textbf{black} judges in the inner city because they thought making the sentences harsher would save the \textbf{black} community from these drugs but it didn't work of course.  Support other culture?Did \textbf{black} support Chinese when they founded the biggest tech companies in US including Yahoo,Nvidia,Sandisk,Twitch,Youtube.Just because you're the customer it doesn't mean you help them because Asian American success is attributed to their hardwork and academic performance. caste system in India makes it worst there The richest Indians are dark skin. Caste system has \textbf{nothing} to do with dark skin otherwise Muslim which are fair skin wouldn't be treated even worst. lso google the Billionaires in Dubai. 80 of those billionaires are \textbf{Indian}.The hospital,hotels,tech companies in Dubai are owned by other Indians.In fact most of those \textbf{Indian}/Pakistani/Bangaldeshi labourers are mistreated by companies owned by other Indians. So the mistreatment is not a racial issue but a human rights issue in general. There wouldn't be a Dubai without Indians and this isn't an exaggeration.Also I have seen Indians are being killed by Austrailian racists in videos that you can find allover youtube, so much respect there right? Of course \textbf{racism} exist even towards Korean and Chinese.The whole point is none of them ever sulk and just wait for other races to give them what they want.It's also worth mentioning in all these countries you mentioned,\textbf{Indian} or Asians became the 1 despite the hardship you listed.Asian don't sulk about the \textbf{racism} like blacks and use the \textbf{race} card.If anything you made my argument.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Indian, Nothing, Race, Racism & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Ethnicity - Native-American & \cellcolor{green!5}11/314 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.503 \\  \hline

I guess you think that I am making it my experience about Indians who have racially insulted me and made all kinds of obscene racial comments about \textbf{black} people openly. Just be weary about promoting the "we are the model minority" card. Jews in Germany were a model minority and look what happened there, almost all of them were wiped out. So were the Japanese in the United States, things can change quickly especially under the current US president and no other non white groups can expect any solidarity with \textbf{black} people then. There are many \textbf{black} people doing well in the US and actually the Africans that you seem to hate so much do very well,  Nigerians for example have one of the highest average income levels for any \textbf{immigrant} groups in the US. I guess I am making that up to because I am a stupid "Kalia" right?

That is just my view. Not one you share obviously but one I do. As for your point about Martin Luther King it is a fair point and I am curious myself as to why he followed Gandhi.

Just by seeing some internet texts that too written by uneducated people , you think all the population goes around saying bob and vagene ?

The beginning was Egypt, which had \textbf{nothing} to do with the Europeans, Africans, or Orientals. The Pharaoh`s belief system was `the Lotus Flower`(the \textbf{Indian} Prince Buddha)The Eastern Civilizations in Egypt went corrupt(Babel) and were scattered which created The Middle East, Israel, India. The darker skinned people in South India were \textbf{African} slaves brought over by the Portuguese. The Eastern Civilizations are a very, very dysfunctional family. China, Russia, India are the main Asia Powers the rest is Indo-China. India was a Empire during the \textbf{Indian} Prince Buddha`s time.

In America Farrukh Bulsara(Freddie Mercury)is Iranian-\textbf{Indian} and the biggest rock group `QUEEN`` in the world. Ben Kingsley is Jewish-\textbf{Indian}, etc... India gave America the` The Love Generation ``TM Meditation -the Beatles -Looking back America will remember the 50`s/60`s as a time of the most freedom - India is a energy, the original energy from the beginning of creation -it is India that is related to all religions. The Avatars  Buddha, Jesus (real Jewish name(Yeshua/Yeshiva), etc.. of the Eastern Civilizations never wanted man to create religion. The  knowledge of the Avatars is a science of the body, mind and soul(eg Yoga) and Indians need to reconnect with that science  - the science of Knowledge, clear, honest, clean, humble, higher thinking... don`t ask for riches, gold ask for knowledge and then everything else will come.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African, Indian, Nothing, Racism & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Ethnicity - Native-American & \cellcolor{green!5}6/253 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.372 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small "do Indians abroad transpose the hierarchical structure they would have in India." This is a loaded question. In urban India, caste holds little importance (as opposed to rural villages).

BUT and this is a big but, caste does play a role for \textbf{Indian} marriages in the US. My personal theory is not so much that it's caste at play perse, but the fear is that the elders in the family will not disapprove of intercaste marriage, and if you know anything about \textbf{Indian} families, elders basically dictate everything. But this is also changing.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small All these Indians who complain about the British plundering their country must know that the rulers of India before British that is Mughals, and the feudal lords even before them had been plundering India and this phenomenon had prevailed for ages by the generations of feudal lords. It was basically the \textbf{Indian} version of feudal system of power and control through oppression and exploitation. What British merely did was wrested the top of that chain to get most of the goodies. Under the British hegemony, the former \textbf{Indian} feudal overlords served and helped the British in this process. In other words, feudal Indians were complicit in looting other Indians and they had no moral qualms about it because they had been doing it for ages. So Indians must shut up and before demonizing British must have a good look in the mirror.But the British presence was not bad for India. I think most of the Indians must thank the British because it was because of their presence, they got educated. While India was still lingering in middle ages, it is through the British they learned some lessons on civility and modernism. It is through the British the feudal minds of India became familiar with the modern concepts like democracy.  British were not in India to civilize the natives. They had their own business interests but it was with the British presence they learned a lot of things their feudal minds could not have dreamed. Gandhi and some of contemporaries got educated from London to lead India's struggle of independence. Without this education and resulting \textbf{mental} refinement, the Indians would have remained as rustic country bumpkins. Though British taught Indians English to make them useful as clerks, yet had they not done so, India would have remained in dark \textbf{age}.To recapitulate, the British were not worse than the \textbf{Indian} feudal lords, second, the Indians were hand-in-glove with British to plunder India, and third some really good things also happened to India because of British. So be grateful and thankful.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Indian, Mental & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Ethnicity - Native-American, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}5/340 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.471 \\  \hline

Indians are far more \textbf{racist} than blacks, whites, Hispanics, and other Asians.  Somehow they get away with but its not new.  Have a look at what the most famous and celebrated \textbf{Indian} (Ghandhi) wrote openly in print about blacks he encountered in South Africa, quite shameful and disgraceful, most of his initial "civil rights" efforts in that colonized country were to achieve \textbf{Indian} (brown) segregation from \textbf{African} (blacks).  He refused to give up his seat in the white South \textbf{African} first class section because he refused to suffer the indignity of having to sit with lowly indigenous \textbf{black} South Africans, no less \textbf{racist} than the American founders like George Washington and others who owned \textbf{black} slaves.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}African, Black, Indian, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Ethnicity - Native-American & \cellcolor{green!27}17/285 & \cellcolor{green!27}5.965 \\  \hline

Even Indians living in Africa have the audacity to look down on \textbf{black} people and refuse to integrate there. Lets look at the caste system and general colourism in India and how the darker skinned you are and how it affects your prospects of marriage and how there is an intense dislike of people with dark skin. Mahatma Gandhi one of the patron saints of India was one of the biggest racists ever. I don't know why Matin Luther King looked up to him say \textbf{black} people as inferior even though he himself lived in South Africa. Look at the many \textbf{Indian} and South Asian in general celebrities that have made all kinds of derogatory statements against \textbf{black} people Esha Gupta or Sarfraz Ahmad.
