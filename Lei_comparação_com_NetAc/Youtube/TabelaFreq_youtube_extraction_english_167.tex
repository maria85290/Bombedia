  \cellcolor{green!5}\small It's ironic our entire civilization from the books we read like Chaucer to Bacon to Aristotle to Jane Austin were prepared by individuals who had decades of experience.  What \textbf{ageism} is about is simply employers looking to hire cheaper and cheaper staff in a concerted \textbf{race} to the bottom.   Uber destroyed the Taxi industry taking full time work for people of different backgrounds and turning it into gig work with no stability and benefits.  All of the business risk is shifted to the drivers.   How does it feel that every worker has been turned into a commodity?  We are no more than cogs in a machine.

I almost cried every day while driving to work but stuck it out for 5 months without calling off until I found a job I love. I was blessed that my new boss actually preferred older workers because they are reliable, less likely to play on their phones while working, more accepting of constructive criticism, don't usually collapse under pressure and would never even consider asking for a \textbf{mental} health day!

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small It's about healthcare premiums that companies are having to pay to carry insurance for their employees.

Additionally, there are high level executives who are dead weight and they will not retire and they're never fired or laid off because they're locked into the buddy system. They have friends that are doing the same and they are all protecting each other.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Age discrimination also comes into play when it comes to just being friends.  The sad truth is, no one under 20..or 30..or 40 (pick your favorite number, doesnt matter) wants to have anything to do with anyone outside of their immediate peer circle. They feel they dont have anything in commmon; they dont fit in, they dont belong.But the reality is, thats not how society works. When you go out into the world, you will find that a community is made up of all different kinds of people, from various backgrounds, ages, races, etc.If we are to survive in this life, we all need to learn to work together and help one another. If we approached civilization as we did personal relationships, society would be strictly segregated into countless groups, each with a \textbf{common} thread and strong divisions keeping us apart. And it will eventually lead to our demise.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Common & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}2/151 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.325 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Sad that this happens still today, it's not only in the workplace, it's in social interactions as well. If someone accepts you are close to their \textbf{age} in dating for example but then they find out otherwise, many people will still reject you (even though at first they liked and accepted you). These is \textbf{crazy} to me, because it completely overlooks who we are as an individuals, and instead puts you in a biased preconceived narrow little box.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Crazy & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}2/78 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.564 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small This is a stupid argument. The young replace the \textbf{old}. If the previous generations dont set the younger up for success, it is the failure of the older, and all generations suffer. The older generations have continually driven civilization into the ground. Who is more to blame, the generation that failed to build a system that lasts and failed to mentor their own youth, or the generation that recognizes that the system is a failed one? Younger generations should prepare for the collapse and rebirth of civilization rather than keep failing as our forefathers and mothers have. Good luck all. Maybe think of how to not support the system of exploitation and debt slavery anymore. Maybe quit the identity politics of the globalists, that our forebarers created and realize we're all in the shit together.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}1/135 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.741 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Blanche Konieczka ~ I did leave last June  and the 5 star's  thing that's on line when you look at there  website went from 4 1/2 stars to 1 1/2 stars!  It's awful and some of the residents that had been there were leaving before I left but I really  loved them and they loved me! I took care of them like they were my grandmas and grandpa's!  I actually knew a handful of them from church and from when I was in middle Jr. High school and  Elementary School.  So they were very close to my heart and the bosses seem to only care about their paychecks and getting home to their parties or get togethers!   Once years before we had two bosses that were at the same place but they left because of how they were being treated. Those bosses we had were caring and cared about the nurses and CNA's and they would come in, in the middle of the night to help do the CNA work  or nurses jobs but the new bosses would not even answer their phone's!  I should have reported them but  everyone knows everyone in town so I didn't want to go down that road. One of my friends that's an RN  had a job for me but I broke my left foot in two places and it took a long time to heal and I'm still limping to this day. I love people but dislike drama from any \textbf{age} person like I was dealing with!  Yes I'm trying to do my own P.T. by myself  to strengthen my foot! I'm telling everyone if you know you've broken any bones in your foot then get to the doctor or hospital right away don't listen to anyone. I had to go 7 weeks with the broken bones and no one was listening to me till I got ex-rays on my foot.  Going to a podiatrist is much cheaper than a hospital and they can tell you what you need.   Thank you for caring.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/340 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.294 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Jennifer Vieira God bless you for caring for the residents as if they were family! The job from Hell was cooking in a nursing home and a handful of us cared about the residents but \textbf{nobody} else did. I was often close to tears when I had to cook and serve tiny portions of substandard food. My new job is cooking at Little Sisters of the Poor where their motto is "Making the residents happy". They really live by this motto and I've never loved a job more. I'll pray for your foot to heal and for you to find a job you love and where you're appreciated. You deserve the best!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nobody & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!27}1/112 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.893 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Blanche Konieczka ~ Thank you,  I did love caring for the \textbf{elderly} but it was like I have a curse on me and I never can make anything more than \$10.00 an hour my whole life. That's everywhere I go.  And I'm  about to go to the library to get two books on P.T. for my foot to strengthen it I make it strong again after breaking it in two places. I'm finding that very tiring which worries me and I need a gym to help me get my foot stronger again!  I'm just in a catch 22 with no job and needing to work out.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Elderly & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}1/106 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.943 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Jennifer Vieira you'll find a way. May I make a suggestion that might seem strange? Give it to God, put your trust in Him and He will provide. I was the head chef and kitchen manager in a job at an independent living facility and I adored my job. My company lost the contract and I was asked to stay by the facility but the way they took the contract away was sneaky, underhanded and just downright mean to my bosses. I declined because my bosses had become my friends and you don't stab your friends in the back. Was unemployed for 7 months. Didn't understand why because I have the skills, I rarely call off, my bosses gave me great references and I have a lot of experience. Realized it was my \textbf{age}, I'm over 60. I ran out of unemployment and used up my tiny savings. While driving home from my sister's one day I was praying for help and began to cry. I thought, I've done all I can. Put in applications almost daily for the past month, updated my resume and sent a customized cover letter with every application. There's \textbf{nothing} else I can do so it's in God's Hands. Then I prayed again, giving it to God, putting my trust in Him. Felt better and actually stopped worrying knowing the Lord had my back. Within 2 days I had 3 job offers! Ended up taking a nursing home job and when a new company took over and cut my hours, I went to another nursing home and it was the job from Hell. Used to ask God why He sent me to 2 places that didn't work out, but I persevered. Stuck it out for five months then finally found my dream job working for a charity feeding the \textbf{elderly} poor. They hired me because I had nursing home experience! God knew what He was doing! It all started when I put all of my trust in Him. Every time I'd start to worry I'd tell myself, God's got this and my fear and worry would slowly vanish. I'll keep praying for you! There's a line from a song on KLove, "Trust in the Lord and never give up hope, you're gonna do great things I already know. God's got His Hand on so don't live your life in fear, forgive and forget but don't forget why you're here.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Elderly, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!27}3/404 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.743 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small There is a generation or two between those you are talking about.

There will be a crappy tomorrow for us all if the mess is not fixed. But what do you oldies care if you dont live to see it.

She need's her hair done \& need's some glasses that aren't the type generally given to institutionalized people/Prison \& Psych patients. Also, a good attitude might help instead of complaining...she might ask what she might do to get a more positive response. I had an employer once that treated their people like family. They might ask to use your car to go to lunch or go look at a new car for them...so they knew how the people who worked for them would be treated. The vehicle at the very least would come back with an oil change and a full tank of gas or maybe new tires. No, I'm not joking. I once was called into the office and the owners were there with arm's crossed \& said that they had been watching me...OK, I'm in the office...!! They said that they still couldn't figure out how I was able to tell someone where to go with such elegance and have them smile and agree with me while I was doing it. Had many other wonderful experiences and Never got fired or laid off from a job in my lifetime\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/211 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.474 \\  \hline
