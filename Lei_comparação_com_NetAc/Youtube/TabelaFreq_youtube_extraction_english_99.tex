[LINK] 1984 interview with a former KGB agent and Soviet diplomat, Yuri Bezmenov.Reminds me of the many reports regarding American and Canadian daughters of a bitches in America and Canada which is an overboard political correctness cultural marxism country which we Russians created to destroy the American and Canadian family. destroy the family then you destroy the brick of society, destroy many bricks then the entire building goes down. That building is the American and Canadian \textbf{nation} and we of the former KGB now known as the FSB are very proud of what we just did and you Canadians and Americans think you won the cold war? No! We russians won the cold war for we have destroyed the western family! Destroy the family then society collapses, when society collapses then the economy collapses, when the economy that supports the military collapses then all U.S and Canadian militaries collapses.We Russians won the Cold War for look at your societies, over 50 divorce rares, out of control insane feminism, indiscrimination against the while caucasian male \textbf{gender} in all walks of life, the feminization of education in order to destroy  the intellectual and \textbf{mental} potentials of boys and men by deliberately ignoring their educational and intellectual needs by ignoring the difference of thinking pattern between male and female, open and outright  indiscrimination against male co-workers in the work place and places of learning, etc.Political correctness is TYRANNY WITH A SMILE. PC particularly serves mediocre politicians and the bureaucrats they appoint.  It is used to hold on to jobs, silencing critics and threatening anyone who questions their abilities.  If the offended party can strike back with accusation of \textbf{racism}, discrimination, prejudice, and hatred, then PC has done its job.  PC is a way of covering up incompetence and corruption.  It has worked well in the U.S. for decades: attack the accuser.  Benjamin Jealous, president of the NAACP, wrote, "Let me tell you something about political correctness: when politicians start overdoing it with PC, rest assured they're either hopeless at what they do or have screwed everything up big time.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender, Mental, Nation, Racism & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General, Gender - General, Nationality - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}5/534 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.936 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Regardless if someone is male or female, it should be judged on priority.

At the same time, if there was a healthy, capable female sitting and there was a male who was clearly \textbf{disabled} or had difficulty standing, said female SHOULD give up her seat. I think 99 of people, male or female would give up their seat for a person in more need and videos like this are just making a meal out of \textbf{nothing}. One time I worked as a labourer on a construction site. Riding the bus home I was absolutely knackered from hard labour and I had become ill from the cold conditions. I was clearly in a bad state and a nice young girl, dressed formally offered me her seat. Im not a \textbf{woman} and I certainly wasn't pregnant, I was just in more need to sit down than her.

The balance of the natural order has been turned upside down deliberately, by some of the most evil people the west has ever known. The more subtlety used, the more evil it is. Never has their evil been so subtle or so many people been so taken in by it. So many men see no hope in society. Their jobs, good character, financial security, and finally, their dignity, have all been taken off them and given to women. At the same time, women are encouraged to deprive men of their children, home, jobs and again, with all of that always goes dignity. THESE are the reasons the despicable TV panel lead discussion  shows deliberately ignore, and patronisingly say 'poor men' without helping in any constructive way. Feminism and the \textbf{misandry} that ALWAYS goes with it, and gynocentric biased law systems are DESPERATELY EVIL.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Is it sexist to offer a \textbf{woman} a seat? c4news took to the the streets, armed with a folding chair, to find out:  [LINK] \normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/24 & \cellcolor{green!5}4.167 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small For me its not about the \textbf{sex} of the person you give up your seat for but how able are they to stand compared to you or me!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Sex & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/28 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.571 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I'm all for equality in all forms. If the person in question is in need of a seat then I'll stand up. There are plenty of examples of \textbf{sexism} against men as well. This is a bit left field but why do news organisations always report deaths as a total and then say: including x number of women and children. I can understand differentiating between children and adults but not between men and women.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Sexism & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/74 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.351 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I don't believe there should even be a debate about this.  Anyone who has any manners and was brought up correctly would offer an \textbf{elderly}, \textbf{disabled} or pregnant \textbf{woman} (or \textbf{elderly} gent) a seat without a second thought!  The word 'sexist' is just an excuse for those without manners who are boys, lads, gents and not gentleman, just as there are girls, babes and ladies who lack the same respect for \textbf{elderly} men, the \textbf{disabled} and so on.  It appears that this word is whipped around all too easily whenever PEOPLE (men and women) are expected to display basic manners..(I witness unacceptably bad mannered people (80 are our youngsters and college goers) on the bus very often in Bristol).  It has absolutely \textbf{nothing} to do with being 'sexist', it's about simple manners.  Let's not forget that it has been a traditional display of good manners for centuries for men to stand up for a lady or the \textbf{elderly} but that is not to say that women shouldn't have a responsibility to offer up their seats to those in need also...any lady with any manners does offer their seat...I know I have done on many occasions with young students seated right next to me! Finally, how a pregnant \textbf{woman} carrying a tiny gift within her wasn't offered a seat today, is beyond me ... a sign of the times and how badly mannered our own government really is. How disappointing indeed.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Disabled, Elderly, Nothing, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s, Age - Youngsters, Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}9/240 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.75 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small A pregnant \textbf{woman} not offered seat and she is equality minister. First thing that would come in my mind which no one seem to consider. Did she want the seat? With how far women take equality this equality that these days I won't be surprised if she actually had a go at a few of the for offering her seat and is she the only female there? If not is it not sexist for only males to get picked on? I honestly think there is more to this story than just the question asked because I can't honestly think this would happen in the house of commons of all places for no reason. I'd get really worried about our leaders otherwise.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/121 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.826 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small And just maybe if the driver did't set off too soon we would have time to sit down safely, i've seen a few \textbf{elderly} wobble down the aisle for the sake of a few seconds!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Elderly & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}1/35 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.857 \\  \hline
