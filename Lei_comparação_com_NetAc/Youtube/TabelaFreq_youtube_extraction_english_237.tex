  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I live in the west and majority of white people here are absolutely trash as far as education goes and professional know-how, together with a 9-to-5 mentality and poor work ethics. Also it is very well known that white people after the \textbf{age} of 25 and 30, especially the women, they go and appear to look like they are 45 or something, their skin quality turn real bad fast, it is also known that white people have bad odor problems, asians genetically have lesser sweat glands producing less body smell. so the stereotype that white people possesses all the good qualities are all false. Also in Japan there was or still is a trend of women going for a sun \textbf{tan} darker skin, so the stereotype that all asian women want fairer white toned skin is false aswell.

My dad is a dark skin man, but he's someone that will make remarks about darker skin, especially women.

Why not show them a better example of white people? Telling them to hate me for the color of my skin just creates more division. I want to do good for the world, to benefit and to help Chinese children. Am I really bad because I am white?

It is was truly impossible to find any job without Chinese knowledge, regardless of how hard I have tried.  White skin: I really don't agree with the Chinese traditional consideration of white skin is more beautiful. My GF, and also other Chinese girls, are definitely more beautiful when they have dark(er) skin.  For me! However, protecting the skin from the sun is healthy as the ozone layer is already quite \textbf{thin}.Chinese girls like a white man: I haven't noticed that.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The problem is how things are presented to students. For example its one thing to expose them to Western culture so that they may have some understanding of the outside world since Chinese society tends to be homogeneous (most people do not encounter other races or \textbf{ethnic} minorities on a daily basis), but its another thing to present these things in a way that paints other cultures as being better or something to aspire to. For example the girl who said having a white person represent a company is accepted by many as improving a company's image because this is a traditional mindset. What? Lol a traditional mindset would be something like respect for the family ancestral line or the honoring of ancestors through food offerings and prayer. She even used the word 傳統 to describe it. How can worshipping white people be traditional when white people barely got on the scene? Either that girl has no idea what 傳統 means or she doesnt know traditions because the traditional culture has been lost. If you interviewed real Chinese people meaning ones that know the actual culture and dont just look Chinese on the outside, this video would be a LOT different. Also Chinese can have skin lighter than white people and darker than white people. The preference for light skin stems from farm workers being outside traditionally and thus tanning and having darker skin, whereas lighter skinned people did not do manual labor and could be inside. It has \textbf{nothing} to do with so-called white people such as Europeans but many of them like to think that way to make themselves feel better. Another way in which white people bend the truth to make themselves feel superior. I guess they have to do that because fantasy is all they have.

I hardly see any dark skinned actors or actress on TV in India, the Philippines or Malaysia where most people have dark skin.  Thailand too.  Korea is the leader in cosmetic surgery operations and skin whitening products.  It is too bad, people are brainwashed by the white-trash mentality.  That is the reason Asians still cannot form its own alliance or free trade agreement among Asian countries like the North America's Free trade or the organization like NATO.  Asians are not working together but they often working against each other among themselves for the West leading by the US to take advantage of.  Asians rather have the control by the control \textbf{freak} US than work together with China for \textbf{common} goals to make Asia a more peaceful, more stable, and more prosper place for all Asians to enjoy.  Rising China has made positive contribution to all of Asia.  But other Asian countries see that as threat to them.  How come they never complain about the control over them by the US who is the most powerful and control \textbf{freak} in the world?  How can China control them more than the US?  How much the US has benefited Asian countries economically and politically?  You don't have to look further,.  Just look countries that are allies to the US, have their countries do better or worse?  The Philippines is a good example that it has been the ally of US for long time, but it is still one of the poorest and most corrupted country in Asia if not in the world.  By the way, Philippine has been doing well for a country after having good term with China.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I'm sorry but, I'll have to disagree with most of the comments on here. Yes everybody's entitled to their own opinion, including myself. But, even though the history says that, pale equals rich and dark equals poor. Asian people still have a color complex and superiority complex. This doesn't count for the entire \textbf{race} but, most of them do feel this way. People can say what they want, if I and my family went to China right now, my husband who is white and my kids because they have fair skin and white hair, would automatically be considered as Superior. But me, because I'm \textbf{black} with dark beige skin or \textbf{tan}, whatever you want to call it. I would be considered unattractive, dangerous and, possibly poor because I'm darker than my family. Asian people have worshipped and put white people on a pedal stool for decades and centuries now. Like I said before, not the entire \textbf{race} feels this way, but most of them have and still do. And the reason why they do this is because, most of them learn what they see on television and a base people off what they see on mainstream and not to mention, most jobs and companies are owned and ran by white people. So, they'll assume that "white is right" and they don't even like themselves so which means, they don't like anybody else. I think most of these people have a \textbf{mental} issue and self-hate for themselves and others and, it needs to be corrected with communication, education and self-help. Because, it will never get better and it will never change, if they don't. To look at yourself and others and feel that, you're inferior and someone else is Superior; is a \textbf{mental} problem. I think Asian people and anyone else including \textbf{black} people, can be beautiful and good and, I don't think you have to be white to be polite and kind.

In PRC I found the workers and customers were more OK with respecting the knowledge I had about technical aspects of work than in Taiwan. The Chinese Taiwanese I met there were really friendly to me as soon as they heard me talk, because they noticed my accent etc and straight away knew from my talking what accent that was but if you are a non-Chinese \textbf{immigrant} (some of who were already here several generations because of those who came in 1949 from mainland China but were not Han Chinese...) or Aboriginal Taiwan citizen here in Taiwan you will face some bad attitudes here in Taiwan. On the other hand it it is really frustrating in PRC when we (the 5 or so of ROC, ie Taiwan people) who are not ethnically Chinese people can't believe we exist, say some BS like "this can't be real, you are not Chinese and all Taiwanese are Chinese".

Since humans are incredibly driven by aesthetics and looks this became a norm, to the point the nobles would paint themselves with rice powder.This skin distinction wasn't so pronounced in Europe because the sun doesn't shine so bright in those latitudes and the place is cold, so even under the sun you'll be wearing clothes to protect your skin. In fact, rich people nowadays are inverted in such sense in American and European cultures. They have a lot of time to travel so they are constantly tanned and people that work a lot have lighter skin because they spend their time working inside buildings who don't happen to \textbf{tan} their skin!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Tan & \cellcolor{green!27}Nationality - British & \cellcolor{green!27}1/181 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.552 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small There are many wrong perceptions about Chinese people, especially in some Westernised countries, where I live. I use to live in Foshan, and I never felt so comfortable, safe and welcomed. To me, it does not really matter if Chinese look whiter or darker, their skin does not determine the traits of their character.  There are many ugly shrubs, which produce much \textbf{fruit}, while there also lovely looking trees that lack a produce in the time of harvest. It is the inside that counts.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small On the skin brightening thing, I really need to comment on it. China's admiration of whiter skin color is not at all coming from white people per se, but rather it's because in the \textbf{old} times, if you work on a outdoor job, like farming, you are much more likely to be exposed under the sun extensively resulting in darker skin,whereas  if you come from a more well off family, you mostly work indoor and less likely to have darker skin.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small but isnt this the true philosophical debate? you always want the thing that is most different from you, or find it attractive. Now for me, im an average looking white guy, I always thought asian women, like japanese were soo much more beautiful compared to alot of the american women ive dated. But now I live in Japan, I find the opposite is true. Alot of the japanese women, tell me, it is very exciting for them to be with a foreign guy, and that, that is the ideal vision of beauty. Its interesting for me, because I have always felt completely the opposite. Them, oh foreigners, are more beautiful. Me, oh yea Japanese are more beautiful. So then goes the fact that whichever is farthest away from you, or opposite of you, would be obviously very attractive. Personally Ive always like asian women, cuz I think they look very exotic, compared to average americans, which is this huge mixing pot. So it goes to show you just love what is not you. Asians will love blue eyes, cuz all them have \textbf{black}/brown. Asians will love blonde hair, cuz they all have \textbf{black}/brown hair. I have mixed, \textbf{colored} eyes, but also kind of brownish, Ive always loved if a girl has blue eyes of course. If a girl has \textbf{black} eyes and is asian, its fine too. What most matters to me is a cute face, because, that is what i have to talk to everyday, kiss, etc. One that does not wear too much makeup, a little sometimes ok however. She has a nice smile, etc. This seems to be the most important.  The point is, people from one continent, lets say the asia area, will obviously be very attracted to the complete opposite looking person, say america, and alot of americans the same. but I think it matters how much you have dated.. etc.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Colored & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!27}2/316 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.633 \\  \hline

They spent a good deal of time talking about pale skin and everything, not Caucasians or racial superiority or anything. Here's some background story. People in China generally believe that having dark complexion means you are a peasant because only peasants working in the field would get sun \textbf{tan}. This belief remains unchanged for centuries. Interestingly, the European aristocracy shared the same belief long time ago. The entire French court in the 17th century, and later the Brits, was so obsessed with "white" face that all aristocratic women and men painted their face white, even though the makeup contained lead and caused a lot of damage to their facial skin. Additionally, many \textbf{African} cultures prefer pale skin over dark one, and for that reason, skin bleaching has been a \textbf{common} practice for centuries in many tribes or regions in Africa, despite the fact that it can cause healthy concerns and some countries, including South \textbf{African}, have even banned it. So it has \textbf{nothing} to do with SELF-HATE.

Also in Japan there was or still is a trend of women going for a sun \textbf{tan} darker skin, so the stereotype that all asian women want fairer white toned skin is false aswell.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small edit: I'm surprised that this comment has gotten so much attention, let me reiterate for those who are not familiar with the situation in Asian countries (for those who have or are living in Asian countries, you know what I'm saying). The definition of a trash foreigner is someone who 1). doesn't have the ability or credential but gets much higher pays (sometimes through lying) when compared to locals with more work experiences or higher educational background 2). (Most importantly) abuses the culture and its people, use their \textbf{nationality} or \textbf{ethnicity} to get laid, talk trash about the country and its people while enjoying all the undeserved love (sometimes the symptoms can be not able to speak a word in the local language even after years of living there) . I've seen and heard of so many cases where foreigners find at least a dozen girls over the span of weeks; there are always cases of rape, obnoxious behaviors (e.g: Logan Paul and Ricegum) etc. You cannot compare immigrants to the US to these kinds of foreigners in China, immigrants are hardworking people trying to fit in and trying to make a decent living. Those trash foreigners only want to get \textbf{sex} and easy money  and GTFO of the country they are taking advantage of. The foreigner scene in China is polarizing, divided between extremely openminded and or well-educated individuals and absolute trash. Original comment: Honestly, I think if they understand the "foreigner scene" in China more, the more disappointed they will be. Many foreigners in China (especially whites from more developed nations) are so-called trash foreigners, basically meaning they are the people that cannot find jobs in their home country so decided to move to China to seek opportunities (by taking advantage of their white looks). It's sad to see how people believe those people to be more knowledgeable and capable than hard-working young locals.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity, Nationality, Sex & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General, Gender - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/316 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.949 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Let me explain you: when a Chinese goes to your country to work it's about the individual. If you go to China to work, the point is "what does China need?". This is why the law states that if same conditions, the Chinese must be hired first, and why workers withouth great background will not be accepted, as they are not useful for the country.Yet you will see a citizen from a country thas has that mentality (which is legit, of course, the have the right to manage their own country as they wish) call you loser or trash when in fact you will only work there if you're very good at your field. Forget about the "honest and willing workers" because that doesn't apply to China, it's not about honesty, it's about filling the needs of the country in a way a Chinese would not be able to (that's what the law says, obviously there are many Chinese workers who are just excellent, my working place, just to set an example, has many of them). It's legit, of course, but that doesn't deny the fact that it's hypocritical to say this when you're exporting low-background workers to other countries and only welcoming those who are highly qualified.So what's with the "taking advantadge thing"? Actually it's part of the Chinese \textbf{racism}, parents want a foreign face to claim how good his kid is at English, it's also about face, reputation, call it the way you want. A \textbf{black} teacher with a Princeton degree may be the best option you will ever have, but if you hire him the parents won't be able to tell his friends and relatives that his kid is in a western sophisticated environment, because his teacher his \textbf{black}, who knows if he may come from Africa? So, who creates the topic? The \textbf{black}/white teacher, or the costumers that are behind that? But here you see the final result by reading the comments: the Chinese being \textbf{racist} it's your fault, so you should be ashamed because they have the right to be \textbf{racist}. Don't get me wrong about that, to me it's very disgusting to see parents cheated in such a terrible way, paying a lot of money that they earned by working hard just to have an unqualified teacher.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Hi, sorry to make you feel this way. I think the translation caused a lot of misunderstanding. Our pursuit of brighter skin like jade has \textbf{nothing} to do with \textbf{race}. It's a standard comes from ancient time, even before we knew the existance of white people. I don't know how ancient asian thinks, but now Its just that we east asian have flatter face, being brighter can make our features doesn't look that flat, and compliments the gentleness of our smaller eyes and nose, makes us feels we are cuter somehow. Its hard to describe. Its definately not about \textbf{race}.

The Asian and Asian American communities aren't as woke as they should be, often looking down on our own brothers and sisters. Too many uncle Chans and auntie Chans. Those influences from colonization still live on today. We learn about all the great things white men did in history, watch movies, shows, and commercials that star them.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small It is called reverse \textbf{racism}. For one because we have slanty eyes so we like bigger eyes. Another reason is economic status. European countries are more developed in the past century. In Chinese culture, I think deep down people only worship power and money. That's the reason many Chinese feel white folks are superior. But as Chinese economy has been growing, even though individually our living standard still has a lot to catch up with the West, the \textbf{nation} itself has become a huge power that cannot be ignored. So more and more Chinese stopped looking up to white folks and the West and start having a false sense that Chinese are the best.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small You grew up in one country in Africa... That does not give you magical insight into a whole \textbf{race}. It reminds me of how I lived in South Africa and had relatively peaceful days interacting with different races, then I moved away and apparently, people in South Africa are killing each other over \textbf{race}. Then again, this is anecdotal. Also, I feel to weirdly prove your point, you've also somehow vouched for the other side. Especially with your drivel about men pursuing women. Honestly, it has done \textbf{nothing} to prove that Asians don't worship white men (I personally don't care if they do, that is not my problem as a Kenyan, I am solely interested in "decolonizing the mind" a la Ngugi Wa Thiong'o ). Also, there are plenty of white countries and Asian countries with higher homicide rates than a good portion of Africa. Also, it is \textbf{Indian} Americans that push the earning gap for Asians. Not sure why that goes unnoticed, but other Asian groups aren't out earning anyone. Furthermore, to come at the \textbf{black} \textbf{race} when countries like Korea have the highest per capita plastic surgery rate is just something. On that note, not sure how we went down this path when white supremacy and the Western world have affected both continents negatively. I notice Churches in Asia are filling up slowly and in Africa they have been full for a long time. I notice that music in Asia is largely becoming rap and bubble gummy pop. At least Africa has seen a rise of Afro pop but folk music is to my discontent, dying. I have no intentions of getting married but honestly, finding a good partner in life is difficult so if you are married outside of your \textbf{race} and it makes you happy, so be it. I am also one of those \textbf{black} women who wears their naturally curly hair and quite frankly, there is a massive hair movement in the \textbf{black} community right now which is great! I will say, I see more of these type of moments in the \textbf{black} community than Asian community which is probably why there is the assumption that Africans have more pride.

Women want to be seen as the smaller and "fairer" \textbf{sex} biologically regardless of any socially imposed feminist ideology. Guys also want to be seen as more bigger, masculine and stronger than women, and since having darker skin to females plays to all of those "male" attributes, guys also prefer women with a lighter skin tone to themselves. Of course it depends on the general skin tone of that group of people.I'm a Latin guy with light brown (type 3/4 skin), and I also prefer women with a skin tone at the very least a little lighter than my own and I don't really think of it any differently compared to preferring a \textbf{woman} shorter in height than myself. However, unlike height, skin colour is not a deal breaker for me all at all. Height, body shape and personality are far more important to me in a \textbf{woman} than skin tone.

To list a few of China's most precocious innovations in the field: 1) A functionally complete calculus of fractional operations (not to mention symbolic positional decimal notation) by -300, echoes of which can be seen in a recently recovered coordinate multiplication table from Qin.  2) A binomial expansion algorithm for root extraction with a Ruffini-Horner optimisation, first applied to square and cube roots in the -1st century Nine Chapters , and eventually to polynomials in the Middle Ages.  3) Also in the Nine Chapters, the world's first general solution for systems of linear equations, expressed as a square matrix of coefficients, via an algorithm known to the West as Gaussian elimination (absent in the West before Isaac Newton).  4) As a distillation of operations with systems of linear equations, the world's first functionally complete calculus of negative numbers, including multiplication (sign inversion), by 3rd-century commentator on  Nine Chapters Liu Hui.  5) This one not strictly algebraic, but well-worth considering: the Cartesian coordinate system, plotting dependent variable (virtue) against independent variable (time), this one casually invented by none other than the most educated \textbf{woman} in ancient history, Ban Zhao, in her contribution to the  Hanshu .If this tiny list of Chinese contributions alone doesn't strike you as "seriously important," then you are welcome to shun them for what they are and go back to counting livestock with your fingers...Physics: While it makes little sense to speak of physics before Isaac Newton, the classical Micians, 2000 years before Newton, did have an accurate concept of the properties of gravity and its relation to directional force and motion (see Mojing B 26, 27), which is farther than Aristotle got around that time.  They were also the first in recorded history to describe the optics of concave and convex mirrors.Chemistry: this field didn't even exist until about 200 years ago when atomic theory was developed (or ~240 if you start with Antoine Lavoisier's stoichiometry).  Before that, virtually all of Western knowledge about matter was based on alchemy of the Four Elements which basically involved trying to burn everything to see if it turns to gold.  At least the Chinese made good of something with their experiments in the form of *gunpowder*... so that ol' \textbf{whitey} can "discover" a new continent by heroically stealing it behind a matchlock from the least fortified peoples on Earth, then go on to call it "insignificant!"  SMHBiology: fair enough, the Chinese really did \textbf{nothing} for this field.  "TCM" is an abomination that needs to be wiped out.  But believe it or not, the late Warring States Chinese were the world's first ecological conservationists in their rationale for regulating seasonal hunting and forestry.Geology: Um... the world's first seismoscope?  Hello!  I thought you were "very well informed on Chinese history."  Anyways, considering how the Chinese invented crop rotation and various practical soil sciences (ridge-furrow planting, anyone?) that define modern agriculture and are a big part of what sustains the Earth's population, I don't see how it could be less important than knowing the difference between a stalactite and a stalagmite...Car: fossil fuel (-3rd century); helical (chevron) gearing (-2nd century); crank-and-connecting rod reciprocal motion mechanisms (-2nd century; first seen in Han rotary querns, industrial-sized winnowing fans, and floor looms) that underlie the internal combustion engine (and the steering wheel)...  Oh, and as for that steel chassis, um...: blast furnaces and decarburised steel (since Han era).Plane: kite gliders (-4th century), rotor blades (and rotary sculling fans in general, like winnowing fans, from -2nd century at the latest), hot air balloons (flying lanterns), rocketry.  Can't take off without at least one of these."steamed ship": Hey genius, try crossing the Atlantic in an 800-foot ship without bulkhead compartments and a rudder... or a compass... or steel, for that matter.  All insignificant things, I'm sure.Computer: binary arithmetic (as implied by a -2nd-century epigraphic reordering of the Changes (OG text circa -9th century) from Mawangdui).

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Actually, the scientific fact is that preferring white or whiter skin is something that is ingrained in our \textbf{sexual} psychology throughout human evolution. In every \textbf{race} of humans, even from the darkest \textbf{black} people to the whitest white people, there has always been preference for those who are whiter within a population. The reason is that fair or whiter skin indicates youth and fertility, as skin naturally darkens through \textbf{ageing} and after menopause when women become infertile. Dark skin is also an indicator of skin damage through formation of freckles, \textbf{age} spots and other discolorations. And since East Asians have always had a preference for more youthful looks compared to other races and ethnicities, it is natural that we prefer whiter skin as it relates to the attributes that humans naturally find youthful.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Ageing, Black, Race, Sexual & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}5/133 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.759 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small And another thing I want to point out, East Asians sometimes wear cosmetic \textbf{colored} lenses and in our manhwa, manhua and manga, the characters have \textbf{colored} hair and eyes because they want to be identifiable and distinct personalities for the reader to relate to. As in comics, characters look very much alike due to the cartoonish artstyle, so coloring of hair and eyes are used to differentiate between characters who would otherwise look alike due to the ambiguity of the design of comic characters if coloring were not used (which in \textbf{black} and white comics, would mean differentiation of characters happening through fashion and hairstyles instead of \textbf{colored} hair or eyes). And this same reason applies to real life when girls wear \textbf{colored} lenses, to show off their individuality as naturally, East Asians all have \textbf{black} hair and dark brown eyes, so wearing \textbf{colored} lenses allows girls to stand out from other girls to draw attention to themselves as girls love attention and being the center of it. So \textbf{colored} lenses are entirely about wanting to be unique, individualistic, receiving attention and standing out from the crowd, NOT because we want to "be Caucasian".

Due to their environment and lack of civilisation knowledge they would sleep with their dead one's and not but u them, drink blood of each other, steal from each other and lie to each other when a little of bit of food would grow so not a lot of them would eat all of it out. Then when the Africans recused them from their inhabitant abode and taught them how to be civilise. They the whites started having kids with the Africans and slowly adopted their custom and took over their culture, and used their kids as a tool to oppress their \textbf{African} side. Eventually conquered , and used that as an ideology of survival of the fitness, in terms if what the animals do howvebr in his book mentions that whites Don't really believe that in fact they use ancient \textbf{African} knowledge to control world e.g sepiroth knowledge= tree knowledge which they got from ancient Egypt, and nilo valley. That been said developed an alter ego called the other which allows them to justify their evil ways of projecting victim mentality in the act of oppressing blacks. Why because \textbf{black} people r genetically dominant, they \textbf{age} slower,  their organs r built different which is why whites steal them, the \textbf{black} man and \textbf{woman} can repopulate themselves in any other non-\textbf{black} men or women non-blacks can only repopulate themselves in themselves. Blacks r envied also for their historical achievements, remedies maths science physics, architectures, fashion, beauty, style which started with blacks first, prymids how we built as multi stone computer system activate by sound and also a heath care place. Also blacks r envied and hated for their intellectual potential in sports and how over 100 of the invention all nations use that descended from \textbf{black} people was invented by \textbf{black} people and some they did before slavery and some in slavery and after slavery while been oppressed and without going to the same schools as white kids.

However, unless you're white with hair that stands out (incredibly long, incredibly wavy/curly, incredibly bright such as platinum blond/red, etc.) a \textbf{black} person will attract WAY more attention for their hair (I have stories for DAYS about random Chinese people coming up and grabbing my hair).White is right, most definitely.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small There's a natural standard of beauty.

As a tall white guy with brown hair and bright blue eyes who's been called very attractive in both the States and my time in China, SKorea, Japan and even Guam, when I was in Suzhou, I was fawned over by the Women there.

But the level of privilege that you have as a white person in China is well known (job prospects/opportunities), white people here acknowledge as well because it is so blatant. I've seen it within my own place of employment, because Chinese parents prefer their kids to be taught by white teachers, because they feel it their child would be more cultured and poised.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Sneffe I am glad that you can understand what I want to express and that's why you can guide me about similar English words. I could educate you if you don't mind. Just another window for your understanding of the world. No \textbf{racism} in China, Almost 100 Chinese are the same \textbf{race}. No concept of racial discrimination inter-China. Somebody believe \textbf{nationalism} and populism, just like Westerners, but government oppress any kind of \textbf{nationalism} prevent China into countries like Nazi-Germany and former Soviet Union. You shouldnot just want to listen words what you willing to listen, the objective fact is not transferred to the will of human beings. You just want to listen ppl praise that you Caucasians are with good skin and deny the fact East Asian are those who have better skin. I can applogise for my misusing adjective to describe what Caucasian's skin looks like. For better understanding, I suppose you take the Chinese sentences as standard, ignore the English version. And you must realize that Chinese have its own rule define fair skin and almost social science. You have any doubts and thoughts even angers towards this issue means I finally achieve my goal, help ppl understand different concept about Chinese fair skin and Caucasian one. After all, Marco Polo envied rich wealth of ancient China and China's fair skin. If possible, you can help me modify my English version sentence, a better communition, help ppl view the world with dialectical point of views.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nationalism, Race, Racism & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}4/247 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.619 \\  \hline

Many 'White' people are so tanned that they are more orange than 'white,' but that doesn't change their \textbf{race}. 'White' isn't exactly a \textbf{race}, but it refers to Caucasian people with European descent. Many \textbf{Black} people aren't '\textbf{black}' either. They range from light to dark brown. You see? Don't get too focused on the color. The terms '\textbf{Black}' and 'White' were invented by racists to separate the two back in the days.

YOU ALL KNOW GOOD AND WELL that when someone says you are \textbf{black}, white, \textbf{y\textbf{e\textbf{llow}}}, \textbf{r\textbf{ed}}, or brown that they are NOT talking exclusively about skin color. Who would have thought that anyone would have to clarify that? It boggles the mind that people think in such literal terms, when LITERALLY - you have seen crayons and you know that no one's skin (or very few people) is actually WHITE, \textbf{BLACK}, \textbf{Y\textbf{E\textbf{LLOW}}}, or \textbf{R\textbf{ED}}. Give me a freakin break. THOSE ARE POLITICAL (not LITERAL) TERMS designed create general, cultural, social blocks to put people in. Who needs to be told that we are ALL shades of BROWN? Like, really??! And these are probably terms more accepted, understood, and propagted in the west - specifically in America - where our history and ethos and culture and society and institutions and laws and families and economies have been founded on these types of divisions. It is understood that WHITE people, around the globe are Europeans - period. It is understood that \textbf{BLACK} people around the globe are of \textbf{African} descent - period. It is understood that \textbf{Y\textbf{E\textbf{LLOW}}} people around the globe are East Asians - period. It is understood that \textbf{R\textbf{ED}} people around the globe are Native/Indigenous. It is understood that BROWN people around the globe are South Asians, I guess.... although brown identification is also a catchall/mutt identification as mixed \textbf{race} blacks, latinos, and Middle Eastern people all fall into that category, too. So now we can be clear that the actual color is a representation of a group of people and does not, necessarily, mean the color of the person. White people are known colloquially as \textbf{R\textbf{ED}} NECKS -  their skin is more pinkish/redish/orangey but we still call them "white." Back people range VASTLY in color from high \textbf{y\textbf{e\textbf{llow}}} to dark brown, but we still call ourselves "\textbf{black}" - and it's because these are convenient and easy ways to identify groups/regions/races/nations of people.

I have Asian friends who obsess about their eyelids and I'm just saying from a Western perspective which doesn't have a narrow definition of beauty, all shapes are attractive.

You're right though, it's difficult not to speak in generalizations in instances like this.
