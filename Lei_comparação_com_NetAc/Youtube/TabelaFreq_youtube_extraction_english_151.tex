  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I always find interesting how certain groups complaint about something that is normal to everyone and present it as a problem only for their particular group, presenting theories, and bringing new names and biased graphs that never consider all the facts and variables. This involves everything from social issues as feminism, \textbf{black} lives matter, white supremacist; to politics like democrats, republicans, left, right; in religion, cristians, muslims, judaism. In this case \textbf{ageism} is not a discrimination is something "normal" (in the real meaning of the words as the \textbf{common} thing) Ask any person over 40 if it is as easy for them to get a job at their \textbf{age} as it was when they were 20. Look to any professional sport player, do they complain that after 30 they are considering to retire? (yeah i know some have gone al the way to 60-70 but we all agree they were not in the top list anymore) No because they understand their bodies can't keep up to the young new talents. Ask youself if you were a company owner, do you want to hire older or younger people? Please I'm not saying older people suck, because they don't, older people with years of experience, knowledge and skill are a really valuable resource, just not in the places where the factor of being young is need. The only difference is people in hollywood or the top speakers of any particular group that comes with something like this have a "Voice or platform" because they are famous, or rich, or powerful or werever, people listen to them but ultimately they only care about their group, if they were really into "This is a society issue that need to change it", they will be in favor of all the groups and will recognize that there are many outside their circle who experience the same issues not only them, and they will work together to make a change for the benefit of all society not only their group.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Ageism, Black, Common & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Ethnicity - Black, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}4/333 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.201 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I think there should be less focus on \textbf{gender} and more focus on how \textbf{crazy} the top Hollywood actors paid list is.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small My buddy does work in Hollywood and says there is indeed a pay gap between men/women.  But he says it's a s game and due to the nature of men/women, rather than actual \textbf{sexism}.  This is how he explains it:Every other girl/\textbf{woman} is into acting, broadway, plays, etc.  They have a dream of becoming a famous actress.  This is \textbf{common}. They join drama in high school and take part in plays, go into drama in college, etc.  And after college, many move off to LA in hopes of being discovered.  Guys on the other hand are more rare.  Boys don't really grow up dreaming of being big-time actors for the most part, and of those that do, most of them are \textbf{g\textbf{ay}}.  They don't go into drama unless they want to get beat up/teased by the other boys, they don't go into drama in college...or straight guys don't anyway.  And fewer men run off to LA with dreams of being the next big star.  So, in Hollywood, you have far fewer male actors to choose from, and half of them are \textbf{g\textbf{ay}}.  In an actor, you generally want a guy who can be a \textbf{sex} symbol to some degree, because that brings in a female audience like no other.  So finding the right guy is going to be more difficult.  So there is just less of a supply of quality male actors out there to fit the mold of what Hollywood is wanting, so when they find them, they are going to have to pay them more.  On top of that, you have to consider that women will go out of their way to see a movie with a particular male lead, because a male \textbf{sex} symbol has some of his appeal tied to his name and status.  Many women will watch a movie that they hate, just so they can see a Ryan Reynolds or Bradley Cooper.  So Hollywood will pay these guys high dollar to bring them in.  Men on the other hand place little of their attraction on status.  In general, men don't go out of their way to see a movie just for a female lead.  Any attractive \textbf{woman} who can even act a little, will do as well as any other to attract a male audience.  And there are a lot of them available. The women who can attract a male audience purely by name, are rare, but those few who can, are paid an awful lot of money.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Common, Gay, Sex, Sexism, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General, Sexual Identity - General, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}9/415 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.169 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small With the Marvel Cinematic Universe it's pretty simple. If Scarlett Johansson (\textbf{Black} Widow) left it wouldn't be much of a deal. If Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man) left it would significantly impact not only the current movies being made but the coming movies for 5 years to come. And this has \textbf{nothing} to do with \textbf{sexism}. It's the same with Jeremy Renner (Hawkeye). They are all paid according to the importance to the brand.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Nothing, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/74 & \cellcolor{green!27}4.054 \\  \hline

Everybody wants their top specialists 30 with two degrees and 20 years of job experience (do ya math, pun intended)).My mother's husband is 50 and he's basicly out of labor market, except he can go make burgers in McDonalds, even having degree in radioengineering and stuff - he's too \textbf{old} for them and ohmyfkngod, he has issues with heart. So unless you're some VIP specialist or top-manager in the field, you're fucked.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Yes, a man playing the lead in a summer blockbuster expected to bring in 100s of millions of dollars SHOULD be paid more than a \textbf{woman} in a supporting role in a romantic comedy expected to bring in 10 times less.  I think the bigger question is, are writers creating roles (and producers paying for films to be made) where women have the opportunity to be the higher-paid lead?  And would audiences want to (and pay to) watch those movies, if they WERE made?  I think that's the true "front line" of this struggle: we still have yet to figure out how to reliably create top-grossing films with female protagonists.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/110 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.909 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small 8:45 Well, that's because most men tend to view their \textbf{sex} as completely, 100 normal, and don't blame everything that goes wrong for them on their \textbf{gender}. (Unless we're talking about MRAs and MGTOWs, who make everything about their \textbf{gender}.)If anything, I'd say men have it pretty lucky, since we're treated as normal, and as individuals, while women are constantly reduced to their \textbf{gender}, and viewed primarily as women rather than individuals. Correct me if I'm wrong, But isn't femaleness just normal if you're a \textbf{woman}, while men are the "other" \textbf{sex}? So don't women want to be treated as normal?

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I think that by \textbf{ageism} they're referring to the fact that roles tend to dry up when actresses get to a certain \textbf{age}, yet that doesn't really happen with men. It's not uncommon to see actors in their 40s playing opposite actresses in their 20s.Pay gap's bullshit though. As you say, Jennifer Lawrence got paid \$8 million more than Chris Pratt for "Passengers." Where was the feminist outrage? The fact is she got paid more for the same reasons that she got paid less than her co-stars in other movies. As of right now, she's more bankable than Chris Pratt. It's the same reason that Jim Carrey was paid 140 times more than Jeff Daniels for the original "\textbf{Dumb} and Dumber." At that time, Carrey had just been in two big hits‚Äî"Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" and "The Mask"‚Äîwhereas Daniels was basically scraping by as a D list character actor.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Ageism, Dumb & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}3/150 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.0 \\  \hline

Tilda Swinton wil still be a really interesting character for years, awhile lawrence will be eventually shadowed for a hotter young girl, you get what you signed for. The scarlet johansson effect, she is just way to hot, the movie under the skin is \textbf{weird}, kind of boring but still a really well done production and guess what, she HAD to do a full nude scene (actually a bunch of those), what a surprise.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small A fellow student tried to convince me Gillian Andersson was the victim of \textbf{sexism} in X-Files, making less than David Duchovny for several years. However, this fellow student mentioned herself that 20th Century Fox considered Mulder the main character and saw Scully as his sidekick. She framed this in a way that it sounded like a mere disguise for the studio to hide their \textbf{sexism}, and I believed her back then, chalking it up to "anecdotal (not systematic", but real examples of actual \textbf{sexism} in Hollywood".But actually, it's a perfectly legitimate point to say "you're gonna get less because you are not the main character". Duchovny always showed up first in the intro sequence, after all.Considering how the show developed over the years, you could definitely argue that Scully totally was a main character. Andersson had good support for this claim since the show did continue with her and without Mulder for two seasons and it worked just fine. But then, the bottom line is arguing about relevance of a role and contribution of an actor or actress to a specific film, not about their \textbf{gender}.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}4/188 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.128 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Robert Downey jr...¬†unpopular in the 80¬¥s, had a very few good movies in the 90¬¥s. very hated in the 00¬¥s and look at him now... One of the most respected actors in all Hollywood. \textbf{ageism} in Hollywood doesn't exist. RDJ is big in Marvel. 95 of Marvels actors is over 30. the cast for the teenage movie 'Spiderman' is the youngest in Marvel ever. Robert downey jr, 51. Chris Hemsworth, 33. Mark Ruffalo, 48, Chris Evans, 36, Scarlett Johansson, 32, Jeremy Renner, 46.Chris Pratt¬†should have been paid much more for Passengers, he spent more hours in¬†make-up, more time on set, had more screentime,¬†more lines and he had to show more skin then Lawrence. let me just say that in the¬†movie you see her character beat up Pratt's character, no one complained about that.¬†RDJ was one of the main persons for Marvel Studios existence. Of course he¬†earn more¬†because he's the reason the movie even¬†existed. Scarlett Johansson's¬†character,¬†\textbf{Black} Widow, isn't a main character, yet..¬†\textbf{Black} Widow and Hawkeye is the¬†"useless" part of the Avengers, but sure their characters can develop, which they have since the first Avengers movie.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small This is good, though I think you contradicted yourself a little bit when you said (and I'm paraphrasing here) "you can't make generalizations on people's income just by putting out figures of however many millions of dollars people made in a year," which is exactly what you did with Jennifer Aniston and Sandra Bullock and Meryl Streep and etc. Here's the key issue with \textbf{ageism} in Hollywood is getting "cast" in movies in an acting role. You don't know exactly what they did to earn those millions of dollars, I'm betting what is more likely to be the case is they were executive producer on a few films and that was the income they got from that. It would be a little hard to believe that they made that much money just from acting roles, though if that's the case then yeah, they really don't have any room to complain.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Ageism & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/150 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.667 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I agree. :-) They get paid by how many people actually want to see them in a movie, and what roles they can get. Actresses and actors should think of the future, and money money much as they can, until they get older.
