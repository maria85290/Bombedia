  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The way this video defines Millennial and Gen Z is not correct. Gen Y is not even a real generation but is considered a sub generation. Complete generations last around 20 years. To understand where the generations fit in you have to go back a few generations to the Baby Boomers. The most scientific definition of the Generations starts with the end of WW2 in 1945. When millions of soldiers came home from the war they immediately started families which produced a baby boom that lasted until 1965. The Baby Boom generation is called that because there was a literal 20 year baby boom after WW2 ended. The beginning dividing line between the Boomers and Gen-X is around the start of the Vietnam war draft. The start of the Vietnam war draft caused a *baby bust* in 1965 and officially ended the baby boom. People born in 1965 were not boomers because there was no more baby boom. Family size declined drastically from 4 or 5 kids per couple down to about 2.2 kids. The introduction "the pill" birth control and abortion from Roe v Wade in 1973 kept birth rates low into the 1980s. People born in 1965 do have something in \textbf{common} with those born in 1984. It is called low birth rates and smaller families.The dividing line between Gen-X and Millennial is around 1985. People born in 1985 and after cannot remember a time when the internet, computers, video games, cell phones, etc were not part of life. Millennials have a poor understanding of anything that happened in the 20th century. They cannot remember the USSR or the Berlin Wall falling or how big the cold war was for Gen-X and Boomers. Millennials are defined by 9/11 and growing up in the \textbf{age} of terrorism that came after. Generation Z or Post Millennials does not even start until 2004/5. The oldest Gen Z is only 14 years \textbf{old}.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Common, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}3/322 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.932 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small if you were born into a world with internet, you are GenZ. you were born during the boom of the information \textbf{age}. in this day, anything you want is online. you don't know a world without cell phones in everyone's pocket and a computer in nearly every house. when I was born in 95 is when computers were starting to reach into everyone's houses. my house got its first computer back then. everyone had landlines, you know, the phone that is connected to a wall XD and you found your friends by biking or walking down the road and seeing who was at each others house, or if you could see your friends bikes. now we are able to look at a digital screen and because the majority of the population have their own device now. the majority difference is "do you remember a time BEFORE our modern technology, our digitally saturated world. at the \textbf{age} of 16, it says its unlikely.but that's why \textbf{age} doesn't matter as much as the world you've experienced. being a mid 90's baby, I identify as Millennial but notice I carry a few Gen Z traits. I was only about 16 when I got my first cell phone and by this time smartphones were just starting to pick up wind. the iPod touches launch was when I really started to notice the availability of technology in our hands, my friends started to want to only text more and more. less people want to have a verbal phone call, and if there is a phone call, now we tend to attach a video call to it (skype Etc)\textbf{Age} doesn't matter, be your true self.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}4/281 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.423 \\  \hline

If you were too young to remember the things I mentioned in the first camp though, and were young enough to love post-2005 shows like Johnny Test for example, and considered them a fond childhood memory, you'd fit more into Gen Z.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}7/81 & \cellcolor{green!27}8.642 \\  \hline

I thought about mentioning 9/11 as a date for Gen Z and I think gen Z would be a post 9/11 generation because gen z  wouldn't remember when the USA wasn't involved in liberty distroying things such as TSA or the patriot act and Muslims were more of a curiosity to a person living in the states then someone that has some \textbf{racist} stereo types used on them and \textbf{terrorist} activities only happened over seas or in Hollywood films.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Old, Racist, Terrorist & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - General, Religious Identity - Muslim & \cellcolor{green!5}3/136 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.206 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I don't care what the Web says, Millennials should be two separate generations. Someone born in 1980 grew up in the 80's and 90s and was a adult by the 2000s. There experience of the early, mid, and late 2000s is radically different than someone born in 1994 or 1995 who where kids in the early 2000s and grew up throughout the mid and late 2000s. As someone born in the 1980s I can't even relate about cultural, life experiences, or especially growing up when I did with a 24 year \textbf{old}. As a kid I watched different shows, ate different cereal, played on different game consoles, used different mediums, listen to different music, wore different cloths, and had different presidents. Not to mention the world and technology was radically different when I was a teen in the 90s, versus people who where teens in 2010. We fundementally spent our time radically differently.The solution: Everyone born in the 1980s would be Gen Y, and everyone after is Millennials. Separate the two, like they should have been. Life for a kid in the 80s was radically different than life as a kid in the early 2000s - the Millennium (get it, little kids during the Millennium = Millenials)\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}1/208 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.481 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Attack of the Pixels There is a lot of validity in what you're saying.  I have seen many spans for Gen Y and Gen Z....people like you or me are closer to Gen X, as my older sibling is also Gen X. So if you had any older friends like I did growing up (2-4 years) we were heavily influenced by Gen X and the 80s and truly experienced the 90s.Most estimates I have seen for Millenials is 1980-1995, 1982-2000, 1980-1997. The most \textbf{common} one however is the first and leaves enough room for overlap. To your point, I have read somewhere describing us older Millennials nearing our 40s within the next 5-8 years as "Millenial Plus"....its a nice way of saying the older folk lol So  When people speak in general terms of attitudes of generation Y or millennials, they really taking into scope people born right in the middle between 1985 and 1995...to me those born in late 80s to mid 90s are the true millennials, and on average in scope and attitude people born in the 2000s are true Gen Z (those in high school currently and smart enough to not go to college). I'm def in agreement tho...can't talk to 75 of my own generation...sad to say, but I feel optimism from and because of Gen Z lol.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Common & \cellcolor{green!5}Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}1/223 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.448 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The Infographics Show. Well actually it's kinda the whole point. Also the fact that you think generations are important in anyway is the reason why we constantly go through cycles of recession and depression in America. Because instead of learning from our elders and our past we focus on the youth like a sickness. Youth is wasted on the young, instead of talking about what constitutes you as a human based on what year you were born, let's focus on the things our elders and ancestors learned throughout the ages instead of always relying on the youth to save the \textbf{old}.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Mumbʟes005 Yes! I used all of those in school. The only thing we had early on as far as computers go was the \textbf{Apple} IIe and I usually played learning games on those and of course Oregon Trail😀 We didn't get a computerized catalog until the late 90s. I wouldn't say the schools were behind for the most part, as one of my teachers had a Laserdisc player as well as VHS. Only one High school I had was out of date, as they still had actual chalkboards and we had to watch faded filmstrips. That was in 1998. Some say that Gen Y didn't start until 1984, while others say it started in 1982. I think the former, since I don't really have any traits of Gen Y. Born in '83, I felt like I was born in an era of 70s leftovers  and remember how life was before  the Internet.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Apple & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Native-American & \cellcolor{green!27}1/152 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.658 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Not exactly fair, I identify as Millennial yet I carry many traits of the "Genz" because i saw only the tail end of the pre internet life, i always felt more comfortable usinga keyboard to communicate once i began learning how, i immersed myself in the technology. I am an example of someone who breaks the "form" I am not Genx nor Gen Z i am a human who has seen both sides of the fence and continues to learn and evolve daily. the real difference will be in the children growing up right now, possibly a select few will even know what a library is. or will visit one in their life time. everything will be so easy to access online by the time they grow up, they wont want to go anywhere. this is a generalization and i am not a fortune teller... but this is what i see, the next generation will be the true technology generation. Mellenials pioneered the modern electronics, their children and some of them perfected it. now some of the "children" and the "childrens-children" (Gen Z and further) get to figure out what is next, Effeciency? sustainability?  genZ is entering the workforce and \textbf{age} of majority more and more every day, it is your turn to help shape our world. we need the creativity and ingenuity the mold breaking expansion of growth, we cant keep doing the same thing year in year out and not expect our planet to die one day from this toxic "modern \textbf{age}"\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/254 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.787 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small That fact you stated right there should tell you that, maybe, the whole topic you speaking of, is bullsh*t.The foundations of it, I would assume, are, in part, the deliniantions of the generations.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Generations in this sense don't exist. People are different and come from all walks of life, regardless of when they were born. Also, someone who's 23 today is a millenial according to dates, not Gen Z. A generation is a minimum of 20 years, with some being as long as 25 traditionally. It seems like people are so deadset on pidgeon-holeing millenials and disassociating from them that they are fine with confining a generation to a mere decade. I also don't really see any noticeable difference between the Gen Yers and Gen Zers around me; just these \textbf{weird} clickbait videos that reinforce division and groupthink. Finally, I find it funny that the traits being attributed to Gen Z in this video were the same thrust upon the millenials ten years ago.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Weird & \cellcolor{green!5}Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}1/131 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.763 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Beep Beep Imma Dragon not really not when your parents and grandparents are both boomers like mine, there is \textbf{nothing} strange about it demographic cohorts ie generations are traditionally defined by births taking place in a 15-20 year period, the way Gen Z and Alpha are defined are the outlyers very short periods of time if you ask me, and its because they're no longer applying the same rules and standards applied to previous generations and keep trying to apply this new logic to and in the process keep trying to redefine Millennials, they keep trying to make it more and more about "culture" instead of just ballparking and estimating actual biological generations, which would of course result in people 10-15 maybe 20 years apart from one another who could realistically have the same parents from the same previous generation(s). Sane logic would tell you 18-35 year olds are millennials and everyone who is 17 and under but isn't literally a baby born in the past 6 months to the past year are Gen Z thats would be a lot more accurate, that or something like 20-35 for millennials and anywhere from 5-20 years \textbf{old} for gen Z its best in my opinion and in keeping with the conventional wisdom of something that was never an exact science or for that matter really scientific at all to stick to 15-20 year timeframes\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nothing, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}2/232 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.862 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Novusod yes, but I would push the years back by five years. 1940 is the year after the depression ended, and by the time 1940 born people started kindergarten in 1945, World War II ended in 1945. The baby boom ended in 1959, so I see baby boomers as 1940-1959. 1960-1979 had the Vietnam War happening, and then plans to have the space missions begin. 1980 was when laptops and cell phones started being invented, and people began having home computers, and a few used the original internet like telnet and usenet. Then, there was the cold war as well, and also, the web became invented. 1999 were the last people who were \textbf{old} enough to be able to remember snippets of 9/11 as well as to start kindergarten before cell phones and home internet become \textbf{common} in the us in 2005/2006, which makes 2000 start gen z, cause they started kindergarten after that stuff became \textbf{common}.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@MegaAirplanelover Wifi was introduced in 98, like the internet was introduced in the 1970s to be fair.  With that meaning that the internet wasn't what could be considered mainstream until the mid-late 90s, and that wifi wasn't mainstream until the late 00s, and the introduction of smart phones.  Dialup was worth every penny, because that's all you had, and what existed, it was standard, and the internet was undoubtedly the most interesting \& fascinating introduction back then.Skipping ISDN which was only marginally better, when ADSL was introduced in the early 00s, it's most \textbf{common} speeds were 128 and 256 kbit/s maximum throughout the world, and it was incredibly expensive compared to dial-up, of course depending on how much you used the internet.  But yea no one except BBS operators with multiple lines, were ever blocking their entire phone line 24/7.Remember that dial-up was only charged by the time connected, and for the record the rates in 1997 in my country was the equivalent to 0.1\$ per minute.  As there weren't really much use except for actual information, the occasional midi tune, or graphics/image back then, a typical connected session would usually last less than 30 mins, and happen pretty uncommonly, since you were quickly taught to limit your use, by the next bill, in case you forgot to, or by screaming family members wanting to use the phone (since most houses only had a single shared phone line back then).\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Common & \cellcolor{green!27}Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}1/242 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.413 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Jooze Mane um, technically internet use wasnt \textbf{common} until 2003-2005 at least in the us, especially at home. Many people werent going to spend money for dialup cause they would either be charged by the minute or they would only be able to have a certain amount of hours per day, and if they exceeded those hours, they would be charged extra. If we are counting people of all ages, that means from birth onwards, 50 used the internet only around 2003 at the earliest. In the 1980s, there was this thing called usenet, which is similiar to the web, except that it was only meant for people to look up information, post articles and messages, and read the news. Internet began from 1969 after it evolved from arpanet.

Then, you wouldnt be able to use your landline for phone calls without disconnecting the internet connection cause until like 2004-2005, cell phones in the states werent \textbf{common} for many to have, so landlines were their only way of making phone calls.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Common & \cellcolor{green!27}Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}1/139 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.719 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Xristos Nc i see your point. However for 9/11, 1995-1999 were 2-6 during it, so it is possible anyone born during those years could remember it or have snippets of this year. A number people may not remember before the \textbf{age} of 5-10. I was born in 1997, and I have snippets of 1999, 2000, and 2001. In most countries, 1995 born people were in first grade when 9/11 happened. 1996 were in kindergarten. 1997-1999 may have been in preschool at that time. When the iphone came out in 2007, 1995 people were in middle school. 1996 may have been in middle school depending on the city they went to as some cities consider sixth grade as middle school. 1997-1999 were in third to fifth grade. I first knew about the iphone only when I was 12. Only when I was 8 did I first see a cell phone and the internet. It depends on the person. Many people born before 1995 could feel gen z too.

I remember my first time on a plane and that was summer of 99 like 2-3 months after I turned 2.

Yeah, in 1999, I sat on an aisle seat in the left side of the plane. I remember many other memories in 1999. I relate to many 95ers. 2000 onwards, I cant relate. Many 98 and 99 people are like you 95 and 96 born. I remember listening to two songs at home from a foreign film that came out in late 98, but we could only rent it in 99. Memories from \textbf{age} 2 until 5 are usually not vivid. Yes, and if you said 2.5 onwards, then, it would be possible for me to remember November 1999 onwards. Oh yes, I remember winter 1999 when I wanted to wear this traditional dress my dad was wearing, and only in January 2000, I got to finally wear one of my own for the first time.

Once you hit 24 months \textbf{old}, you are no longer a baby. 24 months-59 months of \textbf{age} can be considered as either preschooler or toddler. There are many two year olds who go to preschool. I will admit I first went to preschool when I was four but that was cause the preschool I went to didnt accept anyone under four. Vivid memories normally dont begin until \textbf{age} five. We were both toddlers in the 90s. There is no such thing as a semi-baby. Once you walk and talk properly, you are not a baby anymore.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I'm just barely Gen Z, born in 1993, at least that's what I like to think. I'm one of those awkward transitional generations whereas Millennials are, by my definition, a generation which were coming of \textbf{age} at the turn of the millennia, hence their name, and Generation Z are the following generation. Millennials coming of \textbf{age} at the turn of the millennia would primarily mean kids who were starting-finishing, or in other words in the process of puberty and adolescence at the year 2000, so Millennials would be people born between, say, the year 1980-1992.Wikipedia also loosely defines Millennials as the 9/11 generation, while defining Gen Z as the 2008 economic crash generation. Having little to no recollection about 9/11, meanwhile remembering AND EXPERIENCING economic downfall from my parents' situation clearly shows in which category I belong. Also from wikipedia: Most of Generation Z have used the Internet since a young \textbf{age} and are comfortable with technology and social media. Completely true in my case, though it's NOT true for every single person born in my year or the following nor prior years.Sorry for my little off script explanation between Gen Z and Millennials, I really don't like nor want to be put in the same generation as Millennials since my alignments are much closer to Gen Z.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/220 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.364 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I see a lot of people saying how Gen Z are the most depressed. I'd like to add on to that saying we're the generation that understands each other the most, the closest generation. We get each other. We share our problems through memes. Like I heard someone from the Try Guys say on a YouTubers React video, with certain meme trends like Sprite Cranberry or the Pikachu meme, we all have the same inside joke. I've made at least 3 friends irl just over VINES. We bonded over some stupid 4 second videos that were just so hilarious to us. We all understand each other and we think alike, for the most part. We're that generation after millennials that are going to have fix everything everyone else fucked up, and we all know that. We make jokes out of it for christ's sake! But this really is the most inclusive and empathetic generation. Most of us aren't \textbf{racist}, most of us aren't misogynistic, most of us aren't homophobic/transphobic. Because we've been so conditioned by making jokes over so many things that we're like "cool man, you do you". We stick by these oppressed people in our generation because we've bonded, consciously or not, over the internet, over social media, over MEMES. So yeah; most of us are depressed and numb from all the shit going on in the world, taking note day after day of all the stuff we need to clean up when we're adults. But we understand each other, we get each other, because really, we're all stuck in the same hole that we're eventually going to have to crawl out of.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/275 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.364 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Okay, that is nonsense.Millennials are not more tolerant. They are the leftist generation, and they're only "tolerant" of identical monolithic people. Millennials have, as a generation, gone to college for useless degrees and are now realizing that their socialist Utopia will not work. They eat up mainstream media and ask for seconds. They are workers, not entrepreneurs.Generation Z, on the other hand, is more moderate in its political alignment than its predecessor. A study of 50,000 Gen Z youth found them to be more than 30 more conservative than Millennials. Even the more liberal leaning ones tend to have disdain for Millennial PC culture. Gen Z is very entrepreneurial. More Gen Z earn income through unconventional routes than working standard jobs. We've found it to be more profitable, more enjoyable, and more intellectually stimulating. For instance, I have one online friend who just bought herself a car using money she made by purchasing worn clothes cheap and fixing them up to resell online. Not some trash car either. She earns over \$1000 weekly, and she works alone, just started a few months ago. I myself once worked at a grocery store... Idiot management. I found I made easily triple the money doing other things I really enjoy. I play the saxophone: I did jazz gigs. I am an athlete and my mother is a certified track official. I would help work at meets and get paid far more for doing something I enjoyed doing. Not that this is my career goal. I actually do intend to go to college, but only because I am seeking a Bachelor's in Political Science and a Master's in Law. I think our government is screwed up. I'd like to help fix that, before Millennials crush us with taxes to pay for their mistakes. Generation Z finds its information overwhelmingly from independent sources, which provide more objective reports and analysis. Gen Z is pro-equality, accepts homosexuality, etc. However, because Gen Z actually knows more about money than Millennials did at our \textbf{age}, and we actually WORK more than they did, we are more inclined to resist hiking taxes and relying on government to manage our income. Gen Z is younger than Millennials are, but Gen Z is objectively speaking more conscious of the real world and more prepared for their future. Millennials might be the first generation since the Depression to suffer a lower standard of living than their parents. Well, that's what happens when you go \$80k into debt for a useless degree and vote for people that bash capitalism. To learn from one's own mistake is intelligence.

We played nintendo, we drank out of the garden hose, we did not have strict "no-running" on the playground rule, no padding to oritect against falls and we DID NOT WIN PARTICIPATION TROPHIES. When we lost a ball game, we did not cry like babies, we toughened up and succeeded NEXT YEAR!! WE started our young adult-hood in the DIGITAL \textbf{AGE}. BUT.. it still took work.. we had to DIAL UP WITH AOL, we had long loading times, we did not have social media and log every moment if our lives online.. we did download musuc but through Napster PEER-TO PEER Programs.. and only the cool kids  who had to RESEARCH AND LEARN on our iwn to pirate music.. things were NOT HANDED TO US.

Very little money, so even though AOL \& PC's with Win95 was finally available to the public, not EVERY FAMILY had that JUST BECAUSE WELL..THE TECH WAS AVAILABLE.. so i also think that our 'station/class' has a major effect on the personality despite the GENERATION. While my uppity white friends had the brand new SEGA SATURN (which was the 1st to use disc games) I was still at home playing on my SuperNES and Carmen Sandiego on an Apple-Mac using DOS. There is a split between GENERATIONS and it also heavily depends on if the family is middle/upper class or straight up POOR. Us poorer kids were still stuck using oldertech. Let me state this again.. JUST BECAUSE it was "available" does not mean we had it in our homes.. this goes for the poor community. we could not afford the bew gadgets.* walkman instead of CD Player* NES instead of SEGA SATURN* Basic 13 ch with bunny ears not Cable/satelite TV* DOS instead of Windows95 (And if lucky enough to have Win95= NO internet or FREE NET-ZERO trials)* Pager\& payphone instead of Mobile phone.... get the idea?Still regardless of class, sonething were true ACROSS the board for all...99 did not have soft padding under the swings etc. It was dirt, there was no rule that you cant run or play tag..Theres was no "no child left behind bullshit" so if you couldnt keep up.. thats on YOU. There were no participation trophies yet. We were allowed to lose a ball game and cry.. but we kearned how to be a good sport, not a sore loser...When the streetlights came on.. it was time to go home!!Again, XENNIALS GREW UP in an ANALOGUE WORLD, and became ADULTS in the DIGITAL WORLD.

From 2000 to now I've had just 2 computers and 3 mobiles: the third one was used from 2005 to February 2018. Unless they break or not running anymore, I never go and replace them.- I still use my VCR and stereo set, and sincerely modern equipment are \textbf{nothing} compared to them. Otherwise I can't explain why the same EQ settings sound so bad on recent devices, while DVD movies aren't the same (comparing those I own on both formats).- Mp3. This is really controversial to me, but didn't get to the core of the issue till 2010, when I had to replace my broken portable CD player with an Mp3 player.Until then Mp3 was just the format I used for stocking music in my computer: when outside I had to bring CDs with me. The new player resolved many things, of course (much less space taken inside bags, no need to carry monstrous weights, flexibility, etc.), but destroyed for eternity a sacred thing: the first-ever listen of a record. Every time I go to my music shop and get a new album, I just can't listen to it immediately as I used to do in the past: have to wait to go back home and use my computer, with all of this routine often badly affecting the overall appreciation. I think I'll have to buy a new CD player and use it just on such an occasion!)What else to say, I try so hard to resist to the "robofication" of humans, but it's impossible to stop it!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}1/322 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.311 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Spondoolie I don't know which world you thought you lived in, but the actual reason why today people are such ‘pussies' over what you think chivalry and \textbf{racism} is, is because it was the normal thing in your time. It was acceptable to be \textbf{racist}, because mostly everyone was, and people wouldn't blame each other because they wanted to be included. And the whole chivalry thing you're talking about is kind of just bullshit. At the times where holding doors for women was ‘romantic' and ‘being a gentleman' it was also widely acknowledged that women were to thank you for holding doors. They felt obliged to. A lot of people of all minorities were opressed during that time, and the idea of the perfect world in your mind is just not being called out for the shit you say and do.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/141 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.418 \\  \hline

Some of this might not apply to specific millenials, but because you're in the generation, you're included in the general idea. And then general idea is exactly what he said. You're a participation generation. Here for a fun time not a long time. Millenials have \textbf{nothing} better to do because they can't afford real estate, so they just go full liberal and stopping ' hate' speeches while at the same time they preach rights of speech. If this doesn't apply to you, you shouldn't care. But you can't change a fact that the that's the general status quo. Most of republicans are religious. I'm not, it doesn't apply to me, but I'm just going to have to deal with it.Millenials are so weak. So so weak. They're sensitive to smallest and dumbest issues. Women's rights? You already have them, stop pulling the dumbest \textbf{race} cards at the dumbest times. Lmao. 2 years ago a Berkeley College, a bunch of \textbf{dumb} ass \textbf{colored} kids formed a protest to stop white people, and Asians, from entering the school. They protested \textbf{racism}, by being \textbf{racist}. I guess the Asian kids were too smart and realize how bullshit this campaign really was. Gen Z's protected due to so much dark humor online. We have financial stability from boomer parents, early access to technology and knowledge inaccessible to Mills. Only downfall is we're all pretty unhealthy, low attention span and we need glasses.

And also, just because they're teenagers doesn't mean that you can deny that they have real issues. That's what makes depression worse for so many people, being told that "they don't have it."

Fishing with my dad instead of a iPhone fishing game. Of course I'm the oldest possible ' Millennial' label in years so perhaps I'm not really one at all. When I was 16 we had just gotten a basic cell phone and it didn't have signal most the time. Girls had to to be contacted at home on parents land lane or pass hand written notes. I saw just enough of what the ' \textbf{old}' life was to know it was more fulfilling and real. Today why do anything when you can just play on your phone! It's destroying our society. I like tech don't get me wrong, but I use it to educate myself and enhance my knowledge. It's access to information you otherwise didn't have before without digging in a library for hours. My dad was a Marine Vietnam vet and my granddad a WW2 vet so perhaps I'm more of a baby boomer than a millennial despite being born 1984.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small This might be a long comment...I'm 12, and I feel like people give a basis on a person they meet, due to that person's \textbf{age}.  What I'm saying is that people regard you with stereotypes of stupidity and idiotic behavior, even just meeting you for the first time.  Sure, there are tons of 18 year \textbf{old} idiots out there, but you can't really put a label on how a group of people act.  I bet in the beginning of reading this, when you saw me listing myself off as a 12 year \textbf{old}, you would've probably thought what I was going to say was about Minecraft, Roblox, Fortnite or something \textbf{weird} like that.  I can say that many kids my \textbf{age} undoubtedly fit into the stereotype of young people that society chose, but the big thing that I'm saying is that there are smart and \textbf{dumb} people in each and every generation.  Now that I think about it, why do we even think that young people are \textbf{dumb}?  Aren't young people (such as millennials) more exposed and experienced to the future that's being created?  Aren't they smarter because new information has been created?  Is it just \textbf{old} people that hate millennials, because millennials don't act like their generation?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@andie We honestly seem to be the most depressed generation. I know the comment will get kinda long and numbers can be boring but the ones I quote do unterline my point: A study about the lifetime prevalence of depression in 2003 has shown that major depression disorders seem to set on much earlier in younger generations. The first time a statisticaly significant number of people are diagnosed with MDD usualy seems to be the \textbf{age} of 13, but how early how many people struggle with it is vastly different. For example 25 of the youngest generation in the statistic, the 18-29 year olds, have experienced at least one Major Depressive Episode in their lifetime. That's even a bit more than the 30-44 year olds, eventhough they have spend 15 years more alive. The most drastic difference is with the generation over 60 years. Only about 10 of them have had at least one MDE in their entire life.Eventhough a different generation is young now I doubt that the clear trend in that statistic has changed that much and that we are that much different.Something is wrong, and it seems to be linked to how drasticly our lifes today differ from the way humans developed basicly for the last 200.000 years. The world changes more quickly than every before and we just didn't have the time to learn how to deal with it.I think that our generation is probably the most loving and accepting and that is a good thing, but it's probably because so many people know from own experience or from people around them what it's like to struggle with \textbf{mental} health.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Mental & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}2/277 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.722 \\  \hline

This video was moreso statistical facts about Gen Z generation, and sometimes comparing it to a few statistics about Millenials.The reasoning behind a lot of Gen Z's statistics was detailed and sound, whereas explanation behind why Millenials thought and acted the way they did was extremely sparseAnother is quite simply \textbf{age} difference.Comparing a generation who are currently children to mid teens and their woldview to young adults to 30 year olds is a strange comparison when not put into perspective It would have been better to apply the comparison statistics of Millenials from when they were the same \textbf{age} that the majority of Gen Z are now, as they are collecting this data fromTalking about the differing social habits between two generations needs to include the social habitats i.e: highschool, or university, or even the workplace I think what's especially interesting that wasn't mentioned, is the polarising changes in attitude between the generations that clearly reflect where the desire for innovation and change grows and shifts with each implementation of previous desires for change. Attitudes that the previously newest generation craved yielded unforseen results of circumstances that the now even newer generation has their own desire to reform and improve onWorkspace relations for example. Open offices were seen as the innovative, cooperative and a more creatively driven work environment when Millenials were entering the workforce, as they were a stark contrast to the soul-crushing cubicle spaces that Boomers experienced Whilst they did come with benefits of being a more pleasant environment and easier to communicate, it did take away a modicum of privacy as well as increasing the rate of extra stimuli which could be distracting and hinder productivity Innovation is about improving on what we already have. Learning from changes and mistakes and adjusting to make things better. Many Millenials do prefer the shift back from such open office spaces after experiencing their drawbacks But that doesn't mean reverting back to the \textbf{old} style, but instead compromising With trial and error, each generation of the workforce will improve our view of the ideal work environment And whatever changes Gen Z favour, I'm sure the generation that comes after them with have their own say after witnessing the experience of such reforms, their benefits and drawbacks\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}3/439 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.683 \\  \hline

It is horrible! And our country has one of the highest rates of homeless youth in spite of our first world standing. We believe we need better border security for economic reasons so that we can care for the people in our country who need help. I understand people seek refuge here, but there's a process.

I do not hate feminists, I hate when people fight for \textbf{gender} superiority and automatically label all men trash or fight against things like Miss America competitions or Christmas songs when there are real issues like rape. I don't like that they use rape as an excuse to push a political agenda. Believe Ford when evidence was scanty, but dont speak about Ellisons wife, call her a liar with all the evidence in the world. That doesn't show me the left cares, that shows me the left uses issues of the heart to control voters and gain power. We love guns because we need them to protect ourselves if the government turns on us. Did you know the whole purpose of the NRA was to help slaves rebel and protect themselves? We do want health insurance, but are weary of government controlling it. You know it used to be \$5 just 20 or so years ago?? Why don't we focus on making health care and medication affordable again?? I don't have health care, I understand, but I don't trust the government to have that much power. Some people push their religion, because it's part of their religion to spread "the Word of the Lord". As a Catholic with my own religious philosophy, I understand the annoyance of people pushing beliefs down your throat. But this is America.

And I know he was supposedly quoted in people magazine to have said that in 1998, but it has since been disproven as a false meme since it never actually came out in the magazine. I don't remember a recording coming out, you say it was taken down.  So it is a he-said-she-said fact at this point. Either way, that was 20 years ago and I dont even believe the same things I believed 5 years ago, so I wouldnt hold him to that statement. The rich get taxed like crazy; personally, I feel like there should be a flat tax on income. I'm pretty sure the tax cuts were for businesses though.

For example the growth of mobile phones will have a huge effect on the differences between people born before the millennium and those born after. I notice people half my \textbf{age} who are so much more savvy with a phone because they've grown up with it, but whether those people are more likely to leave a bad review after a purchase or prefer working in groups or by themselves or prefer face to face meetings or emails and texts is entirely down to an individuals personality.The problem with generations is that people try so hard to squeeze as many correlations between differences in time, but most of the variables that influence who we are as a person, whether we're lazy, productive, clever, stupid, mean, or nice are completely subjective to our experiences and relationships we develop as we grow up, and not so much whether we had a phone when we were growing up.On the other hand wisdom and life experience are completely influenced by our \textbf{age} irrelevant of point in time, for example teenagers tend to lack empathy and have limited social skills and this can be described as anything from "Narcissism" to being "Independant" The truth is through out history 30 to 40 year olds have described younger generations as narcissistic with records going back to the 18th century, there are people who thought "young people read books for fun, books should be for learning" "Television will stop children appreciating the value of books" "Children play computers all day, they never watch television with their family anymore they're unsocial" "Children are glued to their mobiles these days they don't know how to take apart a computer anymore"...

Actually I am very proud of using proper grammar in my two native languages. In regards to English, you can be sure I put all my efforts to use the proper grammar as well. The fact I made a mistake (among many others in this text maybe), might be due English is not my native language and it will take time for me to develop my knowledge on it. And that's within my capabilities.In addition, I wouldn't say the inability to use proper grammar would make that person a "\textbf{dumb}", but the will to not use it. In example, you have proven that you can actually use the proper grammar, and you apparently know enough grammar rules to detect my mistakes and to correct them. Yet, you're \textbf{dumb} enough to not type the \textbf{dot} at the end of your sentence and \textbf{dumb} enough to type your name and surname in lowercase.Definitely not everyone in Z generation is \textbf{dumb}, but for what I can tell, you are.

I remember it led to America as a whole becoming terrified of terrorism similar to how we were terrified of communists through the cold war basically leading to Muslims being outcasted and harassed like you said even though in reality it's not that simple because there is such a thing as domestic terrorism. the main point being that since 9/11 our society has been living in fear and has never really recovered from the impact of that day, I was a 10 year \textbf{old} in 5th grade when I saw it happen and to this day its still horrifying for me to watch even though now I'm almost 30...\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}1/154 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.649 \\  \hline

Sure we did have internet back then but it was so slow that it would take like 5 to 10 minutes to load a web page and it took up the phone line so it was there but it wasn't so advanced that it would take over your life like what is so \textbf{common} today. Sure there was technology to make life easier but it wasn't so advanced that you couldn't live without it. At first when everything started going to hell in the early 2000s we were afraid at first but now its been getting worse for so long that its hard to remember what life was like before. It's just hard to remember that there was a time before all this started when the least of America's problems was war or a \textbf{terrorist} attack and more about the OJ Simpson chase or when Bill Clinton had a nice blowjob in the oval office.

I also try to learn about things that school can't teach me. I know people my \textbf{age} doing the same thing. Most of the time we will talk about problems in our world and what we should do to fix it even if we can't. I also use my phone to focus on things I need to do. I will play music when I have an anxiety attack, need to clean my room, or do homework. It helps me focus. I'm glad we have the internet. But it doesn't make school any easier.  Once again, stress and expectations from our families and teachers.Personally I don't like social media. I don't even use it often. I only have Instagram and that's so then I can keep in contact with my friends. And just talk with my internet friends if they got a problem. Kinda like a therapist but for free. I've been looked at by older people who think I'm just like any other rebellious teenager who loves being alone in their room, on my phone all day, listening to music. If I could go out I would. If I could hang out with my friends I would. Literally no one I talk to even likes hanging out with their family because everyone is so judgmental. Unlike us kids and teens who don't give a crap what someone wears, what their sexuality is, or what they like. I'd say most of us are very open-minded people.

Damn was it good. I also remember alot of the rap and rock I heard was from the late 90s and the biggest album I can remember at the time that was played over and over was 2001 by Dre.

I didn't know how life and society worked or had experience, I thought things were easier to solve than what they actually are or didn't care at all and I also had the Gen X telling me I didn't know jack shit and I took things for granted.

They believe the media opinions much more and therefore are likely to do things that are trending all for the experience.  They are growing  up in a culture that shames being judgmental and celebrates experimentation; yet societal law and culture is more staunch than ever (except in Chicago) in giving harsh punishments and life-lasting consequences. This is where gen z is most vulnerable because they lack the resources to learn the ability to judge right and wrong, safe and harmful, good and bad. <3's to gen z.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Crazy & \cellcolor{green!5}Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}1/157 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.637 \\  \hline

You cant cover every base in a youtube comment otherwise they would turn into essays.

Stereotypes are not invented for the sake of it, they have some basis in reality otherwise they would cease to be a stereotype. For example many \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} men are flamboyant, whilst its not true to say ALL \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} men are flamboyant i would understand someone making a generalisation. The original comment certainly rang true with me.As for your Japan example, if you asked a japanese guy "Are you a pervert?" Him answering no does not make it any more or less valid because he doesnt speak for every japanese person...just because he isnt does not make an overall stereotype true or false. If you could magically ask every citizen at the same time and get a truthful answer in some kind of poll then maybe so. You would be able to say with certainty if it was a minority/majority or a disproportionate amount that were perverts.So where have these millenial/gen x/gen z stereotypes come from if they are not based on any sort of evidence?If i said, all french people like to eat cheeseburgers...you would say im talking shit.If i said, all french people like to eat frogs legs and snails...would you not somewhat agree?\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gay & \cellcolor{green!5}Sexual Identity - General, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality & \cellcolor{green!5}4/278 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.439 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small No, they are not really conservative. They think they are conservative but they are neoliberal. There is a big difference between conservative and neoliberal. Many people think nowadays that the right-wings wave is a conservative wave. But that is untrue. It's a new neoliberal wave. It seems that you don't know what I mean. Read the book ''The Good Society'' and about the Mont Pelerin Society. This book is from Walter Lippmann. Lippmann is/was one of the most famous journalists and political commentators who promoted the social-economic (Neoliberalism) ideas of August von Hayek (he was economist) The neoliberal era is today predominant (since Ronald Reagan and after Keynes' Bretton Woods system ended. Hayek and his Chicagoer Boys advised the US-government at the beginning of 70's. And other countries like Pinochet's Chile, GB under Thatcher and many more). Neoliberalism has \textbf{nothing} to do with liberalism in social-way. Only in the economic-way. Hayek said once that we need 2-3 generations till the neoliberal idea will be accepted and lived. The Generation X and Generation Z are this generation. Especially Generation Z. They accept neoliberalism without resistance. Because they were indoctrinated from the beginning. They think they are free, strong and freethinkers. But they are not free, strong and freethinkers. They living in a neoliberal bubble with invisible chains and borders. The scene at 3:33 was the perfect example. The discussion between GenX and GenZ with the optimistic vision of GenZ. Whoever have always a optimistic vision cannot see the danger of the future, the danger of political acts and manipulating. They close their eyes because it does not directly affect them. They stopped thinking. It's \textbf{nothing} to have the best academic grades nowadays (btw with big debts) if they were educated with neoliberal ideas in school, college and university. Many Nazis had awesome academic grades and they did big crimes and looked away. Lippmann Hayek wrote something about the ''optimistic vision''. I don't remember were that was. But it was something like this: Whoever have only optimistic vision about himself and his future he doesn't look back and does not question anything like the social-economic way. He does not want to see the bad developments in their own society and the world because he thinks everything is ok or will be ok.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small To those defending baby boomers:Most of them generally have a terrible demeanor.

So, while baby boomers may be hard workers, they are typically in most cases assholes. Not to mention the stuff about the economy.Millennials are usually more intelligent too, because they've had access to one of the greatest inventions of all time (Internet) for most of their life.I've also recently heard that millennial divorce rates are lower than any other generation. Seems like they're better at relationships and communication too.All of this is a good thing though, because it means that humans are learning and progressing towards a better society than the ones of countries today.Notice how people call millennials (or Gen Z, I guess) stupid.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Mason 11  Your comment is the truest I've ever read. I'm kinda in the end of the Millennial Generation. I don't think I fit properly in either... but still.. I feel less hope for the newest generation because they see "Technology" and social media as the only way to accomplish ANYTHING and that's so not true. They are indeed "married" to their phones and think that life only exists off of that. Often thinking that because they have phones and info and "the world at their fingertips" that they are more mature, smarter and grown up at 13 than people who are \textbf{senior} to them and have actually lived through life and life lessons... It's sad. I also see no respect in GenZ... or at least not much of it. I don't wish myself into any generation, I just wish people were more humane to the people around them every day and that we could reinitiate times when we cared about our fellow man more thanwe care about how many "followers" we have.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Senior & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}1/173 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.578 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Aquaman Yes, I completely agree and admit that I am biased. I obviously have not met face-to-face or online all 2 billion Gen Z'ers. But from the sample I have encountered, especially online, 4 out of 5 did not result in the best experiences. (In person though I often have good ones with the borderline Gen Z'ers/millennials my \textbf{age} but not the adolescents). When you have a dislike, prejudice or displeasure of something - especially a specific group - it's gonna derive from some personal bias. And that's simply because you consistently experienced something that irritated or degraded you. So again I know my viewpoint on Gen Z is biased, but a negative viewpoint of anything will always have a bias to a certain extent.As for 'offense,' I didn't think anybody who has replied to me so far was offended. By triggered I meant that they were irritated to where it could not be ignored. So like when you for example labeled me as 'insufferable,' it seemed because you had to let it go from your chest, or else you'd stay tense knowing that I was an 'egotistical' person, according to your standpoint, and not getting to address me. Thus it comes off as butthurt to me. I do know that Gen Z is young of course and that they aren't really able to make world changes yet. But with the power of social media, I do have bleak expectations. And I know there are the exceptions to my opinions. While there are not as many Gen Z exceptions out of the total I've encountered, the majority of Gen Z could very well not satisfy everything I listed. Again the only way I'll know is by meeting every Gen Z. But from what I've seen as of now, it urges me to make those sweeping generalizations whether they're true on a larger scale or not.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/316 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.316 \\  \hline

We are a threat to their systems and a lot of millennials refuse to have kids because we feel like there will be \textbf{nothing} left for them as we feel for gen z. In general, Millennials are treated HORRIBLY when we enter the post-college-degree workforce. No one wants us because the economy is so bad and we are seen as a threat and shunned by our older co-workers.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Gen Z can NOT multitask. This multitasking myth is just an excuse for lack of commitment, poor attention and low comprehension. To prove it let them watch a film, read a chapter in a science book and write a poem with their smartphones switched on. Afterwards get them to read their poem and ask questions about the film and book. The poem will be weak and any memory of the film and book will be scattered and superficial. As adults these 'multitaskers' will constantly flit from job to job (if they can get one) but never become proficient at any of them, and from one shallow temporary relationship to another. They will have numerous passing interests and activities but never excel at anything. Their lives will pass in a haze of instant personal gratification, getting nowhere and contributing \textbf{nothing}. I dread to contemplate what generation of children they will raise.

There's a reason the oldest of Gen. Z are considered emerging adults and the youngest still attend middle school, i like many gen Y obviously was care free a decade about living in blissful adolescence semi if not completely dependent on my parents, but growing up means taking on responsibility and independence which also means taking on the weighted stress, less hanging out, and increased focus on creating a stable independent future.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Gups actually it's the opposite. Most millennials we're raised with the thought that they are special, they are owed success, and get congratulations for just showing up. So when gen y grew up they received a huge let down because they were unprepared to be challenged. Gen z has seen a decrease in that parenting style and as a result Gen z has a better work ethic and are more prepared to take on the world. Not to mention with the new technology constantly adapting Gen z has more options for work that no one thought of before.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Autumn WhittingtonNot really.  It was ingrained into millennial to go to college and you will be guaranteed a job.  This was taught to them ever since grade school.  The millennials jumped through the hooped that baby boomers told them to jump through.  When they came out, those job weren't their and that employers didn't value their employees like back in the day.  Millennials was pretty much brain washed to believe that is the way to obtain success.  However, there are multiple ways of success that don't involve a degree.  You can have be a real estate investor, start up a business, or set up software that gives you passive income.  The only reason why Gen Z has this understanding was because of their immersion into the internet \textbf{age} and learning from the screw ups of millennial.  Millennial didn't even have that close to the level of access or opportunities to use such technology.    Gen Z will be very successful since they also don't have to face a recession anytime sooner.

Instagram took what everybody liked about snapchat, which just the stories honestly. YouTube videos from popular channels are longer than they've ever been. When I was in middle school and YouTube started getting popular, they were \textbf{dumb} videos lasting maybe 5 minutes. Now they're generally around 30 min. And a lot of the time between 40 and an hour. And people enjoy longer content on the platform much more now. People in gen Z will listen to your to 2 hour long podcast or listen to a storytime youtuber for an hour. Not that I know for certain that this directly shows the attention span of a generation. Its much more complicated than that.

I pray for the future kids on mine, that they aren't influenced by the rappers and sluts that plague the minds of children through pop culture. Who knows, maybe when my generation realizes that their life was a waste of time, they will try to tell their kids not to do the same. Then again, these kids will probably be living in poverty, seeing that now single mothers are glorified by extreme feminists, and single mothers tend to be uneducated and thus poor. I mean, the devorce rate of parents has skyrocketed in the last 30 years due to stupid decisions in early relationships. Like, oh I dont know, premarital \textbf{sex}. But then the media says stupid lies like devorce doesn't effect the kids, or it's good for them to be independent. What the hell is wrong with these people. Obviously it has a bad effect on the kids! They don't have parents!!! God help mankind.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The dates aren't important. It's grosso-modo a new Generation each 20 years, but it doesn't imply each and everyone born before and after a certain date is part of a new Generation's values. This type of social analysis start around 1880 because that's when the second class emerged as a political power and the press starts to be written for, and talk about this second class. Why no 3rd class? Well, for a long time 3rd class wasn't voting. The poverty class remained illiterate for a good portion of the 20th Century, and apart for major strikes, didn't really have a platform to express itself like with current social medias. So for the main generations I just go by 20 years (time for a child to reach adulthood), the exact years are just not too important. Lost Generation (1880-1899), Grandiose Generation (1900-1919), Silent Generation (1920-1939), Baby Boomers (1940-1959), X Generation (1960-1979), Y Generation (Millenials) (1980-1999), and Z Generation (2000-2019). So yeah, these dates are \textbf{nothing} official but the official dates I don't think matter. You get the general idea by going every 20 years since 1880. Y Gen are micro Baby Boomers, focused on independant entreprenariat, expressive but quite undisciplined, lazy but inventive. Gen Z unfortunately (I think) might become a new Silent generation, disciplined but conservative. They will look for more stability and security because they have experienced the traumas of terrorism and school shootings the same way that Silent Generation endured WWII. They might be anti-violence and anti-guns but they might welcome back censorship. I am not sure if by "security" they will want to fight off internet surveillance which is a big issues since the mid 2000's, or instead opt for more surveillance, embrace Face ID and that sort of thing. It is still an influenceable generation as we speak. The individual Me, Myself, I aspect of Gen Z is similar to "selfie" Gen Y, but Gen Y is a lot about freedom, live (YOLO) and let live, while Gen Z might wish people kept more to themselves. Y Gen voted Democrates but are very divided, which is normal since they encourage "Express yourself", but Gen Z might be more one-sided toward more conservatives values and that's worrying. I mean: the 40's and 50's again? Please don't. By the way, I'm X. I'm biaised but I think the 1980's and 1990's rocked, and that's all us.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Generations aren't really based on the year you were born. That's just s rough estimate.

Then when the boomers (my parents) had their own kids, they became known as X (me!) who were the ones to discover the internet and the development of social media.... as we approached the Millenium the children of gen X became known as Millenials. Now the thing is that some people have children early in life, others have children much later in life, which is why there can be young Gen X with \textbf{old} Millenials who are close in \textbf{age}. Basically if your parents are Gen X then you're a Millenial. If you're the child of a Millenial then..... I guess your parents were really young when they had you?\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}2/169 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.183 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Well if you're going to compare two generations, at least compare them in the same \textbf{age}. The life of a teenager/student is a whole lot different than the life of someone who has been working for a couple of years and is trying to get their life started. Personally I had a whole different mindset 5 - 10 years ago than I have now. Also my view on the world has changed as well. As a teenager you tend to be very idealistic and you think life is going to be easy. That changes when you get older and have to face reality. I do not think this is something generation specific. Every generation changes when they get older. Neither do I think there is such a big difference between the two generations if you take \textbf{age} into account. I live in the same house with a couple of generation z'ers and I see a lot of similarities with my generation a couple of years ago. The last thing I'm going to say is not meant as a rant on generation z'ers, they are a great generation, but they still have a lot to learn and they are likely going to change as well when they grow older...

Hence, why alt-right is a movement of white millennials who were "forced" multiculturalism. As the economy improved, this generation also was able to obtain credit, loans, jobs, etc. Statistics should be used to compare this generation and millennials in this regard as a source of their optimism.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small A S: It's basically a fallacy that millennials are required to have "far more skills and qualifications" now, but I know what you're saying. It IS true that - with a glut of people in the job market - employers can lazily now simply require more things of applicants simply as a way of weeding people out and streamlining the hiring process. It's a horrible way to go about hiring the best person. Every one of them with any sense (there are still a few of those left. Nine, I think) knows that they'll have to train the person to do the job anyway. Still, it's easier to only interview nine people than 200. Your disbelief of what is required of entry level grads and millennials in general can likely be chalked up to a lack of perspective. Everyone wants to believe that they're the most brilliant generation yet, and that their struggles are unique and new. But my generation was also doing multiple jobs that the previous one hadn't had to do (as you now, millennials didn't exactly invent coding), and some of us even had to have the ability to do it without calculators or Wikipedia.You're not alone in this. I once volunteered at an after-school program and the other instructors - from the generation before mine - marveled at how smart the kids were just because they were so good at navigating the internet at such a young \textbf{age}. I decided to test that belief by hiding the big blue "e" from the desktops of all the computers. Only one sixth grader was able to figure out how to even get on the Internet. You do not get any credit for being proficient at things that were ubiquitous while you grew up. No one should marvel at the fact that I remember how to use a rotary dial telephone. It doesn't demonstrate any unique kind of cognitive talent. Conversely, I was taking an advanced physics class a few years ago and pretty much all the students in the class were millennials. It was truly baffling, the looks I received when we were asked a question and I chose to perform fairly rudimentary division in my head rather than reflexively reach for the calculator. This by no means makes me any more naturally brilliant than any of them. The problem involved a 4.5 and a 9, for God's sake. But I knew how to do something because I grew up at a time in which we had to be able to do it and we weren't allowed to have calculators handy until trig. I also observed in those classes that the younger students were interested only in having an answer to write down. So, in a lab in with teams rotated throughout various stations, people simply copied answers from previous groups. There was no interest in the process or in learning the "why," which is what we were allegedly there to learn. It was all simply about having an answer to present. The heck with learning.That's a huge difference in wiring that becomes amplified in the workplace where expectations are suddenly placed upon you. For awhile we pretty much embraced this influx of people who didn't seem capable of dressing themselves because they still had something of value to offer where the work was concerned. Then, as the demographics of the workplace changed, the employees still weren't of the type you'd want to introduce to polite company, but they also now were fairly useless, intellectually. The thing is, they still think they're part of Version 1.0 that was an asset to the business because they, too, grew up with iPhones and had ear gauges. We laugh at them and the general state of cluelessness that seems to permeate most of the important aspects of their existence, and they cry about the unfairness of it all.So, we talk about things having been dumbed down. We've had to scale back our expectations of hires for more than a decade now. As you gain more perspective, you will begin to notice that the standards YOU hold are being allowed to slide and that instead of addressing the problem to the benefit of everyone, your employer will essentially just shrug its shoulders and let you know that this is now the latest "new norm."God help us all when the day comes and the quick keys cease to work.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/740 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.135 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Aaron, I was born in 1983 and my \textbf{age} group gets lumped in with millennials but I think it's unfair to take the worst of any generation to label it.

Millennials are still pretty young and most people will grow up.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/62 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.613 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small MA: Problem is, they're taking a lot longer to "grow up". This is pretty much the case with each of the past few generations, but with the Millennials it's kind of gone beyond that tipping point. When you can be on your folks' insurance until you're 26, you've officially become an infantilized people. And rather than fight the labels as previous generations did, this one tends to spend much more time whining about it and taking no accountability.I never really knew what the Gen X stereotypes were. I'd heard the slacker thing, but I think the extent of that was people begrudgingly having to accept "casual Friday" at the office. It wasn't keeping us from getting degrees and entering the job market at the typical \textbf{age}. We also worked when we were in our teens and in college, which is something that's gone down precipitously with the generation that came after. I agree that broad brushes aren't the greatest, but it's ridiculous that everyone these days feels the need to say, "not every member of (insert large group identity) is like this." That this is actually put out there as an actual point - rather than being something all parties already accept and don't feel the need to mention - is another characteristic we can attribute to the easily offended nature of modern society, best characterized by the Millennials. We all know that not all members of a given group are identical. But that doesn't mean that the reputation a group garners isn't well-earned.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/255 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.392 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Aaron, I was 26 years \textbf{old} when that came into play and I missed out on being an adult on my parents health insurance. I notice the media will focus on the safe space millennial college kids that have too much free time but the media doesn't talk about many people in my generation that has been fighting in these wars, working the farm, working 3 jobs and going to college. My point is none of that is the sexy story, The media takes the most negative stereotype and runs with it.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}1/92 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.087 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small MA: Let's not forget the flip side. The safe-space millennials are the loudest voices, as are those on the political extremes, etc. Dog-bites-man is never sexy, but lets also not forget that we are seeing tangible results springing forth from all of this. The fact of the matter is that safe spaces, segregated student unions/graduations, etc., ARE now realities to the extent in which they never were with previous generations. Of course, the same idiots who made the ill-advised move of actually taking anything any of these children said as being worth serious consideration never change the playbook. They were more than happy to try to make a high school kid the voice of a movement against the Constitution. This speaks to another dynamic, which is that millennials also get to be the willing dupes behind which the American Left can hide. Put THEM out there with their limited perspective and understanding of a given issue so that THEY can draw the fire while those basically lighting that fuse sit back and pray to God that one of them gets hurt so it can further the cause. As for the rest, we all know the general ages involved in fighting wars, etc. What I think this comes down to is basically language. It's similar to how you'll occasionally get some asshole popping up on a comment board about the U.S. and pulling "Why do they call it 'America' when there is a North, Central and South America?" out of their ass. Technically, that's true. But in the way language is actually used, the entire world calls the U.S.A. "America."Similarly, when someone talks about a "millennial," they really don't mean those of that \textbf{age} in general (although they'll never actually make distinctions). The millennial is almost a sub-group of Gen Y that denotes the worst of the bunch, whether it be on campus or in the workplace. It's more like you have to fit the stereotype to be a millennial than the other way around. This is probably why people often refer to whiny Gen Zs in their late teens as millennials. Archetype rather than \textbf{age}. If I were you, I wouldn't sweat it. As with previous generations, just ignore that shit and do things right and no one will \textbf{lump} you in with the group.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The recession and War destroyed the millennial generation, which were considered the generation that was going to be admitted into college almost 100 rate, (this became true), meaning that it was foretold that this generation was going to be the most educated, the pioneers of science, democracy, education, etc. All of the good. What happens? This generation enters college, the recession happens and war does not end, all universities nationwide cut their research and programs, students get devalued education, taught only basics but not the essentials for industry and research. The recession left many of this generation without employment, living with parents, and hence losing competitiveness in employment despite their college degrees. Now, older generations are so ideologically brainwashed by idyllic America that they do not see the causes of why the millennial generation is the "loser", the despairing, and the \textbf{snowflake} generation.  Generation Z entered college with optimism because universities reinstated full curriculum and research, and hence their employability was better. Hence, why generation Z is optimistic and now will accomplish what their older siblings were prophesized to do. On top of that, generation Z were also hired right after high school in contrast to millennial generation, and hence why generation Z has the same mentality as the 50's idyllic Americana of individuality and right-wing economic policies. Generation Z will also be the most Right Wing, ultra-Nationalist, preservers of unrestrained Capitalism, and will also be the ideologues that will make Neo-liberalism the Law of Human Organization for centuries to come\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Snowflake & \cellcolor{green!27} Ideological and Political Identity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/251 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.398 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The problem is that Millennials experienced the Recession when they were in the working \textbf{age}. The high rate of unemployment in this generation and their high rate of college education meant that they lost work experience opportunity, meaning that they left college without work experience, and high student loan debt. On top of that, education lowered its standards as well, so college education became worthless and irrelevant, confirming the republican right's cynicism against academia and intellectualism. Hence why the term "\textbf{snowflake}" became prevalent by the Republican base because this term referred to students who were complaining of high student loan debt and unemployment during the Great recession and their complaints regarding the irrelevance of their college coursework (hence, the stereotypical "\textbf{gender} studies" or multicultural studies taught in universities). Losing work experience, even entry level, during working \textbf{age} may have consequences and show why a high rate of these students never worked until post-grad years and continue to be underemployed despite college education.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Gender, Snowflake & \cellcolor{green!5} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Age - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}4/162 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.469 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I really don't see how using apps and the internet makes an entire generation process information faster. This sounds like pseudo science and you give no real facts to back up anything ( saying "research shows" in not proof). Multitasking is basically impossible as shown in the Journal article "Division of attention: The single-channel hypothesis revisited"MRI scans show that when we attempt to do two things at once, our mind simply switches attention between the two. We focus on one task and then quickly refocus on a second task, but never successfuly perform both at the same time. The frontal lobe in our brain controls which act we prioritise, and our minds are unable to process two tasks simultaneously.As the word 'multitasking' was originally a computer science term that refers to machines, it's hardly surprising that this is beyond the grasp of human minds.Generation Z grew up with technology that millennials got to see become integrated into everyday life. Just going from a \textbf{black} and white gameboy pocket to modern console gaming blows my mind sometimes. It makes me think of how our great grandparents went from radio to television, and possibly even using the internet. Generation Z does not have stronger cognitive abilities, they just have more information at their fingertips then millenials did at their \textbf{age}. As many other people said, most of these people in Generation Z are still kids and have not experienced the real world yet. Give them about 10 years and see what "multitasking" and instagram followers will get them.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Black & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!27}2/259 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.772 \\  \hline

An entire generation raised up, many awarded for \textbf{nothing} more than showing up, taught that winning and losing don't matter, that it's someone else's job to defend you, that someone else is responsible for what you do - these things among many are responsible for what I believe is a generation lost.

My generation should have more credit as far as the diversity part. We are more integrated and more accepting of different people of different backgrounds and culture. (I'd like the point out that the whole trophy generation thing makes no sense.

Jeez it was one post ago;) jkSure some of the behaviour could definitely be explained by their young \textbf{age} and things like the ones you mentioned were definitely said before for previous generations. But to suggest their \textbf{age} is all there is and that generations and behaviours in the classroom don't change is silly. Just an example. In my parents and grandparents time the classroom was expected to be a quiet place and teachers had lots of authority to make that happen. In my generation students talked over/ignored teachers frequently. And in a few generation after mine even physical assaults along other bad behaviour on the teachers weren't uncommon and they had little to no authority to stop that. So things most definitely do change from generation to generation in the class room and elsewhere and it can't just be explained as an \textbf{age} thing.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small This is all stuff that has been researched before. The average attention span has dropped since the 00s. The newer generations are more demanding, they expect their services met now, immediate gratification. The reason older people complain more in your waiter/retail job face to face is cause they've developed the balls to demand the service they want with \textbf{age}. But be sure the younger generations are surely writing a very harsh review/rating on the service as soon as they get their hands on the nearest smartphone and are more likely to deny service from the same company in the future if anything doesn't suit them right (low brand loyalty, plenty of other options). Bet they are also thinking "Why do I have to wait here in line, isn't there an app I can use to order this food NOW" ;)Demanding, entitled and very uncompromising customers.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Germain Martel You're right, in general maturity correlates with \textbf{age}. I never said it didn't, I just said it's not always true (as in your case). Or do you think that a 25 year \textbf{old} \textbf{immigrant} w a kid and two jobs is less mature than a 35 yr \textbf{old} who went to college working in IT? It depends on the person right? I agree gen z is more spoiled than the millennials were but that's simply because as technology improves and the standard of living in the world (especially the first world) rises, prices go down and people generally are allowed better living environments to grow up in. This means that my children will be even more spoiled than I am. There's \textbf{nothing} wrong w this though. It pushes forth innovation until society reaches a point where they are perfectly comfortable w everything they have (we're obviously nowhere near that yet). Still, I find it supremely rude to look down on people, especially students who you teach, by calling them entitled and lazy when you don't even want to put in the effort to try and do your job properly. There's a reason your student's aren't listening to you and you should probably figure out why that is and fix it. If it's because our attention spans are shorter, which is VERY true btw, then try to find a way to keep them engaged. I have ADD on top of being gen z and I still managed to graduate w a high GPA in the IB program and got into a chemical engineering program that was 3rd in the country. That was thanks to my amazing teachers that created a competitive atmosphere which allowed me to excel (also my parents and myself but that's beside the point). Lastly, I actually find that offline (bc we tend to become quite brutal online no matter who it is) gen z holds gen x and baby boomers in pretty high regard. We respect that they worked hard and achieved. The only generation we really look down on is millennials because they're too idealistic and complain about everything 'holding them back', but aren't willing to change their situations to find a better outcome.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small As a Gen Z kid (2001), I have had access to tech my whole life, but I wasn't really born into it. First few years of my life were spent on the floor with toy cars, and I didn't really get into computers or any of that until I was 10. Granted however, I did get my first phone around the \textbf{age} of 12, but as I was living abroad it was only for texting or calling people, which for me just meant parents. I got heavily into learning how to use computers efficiently when I was at the same \textbf{age}. This is because where I was going to school, we all got to use MacBooks for a majority of our projects. Anyhow, a few other things are that I find a lot of people around my \textbf{age} to be kinda ignorant or stupidly immature, but I'm finding that's less the case this year. This is in part because I've been able to travel a bit, which has in turn gotten me to be a little more on the adventurist side.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Hi Mai Le, thank you for your kind words :). Ironically, I did Chemistry at University because of my undying love and passion for it lol (hi five for loving such an amazing science!). However, after graduating, I realised that the job market for it in my country is stagnated (something the college fairs don't tell you). Just a little advice, if you want to do Chemistry, try to do an application of it (environmental, food, material etc.) so if you want a job after graduating, it will be easier to be absorbed into a company that requires an Environmental, Food, Material Chemist etc. Additionally, you can also take that knowledge and develop your very own products that you can sell. Another thing Mai Le, if you can acquire other skills (trades) along the way such as plumbing, auto mechanics, tiling, electricals, woodworking, baking, hairdressing etc then these skills would become an asset when you get older (you can do something you love (apart from chemistry) on the side). Furthermore, even if you LOVE the sciences, having a minor or certificate in a business subject is also a good idea, it makes you more marketable, all rounded and makes you stand out from the rest in your resume (I did a Major in Chemistry with Minors in Analytical Chemistry and Entrepreneurship). I have a lot more "adulting" information that I wished I knew when I was your \textbf{age}, so feel free to ask :)\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/244 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.41 \\  \hline

It's almost impossible to post any opinion on the web at this point with no unreasonable conflicts, and your writing style has completely outdone that fact. Congrats to you for that. Anyways, I'll speak for the majority of Gen Z and say that by a very young \textbf{age}, (myself being only 13,) we come to realize how society really runs. We replace all of the 'happy' even fictional thoughts we had about what the world was like, and not only realize the true environment we're living in, but those we don't live in as well. We take what we do own for granted, and after it's eventually gone we're filled with regret. We understand we won't change the world ourselves, and therefore are building the path to step forward and rebuild this competitive, 'each man for themselves' mind-setted community. We are beginning the start of a new society, one of which takes people to work together, rather against each other, to grow. Technology has solely helped with this, as the connections online are much easier to all since there are no doubts or fears of being judged or blamed. It's the virtual world the Millennials set up, to assist Gen Z to set up this world in reality. I'm almost positive technology and the world itself will see a major positive increase in the near future, as we are all subconsciously working together to form a sub-Utopia. Heaven on Earth isn't possible, but we dream to set it up for future generations to build the next closest thing. Although we may focus on the majority of things previous generations did, the slight life 'fraction' that we differ from our predecessors in our life 'whole' can form a ‘whole' new future. By ourselves, our small fractions don't effect the total. Together, the pieces connect and rebuild the total. Replace it with a newer, polished version. If you chose to read this entire thing, thank you for listening to me blab about what I think Gen Z will accomplish through the help of the Millennials, and what we will do by helping the next generation.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/365 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.274 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Hi Hannah, thank you for replying. While I was at University, I did Chemistry because I loved \textbf{nothing} in this world more than that... However, there were some questionable degrees and Masters programs as well (Watershed Management, Biophysics, Carnival Studies, Mass Communications etc).... The Universities marketed the life out of them and promised the potential students a life of grandeur if they choose to do these degrees. The older generations (the heads of these programs) are the ones responsible for putting these degrees out like bait and to make it worse, the college fairs advised you to do it because they found 98 of their past students graduated and found jobs in the best companies or started their own venture with the degree. Oh yeah right!!! Poor ting scratching at home unemployed! You're right about the Biochemistry, I have friends who did Biochemistry as well and ended up working small, odd jobs to make money, the degree landed them nowhere. After getting my degree, I realized it wasn't all that unique because 150 students just came out with a Chemistry degree just like me and we would all be part of the \textbf{race} looking for jobs. After getting my BSc, I stopped right there and wanted to use it and apply it to something useful and in demand (like food). My other friends choose to do their Masters and PhD's as they thought it would make them more employable (college fairs pushing the agenda). Obviously, after graduating with your Masters or PhD, you enter the realm of being "overqualified" and your in the same boat with a BSc degree holder.  Hannah, you've hit the nail on the head, you are so right, you have to be realistic and think outside of the box, think about what you're buying into (the commitment to a school/job) and how it's marketed to you. Be realistic!

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I am Gen Z (born in '99) and I've known that I wanted to study Biology since I was 12. I've always loved the subject, but it didn't become a true passion for me until around 7th grade. I never was interested in going a pre-med route (but I thought about it). So I spent high school going back and forth between research and engineering. I did the research and determined that it would not be a smart decision for me to go the research route. I would have to spend a lot more time in school and I would be stuck paying for graduate school by myself. Considering these factors, I decided to study Biosystems Engineering. With this degree, I can get sucked into medicine, food, environmental, sustainability, and agriculture and do things as the research route. A lot of employers will pay for you to go to graduate school. I've also done extensive research in starting salaries for BE majors that graduated from my school. On average, they make \$61,000 upon graduating and have a 97 job placement rate. So suck it up, move back in with mom for a year or two, and save all my money. (She has 0 issues with this.) There goes my debt.  I've also figured out how I will pay for school. (Not completely, but if my plan goes all well then I will be between \$10,000-20,000 in debt.) My main concern is finishing my engineering degree in 4 years because its very \textbf{common} not to.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I feel this wasn't written by a Millenial or a Gen Zed... As a Millenial with younger siblings, knowing their friends and all that... I would say we are more or less the same only some differences due to maturity. Even though they didn't grow up without technology and missed out on a lot of things my childhood had, they still enjoy the outdoors and learn to put down their devices on their own...still, much more sedentary. Overall, they are calmer than my peers but definetly not happier. My advice to them is to stack up on skills, especially internet/technology related skills, or creative-thinking skills, but they don't need that advice, they know. What they do need is more emotional support, relationship guidance etc... I feel Millenials should be more understanding of that need, however, we have this bitterness at being "the generation" that switched from our childhood memories of playing outdoors and climbing in trees to the tech savvy and obsessed and everything is our fault somehow. I often hear Millenials even denying that they are Millenials.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The difference is simple, millennials are decadent and bloated fools who cannot handle reality. They grew up during a very interesting moment in history, the 80s saw the collapse of the USSR and the end of the Cold War, as well as the rapid advancement of technology. Those who grew up in these times knew only peace and prosperity, they believed that they could do or be anything, that technology was the cure for all ails. They believe that you can live life in the moment, without considering either the past or the future. Once the 2000s hit, everything they believed was debunked. The truth is that you cannot be whatever you want, that technology can be harmful, and that peace is a sham. Generation Z is different. We grew up in the \textbf{age} of global terrorism, economic collapse, civil war, mass shootings, migration crisis, \textbf{ethnic} conflict and endless foreign intervention. We understand that peace is only momentary, that technology is an opiate and that life isn't fair. We understand that unearned tolerance is cowardice. We understand that the world is unpredictable, and that be must plan for whatever prosperity or hardships may lie ahead of us. We also learn from the failure that is millennials. We understand that idealism is destructive, the millennials are the example of this.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Yes, you did grow up in a time of peace and prosperity. Your childhood was mostly completed by the time 9/11 happened. Teenaged years leave very different impressions on people. I was only 3 when 9/11 happened. When I was 9 the housing market crashed, and was 10 when we almost lost our house, and 11 when my family declared bankruptcy. My teenaged years consisted of seeing European nations go bankrupt, and the total collapse of the middle east, which led to its impoverished citizens flooding into europe. I saw kids my \textbf{age} being massacred by psychopaths and foreign terrorists. I watched Europe be rocked by suicide bombers, stabbings and mass shootings, some killing hundreds of people. I watched a mans legs be taken off by a bomb in Boston. To put it simply, both my childhood and teenaged years were set in a natural world (natural order being conflict). You lucky (or unlucky) to have already been a grown adult during these times. Do I find these acts morally depraved? Absolutely. Do I cry? Absolutely not. Conflict is the natural order, and only through conflict and struggle. Hard times create strong men. Strong men create good times. Just ask my older brother (who is actually a millennial). He grew up in abject poverty, sometimes not eating for days. This taught him to cherish moments of prosperity, and to always plan for the future.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The critique I have of this video is that I felt like the entire video was talking more about gen z rather than actually comparing gen y and gen z. You talked solely about gen z and then threw in a couple thoughts about how gen y is pessimistic because we're working so hard to still be poor and worried about student loans... Which is very true!! LolLike you stated in the video, the biggest difference between gen y and gen z is that gen y can remember a time before a phone was glued to your palm and everyone was so connected online through social media. It's \textbf{weird} to imagine the times my parents talk about when they would call people to catch up and find out what they did after high school/the last time they saw them... \textbf{nobody} questions what anybody is doing anymore because we broadcast our lives everywhere. This is why I deleted social media! I realized how much I disliked being so connected all of the time... it's overwhelming to me because I couldn't find a middle ground between actually living my life/being in tune with my own thoughts and paying attention to all the outside noise on social media and comparing my own life to what everyone else was doing with their lives. On social media people tend to only post their golden moments which causes you to become disconnected with the human experience. Social media gives a false perception of what everyone else's life is like and you begin to think you're the only one struggling. (At least in my experience). I became disconnected with reality in some ways! Also, I noticed how much I didn't care about taking pictures and videos of everything once I deleted social media.. I realized half the time I took a picture was solely to post it... which I didn't even realize I was doing until I deleted social media. I would get an urge to take out my phone and take a picture of something, it was like a reflex... 'Oh I gotta let everyone know I went to the park today! I gotta get a good picture.. oh wait never mind'. Lol. I realized how much I actually enjoy things now because my mind is completely present in whatever I'm doing. I am much more connected with reality now because instead of focusing on the need to update people, I'm just living. :)Cheers everyone✌🏼\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nobody, Weird & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}2/411 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.487 \\  \hline

I am definitely a minority, at least among my \textbf{age} group. Although I feel out of the loop sometimes, I would never go back to being so engulfed in social media outlets. It was almost like an addiction honestly, but I got so fed up that quitting the last time was not as tough as my other attempts. Although I feel out of the loop sometimes I enjoy that because all through high school and my first few years of college I was so connected and it was seriously affecting my mentality. I always thought i 'didn't have time' to read the books I wanted to, to just sit and be still, but since I deleted the accounts I found I have a lot of time to do those things, I just used to stare at a screen a majority of the time.

The majority of Generation Y are the youngest children of the baby boomers (just like myself), our older siblings are Generation X, the generation after us Gen: Y is the Millennials (being the children of Gen X) and now the youngest generation is Gen Z. Also the majority of the technological advancements came from us Gen Y with a investments from Gen X. Like....Im getting sick of society trying to fuse Gen Y and Millennials together. Us Gen Y's vote, work hard as hell,  are purchasing our first houses, creating and sustaining our own business, etc. We are separate generations that show \textbf{ZERO} likeness to the Millennials.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I'm curious as to why are there so many different \textbf{age} categorizations for Millennials and Gen Z. I was born in ‘96 and the category that I always understood myself to be in was millennial. I guess a 'young' millennial and older millennial being in their early 30s.  Given the information in this video, I disagree with the \textbf{age} grouping as everything that was stated in the millennial end of things is more familiar in terms of experiences between my peers and I. For instance one big one being college debt and another being the actually watching technology and social progress and actually being part of that progress, rather than being born into it necessarily.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/115 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.739 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Erik Nomura  My year is on a cusp I guess. Some sources stating Millennials are ranging from the 80s as the starting \textbf{age} (older Millennials), to the mid 90s (younger Millennials). Part of the mid 90s to the 2000s begins to make up Z.I'm 22. So like the channel commented, different sources group the ages differently and it keeps changing since political and economic factors are used as markers.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/70 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.429 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Everyone in my generation feels so entitled these days.  Really can't stand it... We're also living in an \textbf{age} where people don't think for themselves anymore, for instance, Gen Z generally just consumes the mainstream media and accepts whatever they hear as true.  My parents taught me right, and I know some good people from generation Z, but the vast majority of us is made up of narcissistic, uninterested, entitled brats to be honest.  Oh well..

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Caelum Blanco really? My parents are quite right leaning and I turned out to be a feminist- same with most people I know ( seriously most people in my school reject what they've been told all their life that's wrong and recognise that mainstream media often leaves out what they don't want you to know (eg the numerous crimes against \textbf{black} people in the us). As for entitled, I feel like most of us just want to keep our rights and not have to fight and suffer in wars \textbf{old} white men thought up for us- and we want to stop the conflicts going on now.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!27}2/106 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.887 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Noelle Nunes I still believe there's a kind of buy-in to a certain agenda, especially the more Left of center ideas that the younger generation gets into.  Just a question, why do you say "\textbf{old} white men?" and why does it matter that they're white?  Personally, I think everyone needs to get over \textbf{race} these days and stop caring about skin color and start viewing everyone as an individual.  That's truly freeing in my opinion, it's the kind of thinking that gave blacks freedom!  As a pretty hardcore conservative, I think it's misinterpreted that we hate women and want to praise men. That's not the case; A lot of us are actually first wave feminists.  We want EQUAL rights for women, we don't want to project them higher than men, praise them exclusively, and stuff that the third wave feminists are doing.  Happy to be able to freely discuss this with you! :)\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Old, Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/153 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.307 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Caelum Blanco I say \textbf{old} white men  because they are generally the people in charge. I also feel it to be necessary to mention \textbf{race}, because as a person of colour, I feel that \textbf{racism} can only be solved  if people realise and accept their privileges and disadvantages, so not seeing colour is not an option. I'm not going to say I have a deep understanding of segregation since I am not \textbf{black} or American, but from what I understand it was ended by \textbf{black} people raising issues and campaigning for them to be ended. As for feminism, all we're asking for is for easy access to things like birth control and to not be hindered and shamed when having an abortion, to not be victim blamed when raped, to not be harassed in the streets and workplace, and to have equal pay. First wave and second wave feminism did \textbf{nothing} for women of colour and LGBTQ women; it only helped white women. Third wave feminism is about including all women and tackling larger scale issues in countries and smaller scale issues in communities\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Nothing, Old, Race, Racism & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s, Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}6/184 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.261 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Noelle Nunes So then you don't believe all men and women were created equal?  You believe there's some inherent disadvantage to certain people because of their color or \textbf{race} but I don't think that's the case.  I don't think blacks are at a disadvantage because of their skin color, but rather there's a culture within their \textbf{race} that might put them at a disadvantage should they adopt it.  Either way, it's certainly NOT due to their skin color, rather, a culture that exists among them.  That's what's so great about America, we don't care about your skin color, we care about how successful you want to be.  This isn't the case in many other countries.  And last I heard, a \textbf{woman} who works as hard as a man, in the same field, will get payed the same amount.  The wage gap has been debunked long ago because it doesn't take into account the specific job occupations, hours worked, and workplace environments.  Women tend to take different jobs than men, work different hours than men, and take different priorities than men.  This results in the so called "pay gap" where women get payed less. That's simply because they're working different jobs and working different hours. They're all payed accordingly to the jobs they do have, I promise you that.  Moving on... I find modern feminism very paradoxical because it says A) Women are equal to man B) Therefore there's \textbf{nothing} wrong with hitting a \textbf{woman} C) It calls a hit \textbf{woman} a victim and it "attacks" the person for hitting a \textbf{woman} (Which I believe men shouldn't do anyway). That's just one example, and it applies to a lot of other things in feminism.  Feminism has feminized men, made us less protective over women, and raised men who don't have good ethics and end up harassing and raping women.. it's  a little ironic you see.  I think men should protect women, be nice to them, be chivalrous... It doesn't mean women have to yield  their pride, it's just a nice courtesy (I mean when you give a cash tip to your server, it isn't calling them weak and saying they NEED the money, you're just being nice.)  The fact is, ALL women can vote now, and that's a good thing.  :)\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nothing, Race, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}7/380 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.842 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I never said men and women were not created equal- we should be but we aren't- same with being a poc. If I were a cishet white man i would be much luckier than i am now, a bi \textbf{Indian} \textbf{woman}. I should be equal, but unfortunately I am not (cos thanks colonialism)! I can't talk for an entire community, but from what I've seen \textbf{black} people in America are definitely discriminated against in America- racial profiling and police brutality are a real problem. Unarmed people are being shot up just because they're \textbf{black}. If I went to America right now, I could be called a \textbf{terrorist} simply due to my skin colour. My Muslim friends would be harassed and discriminated against. There are a disproportionate number of white men in higher level fields due to \textbf{sexism} and \textbf{racism}. In poc dominated places there is less funding going into school, and for both women and poc, they are discouraged from working there- how often have you heard that something is a 'man's job'? Probably not a lot, considering you are male. But when women take different hours it's often due to them having to take care of the kids. Men should also take responsibility for their children if they are complaining about women working different hours. There is still a pay gap even if a \textbf{woman} works the same as men- in the US, it's \$0.77 to a man's dollar. In regards to your view on modern feminism, we're saying \textbf{nobody} should be hit. Anyone who's hit is the victim. Modern feminism also stands up for male victims of rape. There is also no need to be protective over women- I really don't need you to protect me. More men have raped women before modern feminism was a thing, and modern feminism has brought it to light, therefore making it more visible and reducing it. What does feminising men even mean? Does it mean men are now wearing more 'girly' stuff? Because makeup is literally different pigments being smeared across your skin and skirts and dresses are pieces of cloth- they have no \textbf{gender}. Is it to do with men liking men?Instead of only men protecting women, we should all protect each other. Saying that is very reductive. And yes, it's good that we can all vote now, but that doesn't change the fact that as a \textbf{woman}, I am still less advantaged than a man. I should be, but men and women are not truly equal yet.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Gender, Indian, Nobody, Racism, Sexism, Terrorist, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Ethnicity - Native-American, Gender - General, Religious Identity - Muslim & \cellcolor{green!27}11/419 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.625 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Ilan Kutsman THANK YOU!!! Gen Y and the Millennial Generation are 2 separate generations! They're trying to make a 20 year span into 1 generation (even though a generation is usually 10-12yrs). I'm 31, born 1987. I'm a Gen Y baby. Both of my parents are baby boomers, I'm the youngest child out of my parents, my siblings are Gen X, my nieces and nephews are Millennials and my youngest nieces and nephews (3yo-15yo) are Gen Z. Literally EVERYONE that I know who is in my \textbf{age} group  (28-36) are the youngest children of baby boomer parents. In no way shape or form am I or those people Millennials. Our mentality, our work ethics, or technological understandings our education and just our entire upbringing are drastically different. WE don't keep our hands out waiting for a handout,  we work for what we have, we're buying our houses now (Millennials can't even afford to pay rent for an apartment), we have a full time job while having our OWN business as secondary job if it isn't already our primary. I usually don't nit pick over stuff like this, but even last night we got into a huge argument at work over this...seriously. Roughly 9 of us who are between 28 \& 36 we're telling about 6 maybe 7 of our coworkers (lazy fucks) who are ALL 22-25 that they are Millennials and that they aren't part of our same generational group. We're Gen Y. Even if you look up Generation Y it stops roughly around 1993 but even googling it, it'll say that some sources will merge the "Millennial Generation" with the Y Generation. If anyone realizes Millenial means 1,000 years, thus for us that would've been the Year 2,000. I was in 6th grade during the whole Y2K fiasco, 90 of those Millennials weren't even born or were still having their diapers changed. Ask a millennial what was their starting wage at their first job...mine was \$5.50 prhr at \textbf{age} 15 with a workers permit. How do you take almost 20 years and literally try and forge them into one year. Shit, even my Principles of Business Management 301 text book for my MBA, VIVIDLY states that Millennials and Gen Y's ("The Forgotten Generation) are 2 entirely different generations, with completely separate spending habits, ideals and executions on savings and investments and understandings of banking and commerce. Growing up, I was ALWAYS taught and referenced to as a "Gen Y" kid, a little after my second nephew was born (I'm 14 at that time) I start hearing his generation being called Millennials. Now in 2018, him and I both are Millennials and they're trying to give them the title of Gen Y. Look it up, Gen Y is actually called "The Forgotten generation"....why would they call us that, if we're Millennials? Thanks for actually understanding!  Your comment made me happy that someone(s) else also understood this.

At a certain point any person will "give up" on new technologies, throw up their hands with "I don't understand these new things" and this is what cements you to be a part of the previous "generation" the difference between a Gen Y and a Gen Z is if the Gen Y person is at the state of "I'm comfortable using my texting, who needs snapchats or discord"But I know Gen X (like legitimate older people not people on the edge like me) that are even more described by your stereotype of Gen Z than actual kids born into Gen Z.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}2/254 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.787 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small As a millennial, this is how I see the differences between us and Gen Z. Millennials are the disillusioned and fatalist generation. We were raised in a time of hope and given instructions how to reach that dream, then when we did the things, everything collapsed. We were called entitled and should be grateful to have any job, so we did. We took on 2-3 jobs just to scrap by. We banded together, shared what we had, and accepted that everything was fleeting, so try to find small joys in the moment. Which is why we're apparently killing every market out there. We're patient and understanding, because we look at the person across from us and see ourselves-- sure that the waiter, the cashier, the uber driver, etc aren't where they expected to be either.Gen Z, however, was born in this shit storm, so I see them as the realist generation. They look at how things are and know if they don't do anything, the shit storm is only going to get worse. They're more tolerant of what makes everyone different, supportive of new ideas no mater where they come from, and give a big "fuck you" to anyone that tells them they're too young to do/know anything about the real world. They look at the raging debt millennials run around with, see how well the "normal" route worked for us, so look at a new path for solutions. They're accused of the instant gratification generation, but really, they're the "why wait?" generation. If you have a good idea, an amazing opportunity, a chance to make change, then do it! Whereas millenials see failure as affirmation that everything is horrible and \textbf{nothing} will ever change, I see Gen Z pick themselves up, dust themselves off, and go, "Well, that didn't work. Let's try something else." What this video described as impatience among the Gen Z when something doesn't work, I see as a generation that doesn't accept that it's just the way things are. If it's broken, then fucking fix it!Bottom line, both our generations get shit on and told we're the problem. That we're entitled and selfish, but we're neither. We're just a bunch of people trying to figure out how to survive in this world that was created for us.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!27}1/384 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.26 \\  \hline

The majority of middle school was just me becoming sadder and sadder, and realizing how horrible the world really was. But eventually I managed to pick myself up, and am optimistic for the future. My optimism is based on my experience of things eventually getting better, and my mindset of trying new things when your original plan didn't work is me trying to pave a better future for myself.

Also, it makes no sense for the dates you chose. A generation takes time, it has to be more than 15 or so years for it to actually count. If you counted every 15 or less years it would make too few people part of one generation thus minimalizing the need for generations. It more sense to have it as increments of 20 or so, especially considering that most people raised from 1980-2000 grew up on the same/similar historical events. Really generations are about the historical events in society that you grew up and, thus, how they affected your growth into middle \textbf{age}. No one past 2000 has experienced anything in history like what ppl born from 1980-2000 have thus the break has to begin after 2000 and not mid 90s.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Too much generalization on each generation. The older part of any generation is vastly different from the younger part of that generation, and is a problem with having 15 years or more belonging to the same general generation. I'm 33, and I have more in \textbf{common} with views of the previous generation than what you say millennials are. Also, preferring to work in teams or solo? That is not a generational thing, its a personality thing. My younger cousins all love working in teams and such because it means the work can be spread out and if they don't want to work hard they don't need to since someone else will pick up the slack. While I love working by myself since if I don't get the work done, it's on me, if it's done, then it's because I did it. It's not a generation thing, but rather more of how people were raised and how their personalities are.Also, saying don't focus on the years too much. That's a bad idea. People are 100 confused by what is a millennial and what is gen Z because no one can agree on the generation years and names. Like, if you go by the years given, then Gen Z is responsible for the huge \textbf{spike} is current school shooting and the trashing of out constitution on college campuses, yet that is all being blamed on millennials by the media. Millennials by you're given range would have us out of any type of schooling except for going for doctorates. Also, lumping Gen Z like that when the youngest is what, 12 or 13. Kids just hitting puberty don't really factor into stuff like this and comparing generations isn't something viable to do until the entire generation should be in the workforce and government.Also multitasking is a myth, and isn't actually possible to do. You can rapidly change your attention from 1 task to another, but that does not make you more efficient or better at any task you are currently doing. In fact, it makes you worse at all tasks you are trying to complete. It was scientifically proven years ago that a very very small number of people could truly split their attention equally and still maintain 100 efficiency, or close to it, while doing more than 1 task at a time. In the work place, I'd rather have someone who is putting 100 of their attention into their job and not someone who thinks they can carry conversations, work and do something else at the same time.A better video would have compared Gen X to Millennials since both are actual adults, both generations have had time to make their mark in the world.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The Millennials are less optimistic because we remember how it was before 9/11... GenZ never got to experience that. It honestly makes me sad. Like, I can remember CLEARLY walking through Penn Station without seeing military guys holding AR15s every 10 feet... GenZers, it's just always been that way. Millennials are an interesting generation and I'm so glad I am an older one, because I had a 100 "offline" childhood, and then the internet got SUPER popular when I was in middle school - prime socialization \textbf{age}. I'm thankful for that. Best of both.However, I do think it's super interesting how, because we spoke on, and depended SO SO SO  MUCH on AIM and MySpace and original-texting to communicate, 100 written text, Millennials are more terrified of face to face, or even phone, conversations than GenZers (who grew up playing chatroulette and camming with rando's in Russia as tweens LOL.. kidding, but you know what I mean).... like, they probably don't even know, but that was a big thing when I was in HS and college, how my generation was scared of talking on the phone with strangers and didn't feel confident unless it was a typed conversation. It was an actual concern LOL. I mean, think about it, "video tech" as it is now - where you can easily video chat on wifi or LTE.. or even if you go back to when you could only do it on Wifi.... that's only been a thing for what, like 5-10 years? And even webcams and skype wasn't REALLY like something you'd casually use until I was out of college (2008ish).... it was JUST becoming big, and like chat roulette and those kinds of sites... but kids who were born in the late 90s or early 2000s... they were still kids when all that got popular... They grew up video chatting their grandparents, or friends from Summer camp who lived far away, and strangers too.... We didn't have that, and it's so interesting to me how that came back around. IDK it's just interesting to me that even though they're even MORE technologically dependent than we are, as this video said, they're more open to face to face interaction, and may have found the perfect balance between the two. I wonder if this will be a point of contention when millennials are bosses over genZers in the workplace eventually (or which has already started). Prob not actually, cause not like they'd CARE about texting with us, they just wouldn't mind talking on video or phone either.They say anything that existed before you were around 7, you think of as simply something that IS (like think of how you think of.. what's a good one for both generations?... ok think of the microwave; You never stop and go, "Wow... it is really something how quick this heats up food!" LOL It just is something you've always had. Anything after around \textbf{age} 7, you consider "technology". Basically, if you can clearly remember being a thinking human when it was invented. A good one for this that'll make GenZer's laugh - "Tivo" or DVR. I can remember so clearly when that was invented, and remember writing, and still have, in my HS journal, "OMG!

Why do you think Gen Y was given a silly name like "Millenial" and used as an insult by Gen Jones and Gen X. Gen X wasn't called gen X because there was a lettering system involved, it was called Gen X because... you can't really call it the orphan generation. Jones generation was busy getting divorced, remarried, and abandoning their kids so most gen X's were kids from broken families and even if they weren't this was during a time where parents were typically... terrible at being parents anyway. Thus called Gen X "dropout generation" and "lost generation" never really caught on because they were too offensive to actually use. Gen Y and Z came around because they needed a working name. (Just like the Jones generation was called Boomers II at first)Gen Z and Y's difference really is that Y grew up with the internet, and gen Z was grew up in it's hay day. "Millennial" is a shortened and dumbed down word replacing "Millennium Generation" to make it a more fun insult to sling at people.

You're painting an entire generation with one brush, when what you ought to do is blame the handful of politicians and business people who cause problems.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Most of you could not be more wrong and don't understand how generations are defined. A generation or birth cohort are a group of people who were raised in a specific span of years which lead them to have similar experiences and therefore similar values and outlooks on the world due to their experiences. In the case of Gen Y, the hint is in the name. Millennials are those who were coming of \textbf{age} around the start of the new millennium (year 2000), so this generation would start in the early 1980s since Generation X started in the early 60s and ended in the early 80s. A generation is not only defined by time but by world events - the best example being Baby Boomers because they tie in with the end of WW2 (1945/6-1964). Due to rapidly changing technologies and political landscapes via globalization now, there tend to be slight overlaps, and generations tend to vary from 15-20 years. Gen Y is shorter than prior generations because technological advances came along at exponential rates, which is why even older and younger millennials had different experiences growing up. The oldest Millennials are almost 40 now with the youngest already in their 20s, so there's no way that you're a millennial if you're a teenager or child now. The media was just so focused on Generation Y that they ignored Gen Z longer than expected.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/234 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.427 \\  \hline

I really wish we all hadn't been told as kids that we had to go to university to get a job, that it's normal to go extremely in debt for education, and that we'd all land great, high-paying government positions the moment we'd graduated. I know now that all those things are lies, but when you're a teen and every adult's telling them to you like they're the most obvious things in the world -- ESPECIALLY parents and career counsellors -- you believe them. They screwed us over pretty badly. sigh I know a lot of them were well-meaning... maybe university really was a quick path to a great job back when they were our \textbf{age}... but I DO wonder how much those counsellors were being paid to sell us an extremely expensive education product. : A lot of us got sucked in on lies to buying something we didn't need or want, and the debt is all we have to show for it. I feel like I've been defrauded. And I feel like an idiot for falling for it. I had some savings -- about \$8000 -- when I graduated high school, because I was always good with money. Now, I can't remember the last time I've had a single dollar to my name... and yeah, it's stressful. Every month, I'm not certain I'll be able to pay the rent, while eating requires I go even further into debt.And I'm one of the lucky ones who does have a job (my city's got an insane unemployment rate -- Canada's highest), albeit it's part time and always seems to be cutting my hours. :(I don't mean to complain, but sometimes it's nice to get that off the chest, eh? And besides, I want to prevent Gen Z from being sold that same lie that university is some kind of magic key to a perfect future. It's not. It's useful if you need it, or will find 4 years of study fun and can afford it. If not... consider very carefully whether it's the right choice for you. Don't put too much stock in anecdotes, but... personally, I noticed my college-educated friends are doing a lot better than us university graduates. And many people who didn't bother with advanced education are doing just fine too, if not better (via trades or the military). There are a lot of university degrees on the market, and having one just isn't enough anymore to make you stand out to an employer... so only get one if you want it, or if you know something you want to do will require it. And if you do go that route, start doing extra work (volunteering, learning skills, networking...) to differentiate yourself from the other grads, starting day one of your degree.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/494 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.202 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small +Carlo A Also, the millinneal generation experienced higher rate of college admissions. This was the era when almost everybody went to college. However, this generation also experienced the Great recession and the consequences of international affairs, 9/11, Iraq war, multiculturalism, the first \textbf{black} president. While this happened, there was cynicism growing from the opposition, the older generation, the Alt-Right movement who you now see in power, and the republican base who point to the failures of "multiculturalism", intellectualism, Obama, etc. of this generation as their narrative. Yet, they do not understand that the millinneal generation held off employment for college education, experienced recession during university studies which cut off a lot of funding, university studies devalued, and were not employed or underemployed. What happens next. When post-grad millineals find out that their education was devalued, not relevant to industry and employment, and never held a job until 22 or 23, millineals met with the previous generation mentality that they were supposed to take care of themselves at 18, have a job at that \textbf{age}, have a home by 24, get married, have children, this \textbf{old} mentality becomes the propaganda of the previous generation to denigrate the failure of millinneals without understanding that the previous generation set the foundation for this failure.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Black, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!5}3/211 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.422 \\  \hline

What happens? This generation enters college, the recession happens, all universities nationwide cut their research and programs, students get devalued education, taught only basics but not the essentials for industry and research. The recession left many of this generation without employment, living with parents, and hence losing competitiveness in employment despite their college degrees. Now, older generations are so ideologically brainwashed by idyllic America that they do not see the causes of why the millineal generation is the "loser", the despairing, and the \textbf{snowflake} generation.  Generation Z entered college with optimism because universities reinstated full curriculum and research, and hence their employability was better. Hence, why generation Z is optimistic and now will accomplish what their older siblings were prophesized to do. On top of that, generation Z were also hired right after high school in contrast to millineal generation, and hence why generation Z has the same mentality as the 50's idyllic Americana of individuality and right-wing economic policies.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small In my opinion, it seems like this whole video is just an attempt to market a product based on flattery towards their primary target group. It appears to be one drawn out click bait commercial. The reality is, every person regardless of \textbf{age}, status, \textbf{race}, location, etc..... all have a unique and important, worthwhile potential available in them and offer value. Unfortunately, many people just aren't aware of how to access that potential because of either a lack of learning opportunities, fear, lack of support from other people (who, consequently are living an identical struggle, so the cycle continues), and in a very, very large way, social conditioning (from sources just like this one). Life is a flow of balance and perspective. You can't have \textbf{old} without young, lazy without hard working, certain without uncertain. So it is with everything, it would be impossible to realize the concept of one thing without it's opposite and in that way value and importance comes from everything and everyone, regardless of what year they were born or who others might erroneously classify them as.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Old, Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/181 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.657 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The reason Gen Z are more conservative is as kids and teens we don't really see any consequences saying what we think. So we just always tell the truth. And if someone says something that we think is wrong, we don't say 'well we should try understanding' we just say that's stupid. Millennials are always worried what people will think if they speak their mind. So they go with the crowd. Gen Z don't mind standing out. You can decide which is better, and just so it's clear I am conservative and Gen Z, so maybe I'm biased, but I'm telling you how I feel so you kinda know what our thinking process is. But I just don't agree that because one person wants something different or says things are bad we should just believe them because of their \textbf{race}, \textbf{gender}, \textbf{ethnic} background etc. It's hard to look up to Millennials when the majority you see Online are crying about things that don't really seem worth crying about and seem like they just want attention. Kids don't look up to cry babies they look up to people who are tough and just deal with life. That's why we look up to the Gen X and older crowd, because Millennials seem like cry babies. Also before anyone says I'm \textbf{racist} or whatever, I am part Japanese, part Portuguese, part Filipino, and part Irish. I don't get offended if somebody who isn't Japanese is wearing a kimono, in fact I love that. I love my culture and love seeing others who love it so much they are embracing it. It's like people are looking for things to get sympathy from. I know a bunch of Japanese people who feel the same as I do and most of them are full Japanese. Unless you are like Logan Paul and are gonna paint on the Japanese flag, run through the streets, and harass people then I'm cool with you.

If any generation from any time had this technology, the same would happen. Also, think about how this generational garbage isn't the same in all places, not even in just America.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Squeaky Deeds Done Soap CleanYou mentioned that giving electronics to anyone at an early life stage can drastically affect their personalities later on in their life, which is interesting. You claimed it negatively effects the brain by "cannibalizing" it. It would also be interesting to show me this evidence that this happens. So how exactly does being exposed to this sedentary lifestyle as a child necessarily bad? The Amish? From what I know, that demographic is just too small in the US to affect generations or even public policy. I mean consider the history here; about 150 to 200 years ago the Amish was more of a sizable population to influence culture at that time, same with other immigrants or sects at that time, due primarily to agrarian living standards and the mixing of European \textbf{ethnic} religion practices. What I'm trying to say is consider history. It wasn't until the 1950's - 2000's that urban sprawl began to take form with people moving to the suburbs and metropolitan cities meaning different living standards. Which in effect began to secularize America. There are indeed immigrants today from South Americas and the Third World at arguably considerable heights like European immigrants of 100-150 years. This is most likely affecting the Millennial and Z Generation. It's all about timing, immigration, and location.I very much agree with you on the on last sentences. BUT you realize if you re examine, look carefully throughout history, you noticed about 40 and 50 years ago a generation of teenagers and young adults who were Baby Boomers at the time were derided in the youth. Fast forward about 10-20 years (sometime on the 1980's), Generation X comes up. Who do you think they hated? The Greatest Generation who were in their 50's/60's? Nope. The Boomers. This continued on for about 20 more years until the Millennials emerge (2000's) Who do you think they hated? The Gen Xers above them? Nope. The Boomers. The Gen Xers somehow got spared from all this societal blame shifting and scapegoats by the succeeding generations for reasons varied, mainly due to being a "small generation".

I also clearly remember the shift from 'brick phones' to flip phones to slide phones, I myself had a flip phone until like 7th grade when I updated to a slide phone. And I remember the pure feeling of Panik when you accidentally hit the internet button on your Motorola, cause you thought your parents had to take a loan in order to pay for that shit. When I was young no one used dvds or cds to a large extent, and I remember how annoying cassettes were when you accidentally pulled out the tape, and having kids movies like'in a land before time' on vhs, alongside some \textbf{weird} fitness/boxing video of a man in tight tights. I also remember borrowing my older sisters disc man when self made music cds became a thing. I maybe didn't still use it in my late teens. But I still grew up on it.

I mean I still own some of my \textbf{old} phones/cassettes so I don't think I have 'wrong memory's' in that area.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I was born in 1984. I remember what it was like being safe everywhere, actually having privacy, and the worldwide web didn't exist. Almost \textbf{nobody} you knew had a cellphone, and smartphones didn't exist. Texting didn't exist. You had to actually buy a paper map, and know how to read one. Pretty much everyone had manners too. Until I was 6, homosexuals were considered to be mentally ill. Punctuality used to matter too. If you were running late, you couldn't text your friends or family, so you just showed up on time, or people left. Just about everyone was white too. Back then, you could wish people "Merry Christmas", and \textbf{nobody} was offended. A person with a \textbf{mental} disability was simply referred to as "retarded", which really just means their brain is slower than average. Also, when you played sports, everyone kept track of the score, and people would lose, and not get a participation trophy or ribbon. I also remember when they started giving out participation awards. I would purposely throw them in the garbage or smash the trophies right in front of the idiots who gave them to me. See, rewarding someone for failure, used to be an insult, because it was an assumption that you were a sore loser. In junior high, we went to a gun range for a field trip.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Um Im in my mid 30s. I remember the 80s fondly and not cause all kids do. We had more freedom as children cause our parents partied more. I am NOT a millennial. And just about everything in this video was generalizations and as another comment pointed out is essentially the differences between the older and the younger; not much difference between these generations and separations of generations before the turn of the century. This video is extremely biased and says \textbf{nothing} negative about gen z. You say they multi-task but do they complete their assignments and do it well? You say they want personal space and have a "I can do it alone attitude"; really? Where? Ive yet to meet one that was halfway competent at anything that was not social media related. They dream big and attempt bullshit jobs like "Social Media Influencer" cause they think it has value. 1 make it, 99 fail rate. Gen z does not pay attention and "be in the moment" as a slide in this video suggests. Have you ever tried to employ one? They have no social skills because their lives are online, so face to face communication is very difficult for them to manage; especially if they feel "uncomfortable"; they break apart. Seriously Im not trying to be a dick about the generation; Im sure they have some good points. I feel bad that they lack so many skills because the world is not an smartphone.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small This message goes out to everyone here. Think for yourselves; don't let some clickbait video tell you how a random group of people are or 'should' be. I'm a millenial and I sadly see Gen Z falling into the same trap that my generation did. All of this is just marketing crap made to generate views. Don't buy into it, and always think for yourselves, not just for the sake of what's 'popular to like/hate' at any given point in time. Most peoples' critical thinking and observational skills seem to be in the gutter at the moment and it truly scares me. It gives me the feeling that \textbf{nothing} will ever change, even by the time I get to \textbf{old} \textbf{age}. In reality, the things they relate to millenials don't apply to much younger people (I honestly didn't know a single person my \textbf{age} back in school who enjoyed working in groups or didn't at least have a 56k modem unless they were poor, and for those that are group-minded, at the end of the day, humans are social creatures), and I'm sure anyone born as far back as the 70s (Gen X) would be able to relate to a lot of what they said for Gen Z. If anything, I would argue that Gen X was the most individualist of any modern generation, if generations are actually a thing (there is ongoing debate on this). Suffice to say, what is said for Gen Z now is the same stuff that was said about millenials back in the 2000s. I know; I was there. This is how it's always been no matter the generation (damn 60s kids being rebellious, emotional snowflakes), but I think due to overwhelming pressure by mainstream media today (yes, this includes youtube) and social media constantly feeding biased opinons to everyone 24/7, people are less likely to think for themselves now more than ever before. I highly encourage everyone to look into confirmation bias and the barnum effect. It explains very well how videos and articles of this nature operate and why they should always be taken with a grain of salt. Gen Y, you're not special. Gen Z, you're not special. What makes you special is being an individual and staying true to yourself; not according to what some infographic or marketing team says on the internet.

And like in the 60s the rebellious counter culture rebels against what has been established for decades.

(maybe a little before or after but around than either way) the maker of this video is just wrong. He said Millenials pioneered modern tech too just tossing people like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs under the bus. You know founders of tech companies that were around before these people were even born.... Over all this video was \textbf{nothing} but a elaborate WIX commercial with no solid facts... I mean...

I also find it amusing that you have early '60s babies who want to be Gen X instead of Boomers because they don't want to feel "\textbf{old}", meanwhile you have late '90s babies who want to be Millennials instead of Gen Z because they don't want to be seen as young and immature.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}1/85 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.176 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Ok... except Gen Z is the most depressed, volatile, Pharma-addicted, un-confident and entitled generation to ever walk the planet. Millennials are confused because we grew up in the days when technology wasn't so pervasive. When we were in our teens, flip phones were just becoming accessible to lower-middle class families. Tablets? More like palm pads and only adults could afford and own these. Laptops? The library is where you went to play runescape in front of a bunch of people you didn't know. Facebook? Nah, try MySpace. Amazon? I think we had Ebay, but I never used it because of all the scammers from Nigeria. Millennials grew up in the \textbf{guinea} pig \textbf{age} of the internet. We knew the difference between the cyber world and the real world. The world was full of magic as a kid because we could be outside enjoying kickball with the neighborhood kids at one point, and inside playing Pokémon on a gameboy after dinner. However, we knew the value and priority of both, and we respected the \textbf{old} traditions passed down to us from generations prior.  But Gen z... You can't even get a Gen Z to think about a question without him or her wanting to consult google. They're afraid to communicate their opinions and beliefs for fear of not getting enough 'likes' on their post.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small You should not present GenZ kids as superheroes.You said some BS about kids being able to multitask basically as many things as they want. The truth of that "fact" is that they can multitask the poo out of anything with a screen. Being able to watch a film, send an email and a text, all while balancing a fidget spinner on each of their toes is not multitasking. It's layering sources of instant satisfaction and seeing what hits first. Then snapchatting about it. But when it comes to sitting down, and unitasking a book, those lovely and useful short attention spans you mentioned impede them from enjoying the experience within.That is, what I think, the greatest danger facing what you call GenZ. Their lives are, more and more, surrounded by the superficial. Social media is basically a superficiality \textbf{race}. The prize for the winner is a perfect online life that doesn't even come close to what is real.You say GenZ prefer to work alone. I say, take away their phone and their WiFi, and leave them alone. The absence of their lifelines instantly causes that person's utility in any given situation to plummet.GenZ lacks individuality and depth is the point. Or at least your description of them does. And if they continually hear really, really smart 5-min video people like you telling them the same rubbish description of how they are. They will end up believing it.But what do you care? All this channel is doing is making that sweet cash off the 2 ads about the same website, which together, I would estimate lasted about one sixth of the entire video.Spare me your flashy animations, tell me where you got your data, and I'll read about it.Because, no matter what generation you are, if you don't read about things you mean to learn, you'll most likely become a stupid donkey.

I think of leaving facebook, but I try to use it to make my own brand and my own community. Im thinking there is a need for a page which looks like a Forum from early 2000s. Where you can have different parts of forums, dedidacted to different topics and conversations. Im thinking combination of Facebook Group and Reddit. Ayone kows of something like that? Nowadays Discord channels are kinda like that, but they dont have Topics only chat rooms that can be used for certain topics. And Reddit can create certain topics post, but there is only one Reddit for a page.

BUT our lust for killing and war caused us to spend so much money in Vietnam that we almost went belly-up, so Nixon changed from a hard currency to a fiat one that we can devalue infinitely - so basically we are watering-down everything from food to customer service in an effort to keep the system afloat while the top 1/10th of 1 take half the money in the economy.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Adam Albrec complete bullshit. "Commies did all the work"No they did not. The West kept their industries running allowing them to recover as fast as they did. If the US had not given them the raw mats to build their armed forces and keep them fed then there would have been as many as twice the number of casualties in WW2."Minority using more resources"Boo fucking hoo. Lives and work are not valued equally. I agree that some of the highest paid are getting paid that much only because they write their own paychecks with the tears of their workers but they also typically employ thousands to tens of thoudands to a pay cut would barely effect the employees anyways. As well the US is the worlds leading tech giant. Back under the commies in what the West called the USSR their were many antiscience acts done for the sake of the party. More on that relavance in a moment."Fiat currency"Is good. As the world progresses people develop new technologies that change the world. Some inventions are worth more than all the gold in the world. The reason Fiat Currency is a net good is not only due to the fact that there is not enough gold to back all the transactions happening as is but also that new fields of technology are opening up more and more resources which would depreciate the value of the currency like the Spanish Treasure Ships. That is a bad thing dumbass. With affordable space lift that is coming along we can access all the materials of the solar system. What would you value gold at when you can access enough to make everyone solid gold houses. It would end as a fiat currency anyways."Vietnam"Was not our fault. The Korean War, caused by the Reds putting a puppet on the throne, was inverted and done by the West in this instance. The NViets were the ones that started that fight. And resulted in the US not supporting an ally due to internal pressure which resulted in many civilians getting sent to reeducation camps to become good \textbf{commie} dogs for their leaders."Capitalism == Oppression"And Communism isn't? In \textbf{communist} countries you would get imprisoned or killed if, as a farmer, a bad flood destroyed your harvest. Those were actual Police states where wrong think was a crime worthy of torture. At least in the US you can call your leader a bastard and degenerate imbicile and not get dragged away and dealt with while your family watches. Capitalism works well with checks and balances much like politics.And finaly some assumptions about you."Complete SJW"Congrats on being a monster who is anti-science, anti-equality, and anti-liberty. You think that a system that promotes efficency would stoop to mindless villiany, scientific rationale eludes you because you live with your feels over reals, and equality isn't equal because the formerly oppressed group isn't in a position of power. The commies promoted the idea that plants work together to survive which lead to mass famnine and you think that there are people who will work for the betterment of others for no reason other than muh oppression even though you yourself are unwilling to put forth an effort. Competition is a strength and capitalism encourages it. Communism encourages lazyness because why work when you will get the same shit anyways. The commies had to switch to rewarding people for hard work, which sounds oddly capitalist mind you, other wise no one would do anything unless under threat of pain or death.Please keep posting about your world of "equality, happiness, and good leader karl marx" so others will wisen up.

For example, I'm a Millenial (92) and while I share values with Gen X, like the DIY mentality and preference for Youtube-Netflix over traditional TV, I seriously hate the way children are exposed to gadgets too soon, because their parents are too overwhelmed and it ends up the only way they get any peace and quiet.

These things are very vague to begin with and differs between opinions in views but being so specific with dates, ages, and names are not necessary much.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Millennials should be shit on. Growing up with facebook and parenting styles at the time taught them that they can get anything in the world and do anything and get participation medals even if they suck. They don't understand that the real world requires working hard and getting shit done to get anywhere in life. Some people say its just because of their upbringing, but frankly thats a cop out. Something millennials do too often already anyway. They are also to blame for their shitty behaviour and lack of work ethic. Because they used their social media platforms to create echo chambers of their own shitty ideologies. Here's an example. We all know that hate speech is bad, but free speech is vital to a proper society. Not millennials though. They created groups online and talked about this shit with millions of like minded individuals and refused to take input from anyone who didn't already agree. Now we have university campuses everywhere that are straight up against free speech. They think that instead of someone needing thick skin and taking an insult, the insult needs to be prevented by some third party. Millennial feminists blame the \textbf{patriarchy} as if its some kind of god, millennials are what drove BLM to its extreme, the list goes on. Its not a coincidence that all these social groups have gone so extreme at the time when the millennials got to an \textbf{age} where they become politically active. They think the world is to blame for their personal problems and that society owes them something. I'll leave you with this final point. I'm a millennial. Most millennials are so pathetic and quick to point out a single meaningless point or blame something else, that they will say, "Ha you said you deserve to be shit on" rather than tackling the arguments I've raised here.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Brian Troy that 'participation medal' thing is a load of bull and you know it.

We wanted the big prize, the big trophy and the bragging rights that came with it. Don't generalize us all just because we got handed trophies we honestly didn't even want to begin with. We also didn't 'grow up with' Facebook. Hell, a few of us missed the advent of the internet by a few years. On average, by the time Facebook opened up shop, we were already in high school or college, almost into legal adult territory (going by 18+). As for entitlement, you're talking out your ass again. I personally am holding two jobs just to pay the bills because the company I previously worked for in the startup tech sector hit a rough financial patch and had to have layoffs that quarter.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Seals, I take it you got to "participation medal" and stopped reading. I too am a millennial bro. I'm 26. If you got to the end of my post you'd have seen that I predicted millennial would be more likely to be butt hurt and attack me, rather than actually countering my arguments. This is pretty close to what you did. Though I'll grant that you made a couple points... in my favour. You're a very rare case friend, probably because you're in tech. Devs seem to be more proactive and actually out there doing things, they also have a much easier job market. But the participation medal thing did affect a lot of people. It instilled this idea that everyone deserves shit, its why our generation fights so hard for equality of outcome rather than equality of opportunity. Why we are the generation that made safe spaces and \textbf{fat} acceptance movements. Why we are the generation that thinks generalizing is a crime. I mean think about it. Why are you even offended, you read my post, you saw that it spoke generally of millennials, the words may not apply to you specifically, that doesn't make it wrong. you are one data point bro. As am I. The fact is we have on record the worst work ethic and the most entitled activists of any generation. I didn't make that up, google it. Look at what our generations activists fight for vs previous generations. wanting exactly 50/50 men and women in all the high paying jobs? How the fuck is that fighting for equality, when you look at the stats of what degrees people get and what fields they go into, the \textbf{gender} split in every industry makes perfect sense. Our generation constantly fights for things they feel entitled to, rather than any real form of oppression. You could be right that its not a product of participation medals and social media confirmation bias. Thats what some people say and my best theory so far as well. Either way, you just chose to be offended. Why? a general statement means its "generally true", not "true in every case". Some people suggest that our generation gets so offended because participation medals actually ruined our self esteem and self confidence. because even when we lost we were given things that we knew we didn't deserve. So it made us feel even worse. That's surely true for some people, but I think more people became entitled my it. Admittedly thats my opinion vs someone else's, none of this has been studied enough to know 100 yet. Either way, stop fearing generalizations and realize that if a post doesn't describe you it shouldn't offend you.

Since I grew up with dial-up internet and with both Windows 95 and Windows 98 when each one of those had came out.

After graduated from high school in 2004. I also remember when the first DVD came out but until then I always had to watch movies on a VHS tape in a VCR.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I'd argue the real qualifier for gen Z isnt access to smartphones and iPads while growing up but access during formative years or younger, coupled with social media. I believe I used the internet for the first time when I was around 8 or 9. I do not remember having a computer in the home until mid-late elementary school. I remember when you accessed the internet via dialup and would get free trials on CD-ROM from America Online in the mail. You couldn't use the landline and use the internet simultaneously unless you had a second landline. I got my first cell phone at the \textbf{age} of 15 in 2005. It was a flip phone with minimal web browsing ability. I think you could do a google search but it would load in about a minute. MySpace did come and go, but it did not have the profound societal effect that Facebook has had. I spent the entirety of high school without a Facebook account, as it was only open to non-college students as of the year 2008 which was my \textbf{senior} year of high school. Facebook shifted the gears of personal expression for teens and fundamentally changed the way they value themselves and the way they judge others. Couple that with the addictive nature of cellphones, and you've got a generation that is subject to a completely different and virtual social experience right at their fingertips that I quite simply did not have. My argument would be if you spent the entirety of high school with either access to Facebook or at least awareness of it and it's influence you are not a millennial. So, essentially if you were around 13 or younger in 2008 you are not a millennial.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Senior & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}2/291 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.687 \\  \hline

I don't like being able to make a call with basically a small tablet and I don't like having the VAST amount of knowledge on the internet at my fingertips ALL THE TIME, you end up relying on the internet for knowledge about EVERYTHING... and to me, that is scary to think about.

I used to watch my older sister's copy of sailor moon season 2, and dragon tails on it. SideNote: Though the 90s technically ended 2000, the culture didn't totally fade out till around 2005.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small People tend to have differing abilities to remember back to early ages. For most people, it seems to be that their memories start back around the \textbf{age} of 5. There are certainly people who can remember further back, but there are also people who can't even remember that far back. There can never be a precise cutoff date because people are not all the same. Generation dates aren't rough either. Different sources say different dates. That's why I said around 1996 instead of saying the cutoff IS 1996. To say it is 1996 is giving it more certainty than there really is. I would say that someone born near the cutoff date can self-identify as whichever generation that exemplifies their values more. I am surprised that you don't remember 9/11 if you remember a lot of things from that time-frame. Sure, you weren't in the US, but it was a big deal internationally too. And it changed the tone of how the US interacts with the world drastically, so it does affect the lives of pretty much the entire world because the US sticks their hands into everything.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/188 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.532 \\  \hline

I think this is because my parents felt it would be inappropriate to explain such a thing to a four year \textbf{old}. In contrast I do remember the leaders debate leading up to Paul Martin's election when I was 5. Probably because my parents felt it was approp. In school \textbf{nothing} was mentioned. I only found out about terrorists a couple years later and assumed they were something that had always existed. Yes it affected everything, but for a toddler in a foreign country the effect isn't immediately apparent.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Earl Miller, a neuroscientist at MIT and one of the world experts on divided attention, says that our brains are 'not wired to multitask well… When people think they're multitasking, they're actually just switching from one task to another very rapidly. And every time they do, there's a cognitive cost in doing so.' So we're not actually keeping a lot of balls in the air like an expert juggler; we're more like a bad amateur plate spinner, frantically switching from one task to another, ignoring the one that is not right in front of us but worried it will come crashing down any minute. Even though we think we're getting a lot done, ironically, multitasking makes us demonstrably less efficient.Multitasking has been found to increase the production of the stress hormone cortisol as well as the fight-or-flight hormone adrenaline, which can overstimulate your brain and cause \textbf{mental} fog or scrambled thinking. Multitasking creates a dopamine-addiction feedback loop, effectively rewarding the brain for losing focus and for constantly searching for external stimulation. To make matters worse, the prefrontal cortex has a novelty bias, meaning that its attention can be easily hijacked by something new – the proverbial shiny objects we use to entice infants, puppies, and kittens.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I was born in spring 97, so I am either a young millennial or a cusper. Almost half of my life, I lived without even dreaming about the idea of a phone that people can keep in their pockets to make calls outside their home or this program on the computer that lets people google up random nonsense. Also, i have a few memories of ‘99 that I myself remember vividly experienced though the memories arent as detailed as someone who would be five at that time. 97 is the last year a person can be born in to remember the 90s without the need of photos or videos. I dont remember 9/11 thankfully, i mean who would want to remember the worst day of the early 2000s. I do remember preschool before 9/11 and stuff. Yeah, either young millennial or a cusper. I just dont feel like an \textbf{old} gen z, and I am not going to say that I do just to make you happy.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small As a 97er, i consider myself a young millennial; i have vague memories that I remember experiencing in 99 after I turned 2. Also, I was \textbf{old} enough to attend preschool during the 99-2000 school year, but the preschools in my city didnt take anyone under 4 years \textbf{old}, but preschool is optional in my country. 1995-1997 are the same generation cause they were preschoolers in 1999. I dont relate to gen z cause i didnt have a computer at home until I was 5, our family never had outside phones until I was like 8 give or take a month or two on either end from my eighth birthday; we first got a laptop and internet access only when I was in third grade. I first saw a flatscreen tv only when I was like 6-8. Flatscreen computer monitor when I was 9-11.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I feel like a lot of these points are going to become moot in a few years simply because of \textbf{age}. Optimism and a forgiving nature, for instance are typically things that are edited and updated with respect to their statistical evidence of being proved true or false over time. I know that the older I get, the more interactions I have to prove my initial beliefs are valid or not depending on my interactions with all sorts of people. After so many years of subtly accumulating data (often subconsciously) about the interactions I was correct or not correct about I begin to formulate statistical biases when conditioned by previous interactions of a similar type. My theory is that all people develop these and we believe when younger that these are failings or denote an unwillingness to change when really this is the inevitable course of our experience, for better or for worse. This is sort of a straw man for getting older, to rate things in willingness to collaborate, optimism, and confidence in our ability. These are the same qualifiers given to the millenials before, gen x, the baby boomers and the "greatest generation". In ten years, we will hear the same argument made for whatever the next \textbf{age} defined tribe is, with the gen zs made out as sticks in the mud.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/224 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.893 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Not eniterly correct. Doing several things at the same time is handled not by different parts of the brain, but by different neural processes (actually 3 main ones), and frequently performed highly automated tasks are simply handled by neural processes beyond the frontal cortex conscious actvity. It happens in so called basal ganlgia and this neural activity needs a lot of repetition in order to retain the pattern of neural activity needed to perform each "subconscious task". This is for example why learning how to drive a car while doing other things requires a lot of practice. Frontal cortex can handle with high accuracy only 1 task at the time and we know that each added conscious task decreases performance per each task by 30. So in other words everyone trying to handle many conscious tasks at the same time, what we do refer to as real multitasking is doomed to make some errors in each. And lowers his own performance. So a multitasking employee has a very low accuracy. What is expensive if high level of precision and accuracy is required in a particular workplace.

We may be the young generation now but give it thirty to forty years and there will be a new wave of kids who will do a better job for less money. My parents always warned me about this. I'd prefer to be my own boss,work in a lush home office and maintain my own brand. Probably live in a three story house while my kids are off at private school that's not religion oriented and my wife or husband is out working as a doctor or lawyer. I blog on my spare time and just to keep me mentally sharp and during the summers my spouse,our five (yes five) kids and I take trips to exotic locations where they can learn about all the different walks of life. And we take the occasional trips to Disney in August just to indulge. Around Christmas and Thanksgiving we volunteer at soup kitchens and participate in habitat for humanity. I have enough in my savings account to retire by 53 and travel the world with my spouse. As a hobby I write books about kickstarting a company and such. I've set good career paths for all my kids and have helped them breed and refine whatever passion they have. And I also I payed off my student loan instantaneously by 28 along by adding in some endowment. Hopefully along the way I'm able to give a tedXtalk and donate to meaningful charities to get tax breaks. That's the American dream. We can plan as much as we want but of course life will always add it's own little curves. If I get the company owning,home office,marital,kid and retirement goals checked in I'll be satisfied. My American dream is just being able to bring five human beings into the life(whether natural,surrogate or adoption) and giving them the opportunities I never had while growing up. I want to start a company,find love and die satisfied at a ripe \textbf{old} \textbf{age}.

Make sure to consider the individual before the stereotype, these only "tend" to be descriptions of those people in those generations but never an exact representation of each individual.My personality might be a little different as i've been more at my house than outside and more time with myself than with others, therefore i'm in the mindset of being independent and rather work by myself than to collaborate, but neither do i not enjoy going out with friends, i get excited when we schedule an outing or something, but if i had any choice i would choose to rather have a nice honest talk with my friends than to play Basketball...\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/425 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.235 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I was born in 1991 i.e. millennials time. Here is my experience.  First thing How small 'between 17 and 27' felt . It was so fast. Believe me it hardly felt like a period. To me 14 to 17 was way longer. Those who are at 17 or 18 are just on the threshold of true "real adulthood" (i.e. being part of working class ). In my younger days I believed everything that my elders said, like how this job sector will be lucrative and how the easy to pay loan. I graduated with help of education loan in 2013. With my luck my got job quick. It was peaceful for a couple of year but pay was less. 5 years went by and I am still clearing my loan. A big chunk of it is cleared (much better than what usually happens), but it took all my capacity to save. Things are getting expensive, everything including home, healthcare, food and grocery. Being unhealthy is very tiring especially when it takes away so much money and also your income is hampered on daily basis. Most terrifying thing of this \textbf{age} is the speed everything is changing in this world. I lost my job due change of technology (mainly automation). While I am still very optimist about my prospect, I know the It will be tough. I don't think that there is any special difference between Gen Z  and millennial, I was like that in my teenage. We used to think same for our elders. But for us it is a tough time now, and Gen Z will have it tougher, especially when they are grown in most easygoing lifestyle. My suggestion to anyone would be to grow as many as faculties and skills, be it normal plumbing, simple cooking or web chatting. Cultivate industrious nature instead of easygoing. Meet as many people and make friendship with them. In coming time we will need to support each other. Time of being individualist is over, now being collective is as important. Good relationship and family, neighbors everyone is important. Coming time has big challenges are there, if tackled correctly there can be some opportunities. But in coming time one has to do a lot of labor, amount of work needed is insane.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/380 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.263 \\  \hline

For whatever reason, the Sociologists or whoever studies this aren't in concert with the exact ranges, because credible sources all differ slightly. Google and look into it, you'll find the same.

Two of his sources are Wikipedia articles that basically say \textbf{nothing}. One is an editorial blog on the Huffington Post,  the other three are editorial blogs written by business consulting firms. None of these are reliable sources on this topic. They are not peer-reviewed, there is \textbf{nothing} scientific about them, there is no reason to accept anything they say, and they have massive conflicts of interest (Wikipedia excepted).There simply isn't any reliable data on the Gen Y/Gen Z comparison, partly because members of Gen Z aren't even adults yet. I couldn't find a consistent year for the cutoff of who is and isn't Gen Z, because people can't even agree on that yet. If we assume the cutoff is 2000, then at best the oldest Gen Zers are just turning 18 this year.

They seem to be very specialized into certain fields snd completely oblivious to anything outside it.Millenials are kinda ok. But at times very obnoxious. They have very broad understanding of things and and soak up learning quite well. When i try to explain things. They will rarely argue against it.Unlike Gen X.Generation Z however seem to be more like Gen X again. And completely helpless without internett.While millenials and Gen X can survive a couple of days without internett.Gen Z goes apeshit over just a couple of hours without.Many also like to argue against you just like gen X with better know how where instead of experience from \textbf{age} its i've seen it on the internett type of deal.Also when it comes to internett vournability. Millenials are the most sceptic and seem to be most aware of internett security.While Gen X and Gen Z are completely oblivious to them.Basic things such as admin rights to their routers are open and easy to access to.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I feel like we need to either re-classify or acknowledge some sort of transitionary generation who experienced I guess the benefits of an \textbf{age} of social media and the tech revolution of the 2000's, while still retaining some experiences of the 90's household dynamic. I didn't wake up in 1998 to suddenly have a completely different life to my siblings born in 1994 and 1991; as far as we were all concerned, the family still used a dial-up PC until the mid-2000's, were slow to follow the pace of progress, particularly tech improvements, and yet in the 2000's my millennial brother and sister are just entranced with social media as I am, a Gen Z. There's \textbf{nothing} wrong with noting some distinctly different traits of the two generations and I'm not triggered by generalisations such as this, but I feel like it's important those individuals or even households born in this transitional phase aren't classified too closely with either generation because in my case, as a 20 year-old I'm neither close to a 13 year-old Logan Paul stan and merch supporter, nor a 35 year-old settled-down family man\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!27}2/188 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.064 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I'm a '98 birthday as well. As someone has just mentioned these lines are essentially arbitrary, I wasn't allowed access to the PC that was in my attic until I was 6 years \textbf{old}, didn't get a smartphone until I was 15, and only began watching DVDs instead of VCRs when I was 7. Maybe this speaks to how slow my family were when it came to keeping up with technology, but I certainly don't feel like a Gen Z. For me, the cut offs would be 1945-1968 for Baby Boomers, 1969-1985 for Gen X, 1985-1999 for millennials, and 2000-2012 for Gen Z.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Toastee actually they're usually marked by a multitude of things. Namely, world changing disasters like wars or in this case, 9/11. The media is what now determines the generation gaps for marketing purposes, based on trends of different \textbf{age} groups.

If you were too young to remember the things I mentioned in the first camp though, and were young enough to love post-2005 shows like Johnny Test for example, and considered them a fond childhood memory, you'd fit more into Gen Z.Late 90s babies started off Gen Z really, with Hannah Montana and High School musical and Fred and other shit like that.

People raised in different areas will be different, people raised in different family styles will be different, having younger or older siblings makes a difference. But one thing is constant. Businesses will try and create groups of people and try to manipulate the behavior and ideas of those people in order to profit off those people.

Yes school is stressful, but our grounded focus on achievable things will help you to be sucessful in the working enviorment. Don't worry too much about school. I would also recommend you to not even worrying being top of the class, but idk where are you from and what you can get from it.

As a result, I tend to get along better and relate more to older millennials (early 80s) and the very young Gen Xers.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}1/67 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.493 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small All generation have the good and the bad, but I think this man went a little to easy on GenZ... as each generation has its own egoistic people And as much I hate to admit Gen Z is full of them. :(  Their form of thinking is rooted in individuality, and is not uncommon in a culture that bases itself on the ideal of rugged individualism. Each of us is, after all, unique and one of a kind. One who contemplates deeply on this uniqueness of the self, comes to realize that there is a world of difference between being unique and being individualistic.       A unique person is truly one of a kind, whereas an individualistic person is quite \textbf{common} and ordinary. Individuality is the quality of ego, whereas uniqueness is an inherent quality of the soul-self, the pure consciousness. As we all know, Ego is the false identification of the conscious self with the mind and body. The soul-self, or pure consciousness, is consciousness devoid of ego expression. When we are really not in our ego, we experience directly the beauty of life, and that experience is always unique, it is always ever-new, and it is not possible to copy that experience in the memory or find a substitute for it. On the other hand, when we are in our ego we intuitively know that our experience is limited, and the mind and ego then react by attempting to cover up our lack. Ego reacts by asserting itself and claims dominion over the mind, which it uses to manufacture images to prop itself up. Ego-individualistic-self-confidence is a very poor substitute for the soul confidence, (WHICH A LOT OF GEN Z SHOW ALL OVER SOCIAL MEDIA) In fact, it is no substitute at all, because there is no substitute for the state of imageless awareness. By its very nature, ego does not let us experience the universality of Truth, because to do so would negate the existence of ego. But of course, ego wants to believe it knows everything, so it creates its own Truth, because to know the Truth makes the ego feel important and powerful, even though the truth it knows is not the Truth at all but only its own images. This is why ego holds onto its images, including its images of universality. No one can really tell you the Truth unless you are ready to hear it, which means no one can teach you the Truth unless you are ready to learn it. Emotional maturity and the desire to learn are both prerequisites.We become emotionally mature when we begin to realize that the whole world does not revolve around us. The less self-involved we are, the more fit we become for self-realization. Every insight we have into the real nature of our being increases our desire to learn more. The time comes when our desire for Self Knowledge out weighs all other desires. It is not possible to see clearly if our perception is clouded by our misconceptions, images, and false knowledge. As long as we are holding onto our ego we will remain confused and unhappy. We need to drop our ego by letting go of our images and begin with a clean slate. We need to empty the picture filled with mud and water, so that the fresh water can be poured into it. We need to empty our mind of all our preconceived notions of Truth in order to learn the Truth from within. When we drop our ego and images we become simple, humble, human beings, who are eager and earnest to get to the bottom of the matter and experience the Truth directly.Everyone who has had a taste of divine bliss, a taste of Truth, knows without any doubt that is absolutely real and far beyond the realm of mind, intellect, and ego. Everyone who has had an insight into the Nature of Truth, knows unequivocally that this Truth is Universal and has \textbf{nothing} at all to do with individuality, morbidity, mortality, and immorality.People who are individualistic, people who are depressed and morbid, people who are dying everyday in selfishness, and people who are living immoral, fiendish, degrading lives do not know the real meaning of this beautiful human life. They remain asleep in Ignorance and continue to suffer in the duality of their nightmares and fantasies until they awaken to the still small voice within, the whisper of their own soul beckoning them to return home to their True Self, to reclaim their inheritance of Supreme Ecstasy and Divine Love. I'm saying this because even though I'm considered Gen Z (I'm 21) a lot of Gen z on social media are egotistic as hell calling themselves 'woke' and they tend to tear others opinions and belittle the person bc they don't agree with the opinion. These Gen Z kids want 'positivity' and wants 'good vibes' and claim to be 'open minded' but they go fishing for drama and negativity or they look for every little thing to be 'offended' by bc it's how their minds are trained nowadays. I'm sorry for this super long comment, but I love you all! No matter what generation you're from there's love for everyone, Even those who haven't discovered the Truth but you will ! We just have to uncover our souls! We may all be unique in different ways, but we're all still ONE we're no more special than the next person.

They, as kids, never got disciplined, so now they as parents don't know how to discipline.And no, I didn't bring millennials into this just to harp on them for the sake of it, but from what I've witnessed in person and heard from my parent who is exposed to this daily, they are a pretty \textbf{common} denominator as parents to such unruly children.The older geneeration needs to take a stand and not be so much of a push-over and toughen up those emotions of theirs.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Gen Z is a moronic name. Gen X is named for the roman numeral for 10 because they are the 10th generation (considering one every 20 years) after 1776. They were anywhere from birth to young adults somewhere near 1976. I was born in 1980, which is kind of the border between Gen X and Millenials.Gen Y never made sense and was eventually replaced with "millenial". If you were going to use the Gen X naming convention, it would have been Gen XI and the new generation would be Gen XII. But that's \textbf{dumb}.iGen isn't a bad name, but I think largely it makes the mistake that is often made when defining a new generation: taking the characteristics of youth and ascribing them to the generation. Rather, I would use something that really defines how the world has changed for them. They are growing up in a post-9/11 world filled with terrorism, both real and propped up as an excuse for war. They are witnessing the rise of dictators in many nations.I would call them something like "terror babies."

The divide is only noticeable with the older Gen who did not experienced information technology in their teens.

I agree with most of this video,  pretty accurate for my generation actually.   Some of us went the college route though, as it is though, sometimes it worked for some, and meanwhile it didn't for others.  College is a gamble, especially because it really depends where you live, and what the demand is for what ever degree you are trying to acquire.  Alternative learning is the best thing about the internet, the problem is obtaining credentials for it I come to find.  Employers I find look at experience opposed to just purely pieces of paper.  Pieces of paper are important for setting out a pathway to give some legitimacy to know what the fuck you are talking about.   Otherwise though, the vast majority of jobs available to us are predominately min wage cluster fucker jobs, which really do not need any type of actual "degree."  I guess it is just look at the market around you and try to pander to the demands of your community, and if it doesn't coincide to those demands, then pretty much move.   Guys my \textbf{age} are either grinding at work, or are studying to try to make themselves better.  I am doing both because I am in my early 20's so it's all fine and well I guess.

It doesn't mean \textbf{nobody} from said generation will repair anything in their entire life.Stereotypes describe tendencies.

I'm taking about the feminism that sold women the lie that they could both have a full time career and be a good parent at the same time. I'm not talking about people who had to do that out of necessity. Fact of the matter is, being a mother is a full time career choice. You can no more be a good engineer and doctor at the same time as being a mother and a lawyer at the same time. That is why we had marriage in the first place: To have one parent looking after the kids, and one bringing home the bacon. Now, I'm not saying the parent staying home needs to be the mother - but that seems to be the way nature works in most mammals, and I'm betting there is a reason for that. All feminism did now was to lower salaries so that a single parent can no longer provide for his family alone. You know, the \textbf{old} "supply and demand" thing playing out. So now, we're basically stuck in a world were it is difficult for a man to provide for his family on a single pay check - even if the wife prefers to stay at home.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I was born in 1991, so I'm a Millennial. I grew up with my parents and the schools telling us if we just worked and studied hard then we'd get the jobs we wanted and everything would be great. The recession (Called the credit crunch here in the UK) happened around the time I was finishing school, businesses were closing down left, right and centre and I'd gone to look for work rather than go to college (I honestly was fed up of school and didn't want to be learning anything after. So our careers service was like "Lol go to college, you won't find work now, just stay there a few years and the jobs market'll recover."So went to college from 2007-2010, \textbf{nothing} really recovered much then, but there was this thing in the UK introduced a while before then, but had really taken off called "workfare", the basic gist of that was you were supposed to work for your benefits, okay fair enough really, but companies started sacking/firing their staff and hiring them back for basically free to work for a lot less than they were doing before. I'd worked a couple of months in 2010 until the company told me and the other guy in the IT department "Oh we can only afford to pay one of you, so we're going to have to let the other go." I felt as I'd only been there a few months and the other guy had a wife and a kid on the way I should take the bullet. He was grateful for it and I'd do it again, but thing was I'd ended up having to work for the same company in order to get welfare.

Conflicts have defined most of what I see: 9/11 and other \textbf{terrorist} attacks, Afghanistan, Iraq, internal conflicts and rebellion in the Middle East and border wars (Gaza, Ukraine). The 2008 financial crisis was significant for my family, and the years of recovery from that. Because of this I'm very cautious with the money I earn, and when I do shop I do it online. My access to information and knowledge is instant and the way I was taught was much more different than how my older siblings or parents were. The rise of social media and online communications is unprecedented I've made ‘friends' (though obviously not in the traditional sense) across the world. This has also led to some contradictions in the culture of youth, trends are certainly significant and widespread but I don't think there is one that has/will define this one. Rather, there will be many of these trends, if that makes sense... Politics. In terms of social views, much of the generation (though obviously not all) would likely be more liberal or at least centre left. In terms of economics, I find that there's a more even spread.

Additionally, Since the housing crisis, costs of shelter is high while those who are trying to sell those homes have to sell them at a deficit, which leaves them at a financial loss.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!27}1/101 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.99 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The Oily Boily Guy Well I can instantly destroy your argument. My uncle who is also a millennial joined the Army for 4 years. Then he got a college degree, now he is working for a major tech company with a nice house and used to live in a real expensive condo in Seattle. So in otherwords, he wasn't at a financial lost at all.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Christian Murrell 1. Last time I checked a house was not a luxury, buying luxuries don't compare to buying a house since the average person (in any generation, given salary) would have to pay mortgages on a house since not many people can outright buy one. 2. The whole narrative that milienals are all taking \textbf{gender} studies, and sociology is a falsely pushed idea, since the same 10 most popular degrees have been the same for a decade (management, accounting, nursing, etc.). 3. STEM pushing (going to high schools and telling kids to be \textbf{engineers}) has been around for 20 years which has caused a rise in different engineering majors, who can't find a decent wage.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Engineers, Gender & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/116 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.724 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Gunmasterx7 Congratulations to your uncle, but you missed the point of my argument. A lot of houses in the US were overpriced and therefore no one would buy from the previous owners. Which gave them no choice but to sell the house at a lower value (assuming they don't do any serious renovations to up the value). So milienals can't buy the house since its too expensive, and previous generations can't sell their houses since no one will buy. Also as said previously, \textbf{gender} studies, sociology, and all those "liberal degrees" are not and have not been the most popular degrees.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Oh, but I also owned a typewriter! I completely forgot I owned one! I didn't had a computer at the time, but my handwriting severely sucks so I decided to buy a second hand type writer to make sure I at least had readable homework! It still failed epically though, typing on those things are so hard. My real name is 'Chelsea' but I wrote 'Chewbaca', as for example I had accidentally pressed EW instead of simply E. I felt like sinking to the ground of accidentally spelling my name as a mispelling of a Star Wars character. Have you ever managed to type correctly on yours? I definitely prefer the keyboard of my laptop, and there are no ink blobs either. I couldn't count how many times the ink hadn't dried quickly enough yet and I got my fingers covered with ink when taking it out of the machine. I also owned lots of books, I still do. My favourite comics when I was a kid were the ElfQuest comics originating from 1978. I still like to read some occasionally, especially the side comic about Tyleet adopting this human kid.  I personally mix everything from different generations to suit my needs. I had a bit of an \textbf{old}-fashioned upbringing. No kissing, make-up and heels until 16, for example. No game consoles, etc until I was in my teens. So I probably have less problems with having 'unpopular' vintage/retro things in my household since I have some \textbf{old}-fashioned qualities anyway. I'm equally interested in things like virtual reality games in an epic fantasy world setting as I am in villages with a more \textbf{old} fashioned way of living and who still do things like potbakery.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small thumbnail is wrong, you're a millenial. Millenials are born between 1983 and 1998 if you ask me. So like 19 to 36. Kinda like how baby boomers are between their 50s and their 70s, i think its a bigger generation that its given credit for. i'm a month older than you and i wasn't born into a world of tech - my family didn't even own a computer till i was 10 and it had a dial up connection. the iphone was first available when i was 12. I remember and was affected, though significantly less than americans my \textbf{age} were, by 9/11. I saw the world change rapidly in the wake of the tech boom and the terrorism fear.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I was born in 1997 in a town of 2,000 people. I don't feel like I belong to either, considering the speed of which technology has been evolving and changing the world, as well as global events changing people's perspectives. On one hand, I see where many millennials are coming from. Big corporations continue to gain more and more power in our country, influencing our politics adversely. And to an extent, PC culture can be a good thing. I was taught not to be a dick to people just because I don't understand who they are. However, PC culture can get out of hand, and I think a lot of people see only the most extreme perspectives. The reality is most people just want to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of who people perceive them to be. I also tend to lean towards Gen Z in regards to attitude. I'm a very impatient person and would rather do things myself, and I'm less likely to let people's mistakes go unchecked. I believe that people should be held accountable for their mistakes or sleights against me, not ignored. I'm just \textbf{old} enough however that I was told to go to college at all costs and that getting a degree would automatically make me successful. If you're a young  Gen Z reading this, be sure to do your research on degree plans and job opportunity for the career you want to go into. Getting yourself \$20,000 into debt (that's a lowball estimate)  isn't worth doing a job you'll make 35,000 a year with. You don't have to go to college to be successful, but make sure that you can be successful if you don't go to college.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}1/287 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.348 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small This is deep occult info and yall who read should be glad you have. This is why, and you may never remember this unless you remember past lives, that the years 1 - 999 played out a microcosm of what will be year 1000 - 9999. Because every 100 years, a new generational outlook is introduced, so the 100s play out starting with 1, up until 199, and then 200-299 play out beings in similar fashion to 2000-2999, just the more numbers the more complexity of consciousness. And thus the first 999 years played out beings of 100-200-300 (trinity conscious, a being aware of itself more highly within a surroundings, as 3 comes back to 1, because 1 dad and 2 mom creates 3 child, but the child is itself a 1 individual combining and creating a totality. Which is why 3,6,and 9 create totalities. Is why 3 goes back to 1 and 6 goes back to 2 and 9 goes back to 3 the tri-trinity in which 9 is 3 totalities creating 1 larger totality, but this is off topic.)So 100-200....etc till 700-800-900. These beings are that new wave of conscious perceptions. Thus the world of a 198 year person is far lost by 240 year, because it's almost like a new species changing its perceptions of how to be and interact with others, itself, and the environment.This is what is happening now with 1900 perceptions beginning to clash at the new 2000 world.1 beings are different than 2. 1 is more selfish, thinks for itself and about self. \textbf{Nothing} wrong with it. 2 cares to relate with others and will care for the world. The issue is when those older generation have accrued such strength to keep the mind set of the older 1000-1999 alive that they'll take control of the minds of the 2000 generations with businesses of this world integrating into the virtual capacities of phones and computers.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Well I think that it's worth considering that millennials (in a general sense) are so pessimistic because they were caught off guard by the harsh nature of reality after years of being told that everything is fine by their much older parents. Conversely, Gen Z saw the Great Recession of 2008 at early ages and what's more, the fact that we've grown up surrounded by technology means that we have far more access to information from an early \textbf{age} than did the generations before us. So in a sense I don't think we're necessarily more "optimistic" but rather I think that we're just more aware and therefore accepting of how reality can be. Not to perpetuate the tired stereotype of millennials being whiny or deluded or anything like that, but speaking from what is a t least said in the video, I believe this to be the case.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/148 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.676 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I think we need a bit more proof that Gen Z is more conservative than Gen Y, as many in Gen Z aren't of voting \textbf{age} yet, but if that indeed turns out to be true, it may not be too surprising. American political preferences are actually quite cyclical, and, while on the whole folks become more conservative as they \textbf{age}, it's not true that older folks on the whole are more conservative tohan younger folks. A prime example: people in their 60s are actually more liberal than people in their 40s. While the former grew up fighting, in their opinion, an unjust war (Vietnam) and thus grew up more liberal, the latter grew up with the father of modern conservatism in the highest office. While people don't agree on whether Reagan was actually a successful president, many who were just starting to form their political opinions (so of \textbf{age} 18 or so) liked him. Coupled with the fact that Carter was not as popular, and that generation was more in line with conservative thought. Meanwhile, millennials grew up with a booming economy under a Democrat (Clinton), and a faltering economy, not to mention another, in their opinion, unjust war, under a Repiblican. The relative popularity of Obama and the prior points make it so that millennials are liberal on the whole. Gen Z likely will be as well, though the extent to which that's true depends on how the world looks while they're coming of \textbf{age}. If Trump continues to oversee a successful economy, we may have a generation of conservatives (though I question whether social conservatism will thrive in what is the first majority minority generation). However, if the economy tanks, or we get into a war, have some fear that Gen Z will overtake Gen Y on the liberal politics spectrum.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}4/304 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.316 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Obviously, your parents are liberals. Depending on how \textbf{old} you are your opinion can flip on a dime. My sister is 10 and she hated Trump but after literally 15-minute car ride she thought he was good. However, if you're older like teens and developing your own ideas I want you to please explain why he's \textbf{racist} and a \textbf{misogynist}. Prove to me any of his policies the past year has hurt \textbf{black} people and Hispanics who are citizens? Cause it looks like his new nationalist policies have actually helped poor blacks and Hispanics and whites keep and make jobs... Funny huh? Why would a \textbf{racist} do such a  thing when Obama was going around shutting down jobs making people lose them...How about women? He has a lot in his top branch of business in his company and he stated his favorite person to work with was a \textbf{woman}... A sexist won't work with the other \textbf{sex}. Now if you pull his \textbf{sexual} assault claims, I am in the notion of "innocent until proven guilty" so take Bill Cosby: I didn't judge him or call him a rapist until last month when he was convicted as guilty. Trump's accusers have done \textbf{nothing} for years and years and let it drop for (potentially I don't know of course) fame and the spotlight. Why do you think his \textbf{sexual} accusers dropped dramatically after election night: Now yes he has one case in the courts right now and Stormy Daniels (which is consensual), well have to see what the courts state. Then school shooters... Oh boy, when you wake up and see "Hey it's the people that are the issue, not guns" we can move forward. But no, everyone in the Socialist Democrat camp is saying ban guns when that isn't the issue. Obviously, the rise of technology has contributed to the rise of school shootings and \textbf{mental} health. We should really look into that and educate parents to look after their kids and make them take breaks, go outside, and more. It's not gunning its people. Guns and the second amendment are put in place in case our government goes Russia 1918 or Chinese 1940s on our asses and we need to fight back. No to "protect us from robbers and hunt" that was on the side. The whole point is so if the US Government turns tyrannical that we can defend ourselves. Limiting guns of all sort won't stop the school shooters, they'll find knives, make pipe bombs, etc look at the UK murder rates... Sure gun violence is down but they are the knife capital of the world. Criminals and sick people will find whatever they can to kill. (Tbh guns kill quicker so in a way it's better then someone stabbing you to death or being next to a bomb and bleeding out. Cuts out the suffering part a lot...)I am not saying you're wrong in our opinions. Just make sure your arguments have weight and you know what you're saying is backed up by facts... Not feelings. That's my main issues with Millennials/Democrats. All about the feelings before facts. "Why should we legalize weed? Cause it feels good and it's not bad" is a horrible argument vs "We should legalize it because it has a low death count, most gangs and criminals are related to weed so we can cut down the prison system, and we have cases in Colorado where the economy boomed." Saying, Trump, is a \textbf{racist} when his actions speak otherwise doesn't hold merit. It's really telling when you see him being nominated for the Global Peace Prize over North Korea or he can offer to cover people under DACA for more border security. Just to make you think my fellow American. :)\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Mental, Misogynist, Nothing, Old, Racist, Sex, Sexual, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}12/630 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.905 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Cause politics have a lot to do with generations. Both Gen Z and Millennials have been very political in a lot of ways. Millennials (on average) preach of "tolerance" and "diversity" and don't care if the job sucks or the movie (Star Wars: The Last Jedi) sucks as long as we represent everyone, SJW culture, think modern feminist are great, a huge push against hate speech like Count Dankula getting fined or censoring comedy to have Amy Schumer, and overall want everyone to get along with free education and healthcare and work together in a lovely little fantasy of globalism with rainbows and unicorns!Obviously, I am being dramatically unfunny, but someone will laugh. I wanted to make a point that is no surprise that Gen Z is growing up more conservative. They hate the SJW culture that their parents are leading and want to shut down borders to protect families because Europe is already fucked by Middle Eastern savages, edgier and getting in trouble for "hate speech" to prove how fucking stupid it is and treating Jordan Petterson like a fucking rock star. Gen Z is doing it because conservatism is the new counterculture. Why do you think Trump, someone who voted Democrat in the 1990s who (just like a fuck load of others, like Rosanna, Dave Rubin, and more) now voting Republican? The ideas of \textbf{old} conservative of being \textbf{racist} and sexist are dying but the sense of traditional values, a strong nationalistic identity, and overall not conforming to the \textbf{nationalism} narrative are still strong. Well... At least we can agree Gen Z and Millennials are the least \textbf{racist}/sexist generation of all time! Now we have a huge culture fight on where to go. Socialism/Communism or capitalism. \textbf{Nationalism} or globalism. Work or diversity quotas. Feminism or equality.

Basically, no matter what you call it, it is anything but the internet as we know it.Also, it took a while for the internet to get adopted on a global scale and become accessible, meaning the first time one could practically use the internet was around 1993 (though a stat says only 7 had access to the internet at that time). But then again, it was quite crude, and you couldn't really do much with it.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Millennials were born between 1980/81 to 1994. Millennials came of \textbf{age} by the time the new millennium, they remember 9/11, the Facebook, Myspace, \& Twitter users, the MP3/iPod era, grew up without cell phones \& advanced tech, they're the ones who voted Barack Obama into office for round 1, and they were greatly impacted by the Recession. That is the main indicator of distinguishing yourself as a millennials and gen Z. Gen Z grew up during the Recession, Millennials lives were affected by the Recession directly. The earliest of millennials were already in the work force at the time. The middle \& latest were either in, entering, or getting ready for college. Gen Z wasnt directly impacted by the Recession. They were children still in elementary to early high school at that time. Gen Z became adults when the Recession was over and after Obama already won his 2nd term. So if you turned 18 after 2012, you're Gen Z.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/160 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.625 \\  \hline

NOW she is considered silent generation because the cut off years changs. In about 10 years theyll start saying anyone born before between 84 and 2000 is a millennial and it will probably stay there. So ur probably a millennial. There are cross over gens too. Like ppl born in the late 70s are called Xennials. Then there are silent boomers. Ppl in their late 60s NOW. I think ull probably die a millennial not a gen z. Another guy on ted x said he believes its based on major events too. He says if ur young and u processed 9 11 as a major tragedy u are a millennial where as if u dont remember it ur a gen z. I think thats similar to baby boomers who may not have remembered D day but later on lived thru the terror of the cold war and the cuba missle crisis.

Debate has always been important, its the best way people can solve society problems and sometimes its the least popular idea that's the best.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Prism You are absolutely 100 wrong. Pornography is degrading, disgusting, and no amount of safe \textbf{sex} adverts or PSAs will change the inherently immoral nature of pornography and the consumption of pornography. Pornography changes the brain. Just like an addictive substance, consuming pornography causes a overwhelming release of dopamine (the 'feel-good' chemical) in the brain. Repeated use causes your brain's dopamine receptors to shut down, and fewer receptors cause a person to seek more exciting, violent, taboo, or hardcore forms of pornography. Over time it becomes more difficult to feel happy or good about anything except for when a person consumes pornography, and it actually shrinks your frontal lobe. By the way, serious substance abuse such as cocaine works the same exact way, because pornography is an addiction. In one of the most comprehensive studies on porn use ever conducted, researchers found that after being exposed to softcore \textbf{sexual} material, both men and women were significantly less happy with their partner's looks, willingness to try new \textbf{sex} acts, and \textbf{sexual} performance. Even being exposed to porn just once can make people feel less in love with their significant other. Your brain is always making pathways. Upon an experience which brings a blast of dopamine, your brain makes a neuro 'roadmap' to reach that same place. The complex reward system in your brain links the exciting, dramatized, new, strange, or even violent acts in pornography with 'feeling good.' Meanwhile your brain dissociates 'feeling good' with things like cuddling or intimacy because those things don't bring the same blast of dopamine. As a result, regular turn-ons like kissing and touching or human connection don't work, and you can only become aroused by the raw, loveless, and sometimes abusive actions in pornography. In fact, excessive consumption of pornography can lead to \textbf{sexual} dysfunction in men, including a decreased \textbf{sex} drive and erectile dysfunction, especially in young men. While men can experience chronic ED as a result of blocked blood vessels, heart disease, or diabetes, about 15-20 of ED problems in teens and young men can be attributed to porn consumption.  Pornography falsely represents \textbf{sex} and women. The majority of women employed in the porn industry are paid based on their body and how they visually respond to what's being done to them. These women often get plastic surgery or are photoshopped into having a body deemed 'sexy.'  Those exposed to pornography often hold an unrealistic expectation of \textbf{sex} and their partners, and they become unhappy with either their or their partner's bodies. Women have scars, stretch marks, signs of \textbf{age}, cellulite, \textbf{fat}, asymmetrical bodies, uneven breasts, body hair, wrinkles, bags under their eyes, \textbf{chubby} necks and thighs, thick ankles, ugly feet and hands, etc. People, especially teens exposed to porn associate women structured like Barbies with either all women or \textbf{sexual} pleasure itself, changing the brain's view of arousal and physical beauty. Porn also depicts women who always enjoy \textbf{sexual} acts, even the violent or abusive ones. A \textbf{woman} can be degraded horribly in disgusting, revolting, torturous, and painful ways, but they are taught to act sexually satisfied or simply accept what is happening. Teens learn from this that women should like everything that is done to them and that they are objects of pleasure. Porn does not depict a \textbf{woman}'s attractive personality, her quirks or sense of humor or the internal things that make her gorgeous. Porn does not show anything but visual and sometimes audio cues, completely lacking the real human experience of smell, touch, and conversation. Real healthy relationships are built on respect, love, equality, honesty, and communication, and real \textbf{sex} includes mistakes, awkwardness, and humor as much as it does intimacy, physical attraction, and being turned on. A video might last 45 minutes, but it could take 3 days to shoot, showing none of the breaks or real life consequences of such treatment. Pornography misrepresents \textbf{sex}, women, and relationships and changes your mind to accept inhumane and unacceptable acts.  People in the porn industry suffer. Shelley Lubben is an ex-porn star and is founder and president of The Pink Cross Foundation. Her mission is to offer financial and emotional support to porn-stars who want out, those struggling with pornography, and those victims of pornography:  In statements I have received from females and males working in the pornography industry and those who previously worked in the industry, at least 80 admit to catching an STD while working in the California pornography industry. I personally caught the non-curable disease Genital Herpes in 1994 and was not given any information or help from porn producers or the adult industry. (…) Tanya Burleson, formerly known as Jersey Jaxin, caught Chlamydia her first year working. She exclaimed, while speaking with me, 'I don't believe I worked with one person who didn't at one time have an STD.' Tanya made over 200 movies in her three year career. She also says, 'Performers have to pay for their own testing, their medicine and lose at least eight days of work every time they catch a sexually transmitted disease.' Agents also lie to women in the adult industry and lure them into prostitution. Porn Star Erin Moore says, 'some agents lie to the girls and tell them they are shooting a scene when instead they set up prostitution acts for them.'   Porn actress Erin Moore admits, 'the drugs we binged on were Ecstasy, Cocaine, Marijuana, Xanax, Valium, Vicodin and \textbf{alcohol}.' Tanya Burleson, formerly known as Jersey Jaxin, says, 'Guys are punching you in the face. You get ripped. Your insides can come out of you. It's never ending. You're viewed as an object—not as a human with a spirit. People do drugs because they can't deal with the way they're being treated.' In one study 100 of the strippers reported some kind of physical or verbal abuse on their jobs. Verbal abuse by customers is extremely \textbf{common} with 91 reporting incidents. They were routinely called degrading names. Besides the verbal abuse, all endured some type of physical abuse on the job. Despite the fact that it is illegal to touch a stripper, strippers reported that customers grabbed them by the arm (88), grabbed their breast (73), or their buttock (91). Customers at strip clubs often assault the women. Customers pulled their hair (27), pinched them (58), slapped them (24), or bit them (36).  Porn is linked to \textbf{sex} trafficking and prostitution Obviously, human trafficking is an underground business, making firm statistics hard to come by. But the   facts in cases that come to light are chilling. For example, in 2011, two Miami men were found guilty of spending five years luring women into a human trafficking trap. They would advertise modeling roles, then when women came to try out, they would drug them, kidnap them, rape them, videotape the violence, and sell it to pornography stores and businesses across the country.  That same year a couple in Missouri was charged with forcing a mentally \textbf{handicapped} girl to produce porn for them by beating, whipping, suffocating, electrocuting, drowning, mutilating, and choking her until she agreed. One of the photos they forced her to make ended up on the front cover of a porn publication owned by Hustler Magazine Group. Those cases are just the tip of the iceberg; many more like them exist, and for each victim discovered, countless others suffer in silence. In a study of 854 women in prostitution across nine countries, 49 said that porn had been made of them while they were in prostitution, and 47 said they had been harmed by men who had either forced or tried to force their victims to do things the men had seen in porn.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Chubby, Common, Fat, Handicapped, Sex, Sexual, Woman, alcohol & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Behavioural Addiction - Alcohol, Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments, Physical Identity - Physical Features, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}20/1278 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.565 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small LanceAllott The most successful Internet porn sites and films are those that discover new ways to humiliate and inflict cruelty on women. In the Web site Slut Bus, women are lured into a van, offered money for \textbf{sex}, filmed having \textbf{sex}, and then dumped on the side of the road. Money is held out toward the \textbf{woman} as the van pulls away. She is always left without payment. The message is clear. Chris Hedges, Empire of Illusion: The End of Literacy and the Triumph of Spectacle.  (via thetuffmuff).......Pornography has functioned as a method to motivate, orchestrate, justify, and guide \textbf{sexual} abuse and violence against women. While there are important questions to be asked about how this happens, there can be no doubt that pornography has effects in the world… Dines, G., Jensen, B. and Russo, A. 2013 'Consumption of Pornography and Harm', in Dines, G. (ed), Pornography the Production and Consumption of Inequality, Taylor and Francis, Hoboken p. 29   ......In porn, the women's lack of human qualities often results in an inability to see just how violent the \textbf{sex} is. No matter how cruel the \textbf{sex}, the one question I can always count on hearing from a man after my presentation is, 'Women enjoy doing what they are doing, so why is porn a problem?' Of course, these men have no empirical evidence to support this, just their observations of the porn they masturbate to. When I ask them if they would like to see their wives, girlfriends, or sisters in their position — in an attempt to humanize the porn performers — they are quick to respond that their loved ones are different from the women in porn; their women would never 'choose' such a job. The image these men seem to have of women in porn is of a \textbf{woman} accidentally stumbling onto a porn set one day, and realizing that this is what she has been looking for all her life -Gail Dines, 'Pornland: How Porn Has Hijacked Our Sexuality,'\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Sex, Sexual, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}7/333 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.102 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small LanceAllott 'There are very heart breaking and horrible  things about the pornographic world. But, most of those things happened  to actresses and actors long before they arrived in the pornography  world. The pornography industry is just a place where a lot of victims  relive their abuse, where they can continue to destroy themselves like  their abusers destroyed them. That's what is the most disturbing to me.  The incest, rapes, child abuse and neglect that become the springboard  for a lot of participants to enter the industry. People in the industry  will tell you this isn't true, but I learned everything to the contrary.  This excuse makes it easier to go to work, that's all.' Interviewed by IFQ, Shick Garcia also said that, and 'I consider  those scenes [of double and triple penetration] as real "hardcore'  […]. Other girls had to do worse. Starting with double vaginal  penetration, double anal penetration, then both at the same time.

Imagine a girl with no experience, not speaking the  [same] language, far away from her home, sleeping at a hotel or on the  set. She's got to do a double penetration, a vaginal fisting, along with  an anal fisting, sometimes both at the same time, a hand up her ass,  sometimes two. At the end, you've got a girl in tears who's pissing  blood because of lesions, and who generally shits herself because noboby  explained to her that she needed to have an enema.[…] After the scene  which they are not allowed to interrupt, and anyway \textbf{nobody} listens to  them, the girls get two hours to rest.

Also, yes, most guys at my school also played sports, played video games (at the time it was Wow and Counter Strike probably), watched YouTube, talked to girls, and slept in class too...just like every generation of high school kids did...you're not a special \textbf{snowflake} because you did something that literally everyone else of every other generation did (minus of course, YouTube and playing video games since those weren't around for those other generations). Moreover, hundreds of thousands of Gen Z kids DID in fact go to anti-gun rallies and demonstrations - both during that March for Our Lives march, and at their schools, and then complained if their principals didn't want to allow such demonstrations to take place, for fear of inciting more shootings, since there would be kids outside of school, creating open targets for any other would-be school shooters...but of course, in true Gen Z fashion, your generation whined and went to social media (because of course you would) to demonize your principals and say "LALALALALA WE DON'T HEAR YOU" instead of actually LISTENING to the LEGITIMATE concerns the adults (Millennials and Gen X, along with some of the Forgotten Generation people) had.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Snowflake & \cellcolor{green!5} Ideological and Political Identity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/256 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.391 \\  \hline
