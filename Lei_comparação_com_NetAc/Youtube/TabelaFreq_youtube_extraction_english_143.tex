  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I don't get how it's \textbf{ageist} to say "pass the torch", I do think it was a desperate statement but Swalwell isn't wrong as boomers and older have been in power forever and are aging rapidly, meanwhile you have the younger generation who're going to HAVE to take the torch at some point and are not being given as much opportunity to run things and get more experience. Boomers have clogged the hole and now gen x, millenials and gen z are stuck having to wait for them to retire (which a good portion aren't doing) or die off (as harsh a that sounds).I'm a Bernie  supporter and plan on voting for him or Warren in the primary but I have to disagree with him here; there's a difference between someone dismissing a 35 year \textbf{old} for being inexperienced versus 70+ people who aren't going to live to see the consequences of climate change or the debt we'll be saddled with, we need to be able to start running things.This also ignores that Biden has an \textbf{old}-school mentality which needs to go away.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Ageist, Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}2/185 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.081 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Bernie is right on the \textbf{age} issue and Swalwell should have known better.  If you're going to talk about your generation, then talk about the new generation of leadership.  Period.  Swalwell missed a crucial point of JFK's line about the torch being passed, which he was grabbing on to.  JFK made the assertion AFTER he had been elected and inaugurated.  He didn't say the torch should be passed, but that it had been passed. The 1960 election had made that a fact.   Indeed, both Nixon and he were of a younger generation from FDR, Truman and \textbf{Ike}.  After Swalwell is president (which won't be 2021, it looks like) he can make a comment like that in a positive way, as Kennedy did.  For this campaign, it was a clumsy and heavy-handed attempt to make Biden and Bernie look unfit for the Oval Office just because of their \textbf{age}.  What Swalwell could have done is to ask Bernie by what percent middle-class taxes would have to go up to pay for Medicare for All and by what percentage insurance premiums and medical costs would come down after an eight-year Sanders presidency.  Has Bernie ever stated those numbers?  If taxes go up 3.7 and costs come down 8.2, well, we should just hold the election tomorrow, because Bernie wins in a landslide.  On the other hand, how many Americans fear that what will happen is that taxes will go up 3.7 and costs will come down 0.3 or even continue rising for some years, not because the idea of national health insurance is bad, but because the plan to require everyone to convert from private insurance to government insurance is faulty?\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Ike & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Religious Identity - Jewish & \cellcolor{green!5}3/279 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.075 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small You are missing the part about people not having to pay any premiums to health insurance companies.  To say that the out of pocket costs would do down by any percentage you quoted makes no sense. Bernie said this in 2016 but not often enough to get the message across.  I'm not understanding what your costs coming down 8.2 even means.  I know you meant to be hypothetical but it seems to me that the costs out of pocket would come down 100 if co-pays, deductibles and premiums are obliterated. Please explain because I'm not an expert on this issue. The only costs would be an increase in taxes.  Bernie needs to spell this out a bit better so people actually get it.  I don't think that people understood in 2016 and do not understand now that they wouldn't have any  of the current costs they currently have to pay.  But the GOP was afraid that people would figure this out. We know this because they attacked the health care systems  in other western countries and made bogus claims against them.  Most of that was fabricated or were isolated, anecdotal incidents and atypical.  People here were asked to ignore their OWN experience with our health care system---clinic wait times (notice how the mini clinics in stores and malls have sprouted up all over?), denial of care by the insurance companies, exponentially increasing premiums, having to change \textbf{doctors} because your employer's insurance changed, etc. etc.  Most of us have had at least one of those happen.  That message was not broadcast enough but unfortunately, the negative stuff was, most of which was not true. This is one issue that boggles my mind because I knew ,as you stated,  that if anyone actually thought about it, it's a no brainer.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}doctors & \cellcolor{green!27}Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/298 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.336 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Dakoda Sanders Bernie has been on the same wave, because he has \textbf{nothing} else. Here's my thing about his signature issue, healthcare. Do I believe that healthcare is a human right? ABSOLUTELY! Do I believe that everyone in the U.S. should have access to affordable healthcare? WITHOUT QUESTION. HOWEVER, let that healthcare be what every individual thinks works for them, not one set system that was set up by a guy who has beef, though warranted in many cases, with the private insurance industry. He even said that YES taxes would be raised, but never gave a number/percentage of how what it would be raised to. That should raise some eyebrows. What if that percentage is something that could effect someone paycheck more that they expected? Here's the reality. IF, and that's a strong if, Bernie gets elected, DO NOT THINK that he will walk into the White House, snap his fingers, and make this happen. The negotiations for this would go back and forth well into, if not dominate his entire first term. Ultimately, there will be a lot of compromises, and I can GUARANTEE that many of his most staunch supporters will turn on him? Why? Because he talked a good game when he was senator, but realized that the games changes when you become President.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!27}1/218 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.459 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Brent Foster Firat: Let's deal with why he says no to private insurance, you know what is a private company's judicial responsibility?  Maximizing profit! If a CEO does anything other than for maximizing the profit of a business he can be held liable in court. Meaning that no Private insurance is going to keep your interest at mind, and your interest, need I remind you, is staying alive. So first you don't privatize healthcare like it's an iphone. It's not a luxary provided by a free market, it's a necessity, provided by wait for it , ........ DRUMS........ SOCIALISSSMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM. Which by definition means people pooling together for the \textbf{common} good of society. You know what else is not private and is socialized? Police, why? cuz regardless of your income you need their help. So if you leave healthcare to private market, here is what happens, they accept all the healthy people by offering very low prices while rejecting and unloading all the sick people into the public system which means profit for them, bankruptcy for our country and our sick people. Bernie says no I won't play this game with Brent's life. That's number 1. BTW healthcare itself is a socialist idea. No other major country treats healthcare as a commodity. 2, Well let's say I'm your avg Joe: My employer wont give me a raise because he is paying \textbf{crazy} money for my insurance already. Likely, I'm underinsured with high deductable and copayments and premiums, so far I'm not winning with your system. But get this, Pharma charges me 2 times of that of a Canadian, or a French, why? They have power, while we paid for the research behind the drug they are selling us btw. , So I'm not really insured because maybe my deductible is \$1000 and I'm part of the majority of Americans one 500 dollar bill away from bankruptcy. So how is this working so far? Bernie says hey Imma change the law and negotiate prices, and all of us will pay through a single payer which has more leverage over negotiations with Big Pharma, saving you drug money, while I'm actually giving you a "Cadilac" plan with no deductibles, no waiting, and bureaucracy, No co-payments, no premiums, just a bit more in taxes and your employer can also give you a raise now.  Our people have to call their insurance to see if they can go to their \textbf{doctors}, Canadians call their \textbf{doctors} for that. We can have that same situation here. 3, he is the few candidates in over 200 years in this country who know how to get things done. And he never says imma compromise and make a deal with them, he says I need you to get involved if you want change, and we know that he will be the first president who will stand up to any big power with courage, be it Establishment Ds or Rs, be it top 1, be it corporations Be it the pharma, be it the big agriculture, be it insurance companies, be it wall st, be it fossil fuel companies, be it military-industrial complex.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Meaningful Existence Thank you for continuing to post this. As someone who has been on Medicare now for 2 years, I wish people would talk more about the supplemental insurance we almost all have to purchase in addition to the Medicare Part B dollars that come out of our SS check. Plus, the fees and co-pays and deductibles still exist.  I understand that it's still cheaper but the health insurance industry has basically co-opted the Medicare system now as well.  Slowly but surely over time, Medicare is being privatized and most people haven't noticed!  We need to actually call it for what it is!  I haven't heard any candidate say this.Â  Prior to this year, we had Cost Plans, Advantage Plans and Medigap Plans.  Last year, they eliminated the Cost plans and I don't know why exactly.  I haven't been successful in finding out a good explanation for it. The reason provided didn't make sense to me but I suspect the Cost Plans had to be eliminated for the wholesale takeover to happen.Â  The premiums this year for these Advantage systems range from very little (under \$50) a month to really expensive, in the hundreds of dollars a month.  Of course, the deductibles and co-pays are higher for the cheaper plans but for someone who is reasonably healthy, those are a good option.  Add this to the money deducted from SS and the premiums can be quite high for people living on a fixed income. I realize that this is a lot cheaper than many people have to pay in this country.  My complaint isn't necessarily about the dollars but rather how the insurance companies have been allowed to syphon off dollars from what is a Fed program by providing "Medicare benefits."  I also know why we have to purchase these plans---because Medicare by itself doesn't cover what \textbf{doctors}, hospitals and clinics charge for services.  My point is that we are all in the same boat whether one is on Medicare, employer provided insurance or self-purchase.  When I received my Medicare book last fall, I counted 29 pages with 11 different products on a page. That's 319 options and I'm not even counting the Medigap plans!  It's extremely complicated and took me many hours over several days to figure out which plan to choose.  I had to compare provider networks, drug formularies, co-pays, deductibles, drug costs, etc.  And I'm a social worker who used to help clients on occasion do this but it's gotten much more complex with each passing year. There is a new industry whose sole purpose is to help people choose the best plan based on their individual circumstances. This is ridiculous and I don't believe anyone should have to go through this. The Feds have basically handed over Medicare to the insurance companies now and we all should be screaming about it.  It's a cash cow for them as the baby boomers have retired or will be retiring in the near future.  No one talks about it and I haven't heard Bernie mention this either. Note: I believe that this is one reason why people at Trump rallies held signs that said "Keep your hands off my Medicare."  Many of us thought that was stupid at the time.  Didn't they know that Medicare was a Federal program?  I understand better now why those people felt threatened at losing their health insurance because to them, Medicare IS their supplemental or Medigap insurance company.  It's still private insurance as far as they are concerned because they pay a premium to the private insurance company every month!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}doctors & \cellcolor{green!5}Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/598 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.167 \\  \hline

Cut prescription drug prices in half, with the Prescription Drug Price Relief Act, by pegging prices to the median drug price in five major countries: Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Japan.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Mental, doctors & \cellcolor{green!5}Nationality - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}2/368 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.543 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small It's odd when some of these johnny-come-lately politicians who \textbf{nobody} heard of three or four years ago start saying that Bernie's too \textbf{old} when these very same people are talking about the very same things that Senator Sanders was advocating when the media thought he was \textbf{crazy}. How can you see this as anything but agist and hypocritical?Mainstream media you gotta give us a break. Your constant attacks and dismissal of Sanders is not honest.

Then I'll be dull and stay with the \textbf{old} guy.  Seriously Bernie has been staying on the same message for 40 years.  I like that he's consistent.  Kamala Harris is corporate af.
