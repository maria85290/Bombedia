If she is, indeed, thinking that white people are the reason for the inexplicable amount of arbitrary killing in \textbf{black} communities, then, whats more tear-worthy is the fact that she is surrounded by people who are lying to her. Don't teach her that she should be asking whites, or any other \textbf{ethnicity}, for an answer to her questions, because it's wrong to imply that, and we don't understand it either.

Humans are quite the trivial species we continue to do stupid shit despite it not working. Were an insane species. 1. Every \textbf{race}:\textbf{black}, white, asian, hispanic, etc can be rascist. 2. There are laws in place that make rascism illegal. However theres also a thing called freedom of speech. So if someone makes a crack at your \textbf{race} its on their conscience. The only true time it should matter is when they tread upon your human rights. People say stupid shit. Debate what they say in a civilized manner. (It makes your cause appear more worthy and thus attract more individuals) or dont debate at all and continue on with life. 3. \textbf{black} lives do matter. But so do all lives. 4. Dont play the victim card. Your ancestors were treated as slaves. However so were alot of peoples. Remember them but dont play it as if your ancestors are you. You and them are seperate individuals. Unless YOU were abused physically to the extent they were then you have no right to say we have been slaving for the white man. Etc.etc. because you havnt.5. Feel free to dispute my points. Just do it civilized im sick of petty arguments. Humans need to wise up before were our own undoing....The girls brave.

I mean when is this hamster wheel gonna stop ...Control our kids give them love...

Where did I even imply this kid is less than?! Where i come from you back your words or stfu, you should do the latter. And Ive seen first hand how blacks torture mixed \textbf{race} peers (especially high school), so again, if you think that people are still afraid to disagree with blacks and get called \textbf{racist}, you need a reality check because when thugs like brown get shot and blacks destroy, loot THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES to show how "scared" of "\textbf{racist}" policemen and whites they're, \textbf{nobody} sees you as a victim.Its always easy to blame others for your mistakes, unhappy life, bad grades etc when everyone is responsible for their own life!
