  \cellcolor{green!27}\small What is anti-\textbf{black} \textbf{racism}.  It is just \textbf{racism}.  But I do see that whites are trying to change the definition so that it is not just them under this umbrella.  \textbf{Racism} is the systemic  power and control of one \textbf{race} over another.  \textbf{Black} and brown people have no power or control over any one.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The Prof. is right when he mentions the urban dwellings called "Projects". Those buildings were originally built for white urban residents, hence "project", but were in a sense waived because of FHA loans given to WHITE families to buy homes in the NEW suburbs.

No other group in the history of the world has done more to stamp out oligarch slave trading than European Christians. The oligarch agenda is anti-European and anti-Christianity. \textbf{Nothing} else. The prayer is for dumbed down society to wake up and realize they are being used and are blindly taking the bait...because of fake news like this.The only people that are truly \textbf{racist} are the oligarchs.

I could easily say the same thing about you but I'm not because it's just debate.Even to say that you'll get all \textbf{black} people in America to join one political party is a far stretch. You're talking about tens of millions of individuals with their own thought processes. Some will be on board yes but many others will just want to keep building up the Republicans and the Democrats, you know how it is. Even the alternative \textbf{black} party would be subject to infiltration and then it would split up and both or more factions would claim to be the legit movement and on and on. Because multiracial America is the long-term agenda, and that can't be achieved as efficiently if races are against eachother politically. For starters the \textbf{black} vote, even with 100 turnout, wouldn't be enough to win. There's about 50 million \textbf{black} Americans compared to 250+million white Americans, that's 5 white voters to every 1 \textbf{black} voter. That won't do.

The reservations are DUMPING GROUNDS for toxic chemicals, mining tailings, and nuclear waste...I can go on if you would like.Now the term environmental \textbf{racism} is a modern MADE-UP term to to help with DEFLECTING blame from corporations who do so under the radar and paying off corrupt government officials. To JUST bring up ONE demographic only is SHEER ignorance. There are MANY demographics that are affected by it NOT JUST \textbf{BLACK}  it about those who have no voice or are ignorant to being used for profiteering corporations, politicians and others.This story is a good one HOWEVER it focuses on just one demographic and IGNORES all other nuances of corruption caused by the elites towards the uninformed people no matter WHAT demographic they belong to.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Racism & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/149 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.342 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The problem is, in terms of teaming up, personally is when too many blacks or whites are grouped up, it typically offsets the opposite into not wanting to be involved and that, in my opinion, is the major damage of \textbf{racism}. Because inherently , the white voice is much louder than the \textbf{black} voice. Now my question is, how do we fix this directly without sacrificing a life(primarily a \textbf{black} life being lost in the hands of whites).
