\hline\cellcolor{green!27}\small I'm in New Zealand and I have only recently found your channel. I'm about to hit forty and feel like only now am I learning about how to have fun with my make up and that's thanks to you. While I won't always do a dramatic look, you have showed me how to when I have time and for that I thank you ü§ó. All the make up brands here that target the more mature person think that you just have to look super natural with no colour or shimmer. I think we should all fight the \textbf{ageism} in the industry. As it is only in the last few years that I have had the means to buy really good quality make up. But I have to go looking for it and even when I approach the local Mac counter they still seem surprised that I want one of their products. They seem to have the impression that I would go to one of the counters that intentionally caters for my \textbf{age} group whether they have products I want or not.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Ageism & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/181 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.105 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Yes! We do need to push back and change \textbf{ageism} . If our \textbf{age} group does not buy as much, perhaps it is because older women are fed the message that they are over the hill and don't see themselves reflected in the cosmetic and fashion industry. We should contact both companies and influencers and make our voice heard. Thank you for this video! Women 'of a certain \textbf{age}' unite and fight this. Yes there are other issues, but other issues already have platforms, \textbf{ageism} in fashion industry does not.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Ageism & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/90 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.333 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Definitely don't accept it.  Start by giving feedback to UD and any other companies that do invite you on how they could make their events different.  They could have demos or speakers along with social event.  The younger participants can go to a club and others can choose a lower key cocktail hour.  In your videos, add content mentioning how a company may or may not be featuring older women in their ad campaigns.  Continue to tailor your content to your demographic.  I just found The YouTube beauty community when I stopped coloring my hair and knew I needed to refresh my look.  Since I come to YT for other how to videos, I came here for makeup advice and was totally blown away.  In the last six months I have spent more on makeup than in the last 5 years total.  As the younger influencers \textbf{age} things will change as they change but you don't have to wait for it.  I will do my part to share my favorite channels with in my circle.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/175 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.571 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I am pretty new to watching You Tube videos, and from what I can see, these brands are using influencers and social media as their major source of advertising and marketing‚Äî and I imagine‚Äî- although I'm guessing‚Äî it costs them a lot less than print ads or TV commercials.  I think the twenty-somethings are the demographic most heavily influenced by what they see others doing or looking like on social media, so it's all about the numbers for the cosmetic companies.  Cha-ching\$ .  We more mature women are more experienced, know what we like and don't ,  and are less likely to fall for a line of advertising crap‚Äî‚Äî even though we have a whole lot more disposable income than we did in our twenties. I think we should always push back on companies and make ourselves heard. I thought your video was very honest and informative‚Äî-like all of your videos, which I appreciate very much. Many others that I've seen seem like \textbf{nothing} more than a product commercial.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small First I have to say you are beautiful your makeup looks great \textbf{age} appropriate but then you're still at the \textbf{age} where you could wear \textbf{crazy} makeup like the eyeliner that goes out Beyond the edge of your eye Etc enjoy all that while you can because when you get older you can't get away with that at all that's said... Sorry I have to agree to disagree 40 simply is not mature skin there's a difference between lines and wrinkles. I expected when I clicked on these last two links I got the original from McGillicutty I believe her name and yes she has mature skin but you other two ladies the other ladies 50 and I guess you're 40? it's just NOT mature skin yet so this tells me that the Cosmetic industry the that includes moisturizers eye creams Etc has really made you guys feel like you're way older than you are because they're promoting a thirteen-year-\textbf{old} as the model as a mature skin person I'm 61 when I was 40 I had lines I DIDN'T HAVE WRINKLES I am a natural blond natural blondes do \textbf{age} faster because of the pigment of our skin! But yeah when I see a product that supposed to be an anti-aging line and they've got a 13 to 20 year \textbf{old} as the model I simply don't buy their product simple as that because it SCREAMS to me it is NOT an anti-aging line at all it's a gimmick!! But you YOUNGER LADIES ENJOY THOSE YEARS you're NOT \textbf{OLD} AT 40 in any way shape or form hell I'm not \textbf{old} at 61!!! Thanks for sharing but please quit letting cosmetic companies make you feel decades older than you actually are don't buy into the hype!!! PS I do still keep up my appearance I still wear makeup but I had to totally start reapplying makeup totally different then I'd wore all my life I had to do away with the \textbf{black} eyeliner and the dark brown eyeshadows I simply looked like a clown or a street walker LOL I guess I was around 49 to 51 when I had to change up the way I applied makeup! Me personally I just had lines and deeper line tell about the \textbf{age} of 56 57 is when I started getting actual wrinkles and yes of course they should invite people that are much older if they're promoting an anti-aging line people much older than yourself people in their 60s but that's never going to happen there's one model that I know of in her 60s but that's only one and Lauren Huntin used to she was a big-time model in the 80s and she did come back at 48 I think and she did show covers where they were putting the same makeup as in her 20s and she did look like a clown so that's when she came up with her own line of makeup\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Black, Crazy, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - Black, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}9/495 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.818 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I couldn't agree more with this, I truly believe we shouldn't just except THIS. We do need to get more of us to get together and contact these brands. I will try to do my part!!! This really hit me. Because I just said yesterday that I'm done trying to get into the makeup world because I'm always being told that I've never worn makeup my entire life and being 46 I need to stay away from it now.  Sorry I was busy being a full-time worker, a wife, raising two kids so I didn't worry about my appearance but now the kids r grown, moved out and starting their own families.  I've always had a desire to play with makeup just never cared that much but thinking that I have done my job, everyone has moved on that maybe now I can do things for me and I want/wanted to learn and play with makeup but being told time and time again that I'm to \textbf{old}, look like a clown etc I threw in the towel and said u won, I won't buy any, watch videos anymore and just sit here. But this video has just made me want to fight back and tell them all to go see if it's snowing lol and let me have a life and enjoy something that's just for ME. Sorry if I'm not making sense. Thank you for bringing this subject up and helping me rethink things.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small You and Melissa m are so right. These companies should be paying some more attention to the more mature \textbf{age} group.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small First of all, I thought you were in your 20's, no BS. The twenty something might be a dinner invite, but can't afford these very expensive products. Most have entry level jobs  ( \textbf{nothing} wrong with that, that's where you get your foot in the door, and work your butt off, like we did)  its our \textbf{age} group that have more disposal income, and rely on you to get out the truth about an expensive product. This allows us to make informed decisions about a product based on our skin type. If these yahoos were smart, that'd court you to promote their products. Of course in our twenties we looked flawless, thats why I chuckle out loud when they're peddling an anti aging products..REALLY!!?   We'll push back with our all mighty dollar. Believe me, they take a better look whom has more purchasing power. Push back, wrong is wrong. Not only are we buying their expensive makeup, we buy more skin care. Remember the difference between 28 \& 40. Sixteenth short years. Keep up the hard work, and know you have many loud voices that actually buy this stuff with you. And these days about 9p is my bed time. And at this \textbf{age}, no apologies required or necessary. I love you and your great info! And yes, we can have more than one issues that is of concern.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I'm so with you. We have youth shoved in our faces every time we even think about trying that new foundation or new palette. One must wonder who is buying the 20 year olds makeup. I know the big influences probably don't pay a dime. But. . . . They to, one day will be our \textbf{age} group and then what? Are we allowing the big brands to push up to the back seat and hope we get a crumb to show that we are still beautiful and amazing people. Honestly I feel that if the brands would market and showcase mature women, that they may just make a lot more money. Not to mention they wouldn't have to spend all that money on bites and \textbf{alcohol} until 3:00am. I'm a \textbf{nobody} trying to dip my big toe in this vast YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, influencer world and it's not looking very promising. I'm all for standagainstageism.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Ageism is very real and alive in this industry and I never realized it until I started a channel. I am almost 50 and decided to start a channel not only to have fun with my teen daughter, but because I had such difficulty finding reviews for products I was interested in learning more about. And, let's face it, products apply differently to mature skin than they do to younger skin. I don't know about you, but I was tired of watching reviews, seeing this beautiful product applied to a 20 year-old, purchasing it, applying it and having a completely different response. Because I had always received such wonderful treatment at the retail locations I shopped at (Nordstrom's treats me like gold), I never knew that women my \textbf{age} were devalued in thus industry. If anything, it was my (false) belief that mature women were highly valued, as that had been my retail experience. Boy, did I have a shock when I started my channel! I quickly realized that mature women were, for the most part, completely disregarded. And I don't understand it. At all. Not only do women our \textbf{age} have a significant amount of experience working with these products (so we know a good, bad and ugly), but the demand is high for reviews and demos by women our \textbf{age}. But, you're right - our channels are completely ignored and disregarded. We are rarely included in PR and, you are completely right, personally, I have NEVER witnessed an influencer my \textbf{age}, or close to my \textbf{age}, invited to any event. Even the brands that have traditionally catered to the mature audience (luxury brands) disregard reviewers our \textbf{age}. Since I've had this experience, I am determined to make change. If men can be widely accepted in the industry, then women OF ALL AGES should be, as well. As it currently stands, our \textbf{age} group (over 40, especially) is the only 'group' that is excluded. But they sure want our money... When I talk to younger influencers, and brands, who have the influence to make change, I pass along one thing - this may not affect you now, since you're younger, but it will as you \textbf{age}. Make change NOW, while it's not something that personally affects you so when you get to my \textbf{age}, it's no longer a concern. But, in my experience, most people tend not to care about issues that don't personally affect them. And what really stuns me? Most of these brands are RUN BY WOMEN OUR \textbf{AGE}! You would think that they would know, from first-hand experience, that women our \textbf{age} purchase, use and recommend their products! Thank you for speaking out on this, sweetie! It was truly a shock to me; to go from being treated like gold on the retail level, valued as a consumer, to being treated as if I'm \textbf{nothing} and my opinion is useless, at the social media level. We need to make change - women of ALL AGES are beautiful, most of us use makeup (I do even more now than when I was younger) and our voices should be heard! So, yes, we should push back and I would be happy to stand by your side, representing women my \textbf{age}! And, let me tell you, there is no way that brands have taken polls on women our \textbf{age} and our purchasing habits, reflecting this in their exclusions because every, single \textbf{woman} I know (my \textbf{age}) purchases more now than when we were younger. Not only do we have more of an interest in products, but we can now afford them.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small In 2018 where everyone is screaming that everyone should be inclusive in their brands and clothing lines and etcetera then why would it be Out Of Reach to have our maturing \textbf{age} men and women be included as well? I say that we stand up and say hey! We deserve to be included as well. Just because we are getting older doesn't mean that we are becoming more irrelevant against the younger ages. If anything as we get older and we fully know who we are as a person and as a member of society then we should be represented just as much as the beautiful young men and women are represented today in the media.

But then I'm 50, and even most of the women near my \textbf{age} or even a bit older that I watch have waaay more youthful looks than me. They're upfront that they've had fillers/botox/lasering, but I still find it depressing that I don't look as good. I just can't afford treatments or high-end skincare, I'm doing the best I can with drugstore. So even some of us older women feel inadequate when we compare ourselves to our peers.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Hi Risa,  I'm a newer subscriber and I'm really loving your channel. You ARE inspiring.  I think it will be interesting to see how things turn with this over the next several years.  Will the "hot" influencers of today still be thought of that way by these companies as they \textbf{age}? This demographic has grown up with all of the social media platforms- will they continue this into their 30s, 40s and 50s when they have (likely) less time yet more income?  We'll see I guess.  I'm really disappointed to hear how the UD event went- it seems like such a waste not to have someone talking about the brand's vision, product roadmap, etc.  I guess "selfie exposure" is what they were looking to accomplish.  That said, if they don't want this 40-something's money I'll remember that when shopping.

During the entire time I read soooo many of the women who posted here and all have such positive words not to mention they feel the same too. I agree with you 100 .  I'm 52 and struggled with \textbf{age} 2 years ago but I've always worn makeup but at that time had questioned the whole part of it. But I realized how it made me feel, or act, or how I could accomplish my day.  I LOVE AND LIVE makeup...I won't stop, I feel so good when I wear it.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Hi Risa,  Thank you for another Talk Tuesday.  I know I'm a week late but better late than never !  You know, this "\textbf{ageism}" is an interesting thing.  Yes, I do find that most makeup Youtube gurus out there are fairly young and they're very helpful, don't get me wrong, but one quickly realises that applying makeup on a 20 something year \textbf{old}, is totally different than applying makeup on a 40 something year \textbf{old}.  This is the reason why I like your Youtube channel, Risa !!!!!I had the biggest compliment given to me this past weekend where my sister-in-law, who was visiting, said that I always have such nice makeup and to teach her how to draw in her eyebrows.  Hello ..... me, give you a tutorial ?  I always talk about your Youtube channel and told her that I learned what I learned because of your channel.  Yes, I've always been interested in makeup/grooming and I also happen to feel that we only get one shot at life so if you like to wear makeup and feel like you're "slaying", then why not go for it, right ?!  I think that most of us who are in our 40's have become better with \textbf{age} because we're now watching Youtube and feeling confident that we know what to do.  I know more about makeup application at 49 than when I was in my early 20's - no doubt !I feel it would be short-sighted for cosmetic brands to focus solely on the younger generation rather than the full spectrum of ages.  There are pros and cons to both.  There might be a better financial bracket with the older generation than the younger, there could be a better makeup application on the younger and there could be merit to showing makeup application for the mature \textbf{woman} - who knows what the right answer is, right ?!  \textbf{Age} is only a number and if you like to feel coiffed and put together, I say "why not". I stand by you, Risa !  Thanks again for your videos.  While I may not get to them as efficiently as some, I always look forward to watching them.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Hi Risa!  I hope it's not too late for you to read my review.....if that Urban Decay get together lets say,  hypothetically had  100 middle aged people and a handful of 20 something ,  I guarantee the 20 something would be uncomfortable!  Everything is always geared toward the young yes, even if they don't have money they get it from their parents or may work hard.   Something about youth is beautiful of course but getting to live a long good life with wrinkles is beautiful also!  The Bible talks about not being concerned with what to wear or hair arrangement meaning there are much more important things in life!!  Our looks will fade but not Gods Word or His love for us!   I think we should care about how we look NO matter what \textbf{age} we are if we are capable of doing so!  I'm in my middle 50's and still care very much about taking care of myself physically and internally!   And hope to until I no longer can or die.  In the "End Times"  which is OUR "End Times"  The Bible talks about how people will be selfish and think higher of themselves.   I remember my \textbf{senior} picture was seen by a \textbf{woman} and she called to see if I was interested in selling Mary Kay.  (Just by the way I looked)  even if I didn't use the products.  I said I wasn't interested.   DON'T STOP DOING WHAT YOU  ARE DOING!  I love all your videos!  You look amazing for your \textbf{age} but we will ALL get older and it should be a privilege not a burden!  I have felt the way you're feeling many times, but realize it is what it is!  It is sad that most things are geared toward the young.  I do see a few commercials geared to older women and makeup that you would have not seen a year ago!  This is a quote I will always remember........"it is better to light one candle than to curse the darkness " You are making a difference and I love you my friend ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ I'm NOT going to hide my light and love for people as long as I live!   There is so much more I could say but  I hope you know it's from my heart!  I believe in you Risa and MANY of your subscribers do TOO!

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Risa, I really like the meat of what you have expressed here and think it's an important topic. As regards the other "isms"  I think what you are saying is that we cannot fight every battle that comes our way, but must pick and choose.  I agree, however, I think it is important to note that \textbf{racism}, for example, is everyone's battle in that if affects all of us regardless of color.  It is incumbent upon those of us seated comfortably within our white privelege to speak up about the lack of inclusion within the makeup industry or to support brands that are inclusive or owned by WOC, whether or not we feel these things directly influence our lives.  In the end, marginalizing people always affects the whole, whether it is older women on YT, WOC or any underrepresented group.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Racism & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/140 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.714 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I am a new subscriber to your channel and I have to tell you I am inspired by you. I am more confident bc of watching your unique talents that address issues I am confronted by. I am a 60+ \textbf{woman} so totally understand the problems with the beauty industry you address in this video. When I was younger (in my 20s, 30s and 40s) I loved dressing up and wearing makeup. I wouldn't even go out to the mailbox without makeup on. Then when I hit my late 40s I was diagnosed with a chronic auto-immune disease. My whole life changed and I became very depressed. I had always carefully maintained my figure but I began to gain a great deal of weight bc of my illness and the depression. I stopped caring about the clothes I wore and started going without makeup. But the funny thing was it didn't make me feel better it only made me feel worse about myself bc it wasn't who I was. I decided something had to be done before I was unrecognizable so I slowly began to lose weight. It took me two plus years but I lost over 100 lbs. That really helped spark me. I started taking an interest in my appearance again since I was forced to buy all new clothes. I began buying more stylish and attractive clothing not in my usual grays, navys and blacks but in pretty vibrant colors. Than I realized I needed to do something with my hair and makeup or the new clothes would look strange on me. Like I was one person from the neck down and another from the neck up. So I started watching YouTube makeup videos since times had changed and what used to be in was now out. But I noticed all the channels I watched were by individuals in their late teens to early 20s. We had \textbf{nothing} in \textbf{common}. I had wrinkles and uneven skin tone, sags and very hooded eyes. Where had they come from? The ppl I was watching had flawless, unwrinkled skin with maybe an occasional breakout. Watching them only made me feel bad about myself again. So I unsubscribed those channels and slowly began finding YouTubers who were more my \textbf{age} and addressed my needs. I recently was fortunate to find you. I watch every video you put out and have been catching up on all your past videos. There's just something real and authentic about you Risa that I connect with. You honestly care about your fans and it shines through. So though I am only one small voice I thank and applaud you for this video. For telling the truth about \textbf{ageism} in the beauty industry. And I hope you and others make your voices heard for yourself and your fans. Let these big companies know that we are consumers too. That we enjoy getting new makeup and skin and body care items too. That it's not all about the young ppl. I'm a Baby Boomer and we still make an impact with our buying habits. Just bc we're older we are still consumers who are sick of being relegated to the corner. That there is room enough for all of us in the scheme of things. Thank you Risa. Don't despair and don't give in to any of it. Your public including I love you and thank you for all the time and effort you make to bring your wonderful videos to us. We stand with you and other over 40 artists. Stay strong!

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Hi Risa 100. . Agree with you it is typical of the makeup companies targeting the younger generation and us older \textbf{woman} get left behind.I will wear makeup until I die whatever \textbf{age} I'll be.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I agree with your analysis. Sure they may market to us but do they cater to us!!? One reason 20, 30 somethings can have larger followers is because us 40, 50 60 year olds follow them, but will a 20, 30 something follow a 40,50,60 year \textbf{old}, that's the question.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}1/50 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.0 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small You are absolutely correct. I do have a few younger viewers and followers(mostly on Instagram) but no, most don't want to follow anyone over 40 because to them we are ancient! Not to mention so many of them are scared to death of the aging process, so if you don't have flawless, wrinkle free skin with full lips and brows, high cheekbones and no smile lines, they aren't interested. I mean, look at how many young influencers are getting botox and fillers???? It's \textbf{crazy} to me. They really should spend more time looking at older women and perhaps they'd realize that growing older isn't such a scary prospect!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Crazy & \cellcolor{green!27}Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}1/108 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.926 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I think the industry is missing the mark to not include a range of ages.  I honestly look better now than I did in my early 20's and I am more confident.  Plus, NOW I can spend whatever the heck I want to on make up, clothes and skincare.  I feel about 32 not my real \textbf{age}.  And my 70 year \textbf{old} mom is still gorgeous and youthful looking and cares about and enjoys all things beauty.  I am a mom and a step mom and in my late 40's.  But, I never stopped being ME.  I think if these brands showed older women the entire world might realize older women are not dead or unattractive.  No one thinks I am the \textbf{age} I am.  But I don't think it's because I am unusual...I think the perspective of over 40 is what is off from reality.  xoxo\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}3/147 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.041 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I'm so happy you are talking about this.  Like you; I'm 45, and in the pursuit of being 40+ and feeling and looking pretty. In that search, and in hopes of not becoming obsolete in my two daughters eyes, (ages 19 \& 14) I watch YouTube and follow influencers around my \textbf{age} group and even younger to feel current and fit in.  To my surprise, They try constantly to replicate makeup looks from icons such as JLO (48yrs \textbf{old}) and Kim Kardashian (38 yrs \textbf{old}) just to name a few but yet, makeup brands refuse to acknowledge that there is a beauty and uniqueness to us that younger kids try to emulate.  How many of the makeup brand creators they can't stop promoting are their \textbf{age}???? Charlotte Tilbury, Marc Jacobs, Bobbi Brown, Tarte creator Maureen Kelly, Urban Decay (Sandy Lerner 68yrs) etc. are all middle \textbf{age} people yet their target audience are males and females in their 20's.  The whole industry must reconsider and start reaching out more to us! Agree with you 1,000\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}5/174 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.874 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I applaud you for bringing up an issue that is very timely. As far as the comment on folks who may say you don't care about \textbf{racism} in the beauty industry or other issues. I think many of us are guilty of addressing issues that impact us the most. Not that you don't care about \textbf{racism}, but it doesn't impact you on a daily basis. I mean aside from UD seeming to focus on younger you tubers but I wonder if it is was even noticed how many people of color were at the UD event? As a \textbf{woman} of color and a \textbf{woman} who is 40, I am mindful of both because I am reminded of those things daily. I think back to when I first started being interested in makeup and skincare and started purchasing from UD specifically. I never paid attention to the \textbf{age} of the models promoting their products. I mean UD is probably not doing anything different now than they did 20 years ago. I think what makes it different is that we have social media now. When I was a young girl in college UD spoke to me and I have followed and purchased from them since.Now as far as what we can or should do. We should say something and call out brands for not being inclusive. I mean how do brands start being more inclusive based on \textbf{ethnicity}, the customers push them. We are a powerful demographic with a voice and the ability to demand better through our pocketbooks. We can use social media to eand brands do better and we should. Our journeys to this moment demands we should!!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Ethnicity, Racism, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}6/279 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.151 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Well said Tracie. I actually did take notice of who was attending the UD event, and all races were well represented, just not all ages.I agree with you on calling out the brands on both \textbf{ageism} and for not being inclusive. The trouble with attempting to do this within our demographic  is that so many have just accepted being invisible as the norm, and it's not a major concern to them. I saw one comment here that said she didn't really see a problem and there are brands like It Cosmetics and Lanc√¥me that cater to 'older women'. So 2 or 3 brands out of 50 caring about us is acceptable? Not to me! I'm sure you remember growing up when Fashion Fair and Iman were pretty much  the only brands that carried makeup products for women of color. Of course there is still plenty of room for improvement in that area, but progress has been made. Hopefully progress will also come for women over 40 being recognized as a valuable market by the beauty industry. I have been speaking with other over 40 influencers about how those of us that do care can rally together and begin the fight!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Ageism & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/201 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.498 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I grew up with Jean Shrimpton and \textbf{Twiggy} as the supermodels lol.  But boy, I wore my blue Yardley Slicker lipstick proudly!   I do know that when I was in my 20s, there was no way I could have afforded the makeup that the 20 \& 30 somethings are buying.  I also didn't wear foundation.  I could get away with a little blush, a little eyeshadow, a little mascara, and some lip gloss.  My skin was good so I didn't need to cover it up, and it was also a time of going braless and being 'natural' (read hippie).  Nowadays, these young girls are covering their faces with high end makeup.  If I could go back in time, the one thing I'd have changed would be be all the time I spent baking in the sun.  I would have, at the very least, worn sunscreen or hats.  The pretty skin I had back then has certainly paid the price.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Twiggy & \cellcolor{green!5}Physical Identity - Physical Features & \cellcolor{green!5}1/159 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.629 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small This is such an important video! I am 28, and I feel like I'm ALREADY feeling insecure about \textbf{ageism}! I feel like even at 28 I feel \textbf{old} as hell compared to people I see on instagram and youtube. It seems like everyone in beauty ads is in the 18 to 25 range. To be brutally honest, I'm scared of getting older, because even though I'm a confident person, I just hate the way society views "older" women. It's like society expects you, once you're over forty, and certainly over fifty, to no longer be able to wear heels, sexy clothes, have long hair, and wear trendy makeup. I see so many women that look like they're about 70, and in reality they're about 55, wearing frumpy clothes with out of date hairstyles and no makeup, and I wonder, does society make them feel like they HAVE to wear "\textbf{old} lady" clothes and hairstyles and makeup? Is there an unwritten rule that you can't still dress and feel sexy just because you're not in your twenties anymore? I know when I'm 65 I'm still going to love makeup and fashion as much as I do now! It's truly so wrong how this industry makes older women invisible.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Ageism, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}3/207 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.449 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small There is no way we (I am 53) should let the makeup companies get away with leaving us out.  I don't want to be ignored and I don't want to sit back and be invisible!  We do need to be heard and I am on here saying so!  I started watching the younger makeup youtubers but I really wanted to see more ladies my \textbf{age} and with my skin tone (that is another issue, because there are not any older Hispanic women who are youtubers) but I only found a few over 50 and none of them have my skin tone.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small This is a great video. But i think something to consider is the way the youtube influencer has evolved.It's kind of something that just exploded during a time of change for your generation, and what is the norm for the younger generation. you touched on it when you mentioned that not many people are on Instagram in your \textbf{age} range - because it wasn't a part of social life.  Heck i'm only 31 and I feel a disconnect with early twenties kids and i know it's because this is what they grew up in so naturally there'll be bigger audiences and representation. i guarantee you the demographic skew will shift as these same ladies grow older, because the whole platform of youtube as media has only just begun, relatively speaking. Eventually it'll be just like tv and movies, where you have an even distribution of older, current and up and coming artists.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I am 49 and yes I would like to see our demographic represented more than it is with companies. One question, you said at the beginning "being eligible", I don't understand what you meant. From my point of view women are eligible at any \textbf{age}. Melissa55 wrote to Estee Lauder about that when the add for the new A.N.R. serum with one of the Jenner came out. How ridiculous is it to take a 20 some yrs \textbf{old} for a serum to improve wrinkles... a bit of a rant here, sorry...

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small In a statement from Paula Begoun's "Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me" she cites that the beauty industry is 98 marketing and 2 other. These brands want their products to be viewed by as many eyes as possible. So they're embracing a generation that lives, eats and breathes social media. Do they have the same buying power as their Gen X and Baby Boomer counterparts? No. But they're more inclined to respond to "influencing", follow trends and make impulse purchases. I think the beauty industry markets to the over forty demo through traditional marketing like television ads, print ads, QVC/HSN, infomercials, and direct retail sales. One would think that given the \textbf{age} of UD's founder and Jennifer "BIG 5 0" Lopez, there would've been more inclusion of older influencers.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/131 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.763 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I hear you and I so agree! It's EASY being young and beautiful! As we \textbf{age} and our skin, body and lives begin to change. It's much more work to look good and feel good and takes much more effort! I do feel like older women are not included from so many things in society. I'm 57. My children are grown, I'm now retired, my body and my face are not as they once were when I was younger. There is a certain isolation that comes with \textbf{age}. While I can still identify with being YOUNG and beautiful (because I once was) the younger twenty-somethings cannot identify with me. But here is what I believe is important...as women of \textbf{age} we have SO MUCH MORE TO OFFER! We've seen it all, done most of it and as you stated, we are confident with ourselves. The young YouTubers can give makeup advice and tutorials but women of \textbf{age} can give advice on life experiences as well. How to remain healthy at our \textbf{age}, how to fight the aging process of our skin, how to be inspirational to others who are at this same point in their lives. It's become a world of social media and technology. The 20-somethings know no different. Most women of \textbf{age} are not knowledgeable and need to become more educated to the world of IG, YouTube, Snapchat and Twitter! Like many ladies who have commented, I can honestly say that I spend more time and money on looking good and taking care of myself now than I did when I was younger! Do some women our \textbf{age} just quit trying? Is makeup and skincare, looking good and feeling good LESS important to them as they \textbf{age}? Perhaps when you FEEL invisible in society you allow yourself to become invisible! The change has to begin somewhere and I believe it has begun with YOU and other YouTubers that I follow who are women with so much more to offer than a pretty face. Beauty comes from within and I find women of \textbf{age} to be so much more interesting and knowledge. I guess the question is... how do we get women of \textbf{age} more involved in social media, beauty, self help?!? Keep doing what you do and others like you! Spread your beauty, \textbf{age}, knowledge, wisdom and opinions! Let the world know that true beauty comes with \textbf{age}. You do a FANTASTIC job and I love your 'talk' videos because it shows this YouTube community that you have true substance and so much to offer!

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I dont think its necessarily s showing our \textbf{age} group doesnt spend money on makeup but that we dont use social media as much. There are not as many 40 year olds twitting, on Instagram or even on Youtube. They probably figure their marketing dollars for 40 up is better spent on print and tv ads and on social media for the younger demographic. I do believe more effort should be made for social media marketing for women 40+. Maybe not as many events and instead of a night club setting a nice dinner and cocktail hour or a weekend to a spa where the ladies can learn about the product, post on social media and have an event more suited to the 40+ demographic.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Great discussion - I can say from my 55- yr-old perspective that I purposefully look for ‚Äòolder' (meaning 35 or 40 \& over) makeup artists on social media who look beautiful and have a beautiful spirit - like you! I spend a lot (too much many say! üòÇ there's always a makeup box of some kind being delivered to my house!) I only want to buy what I've seen look good on and recommended by someone closer to my demographic (heck, for that matter, I try to find older, dark eyed, brunettes like me to follow for makeup recommendations because I've found I'm even happier with those purchases). ANY makeup looks great on a 20-something (we've all been there, but you're right - life goes by fast!) I may watch a younger person once in awhile but it's getting rarer - they don't address what I'm interested in and I don't ‚Äòtrust' their recommendations or look to work for someone like me although I think it's great they appeal to their own \textbf{age} group. However, I think women my \textbf{age} and place have a lot more disposable income to spend on makeup and if, like me, you're kind of obsessed with makeup and skincare, there's a lot of money to be made! But - the catch is - we're much smarter from experience - we're not typically going to spend recklessly on every single new trend- it has to work and it has to come recommended from someone somewhere close to my \textbf{age}. And from someone with experience, who REALLY knows what they're talking about, who I can trust. I would be so impressed with a brand who would embrace and support a movement and artists like you and others you mentioned here who I follow. IT Cosmetics come the closest to that, that I can think of right now. Thank goodness for women like you in this space - I guess I wouldn't even be here if I hadn't found you and others I trust and admire!!! Thank you for all you do!!!

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I'm 48 and have never purchased more makeup and skincare than I have the last few years. You give me hope that you can feel beautiful after 40 and life isn't 'over'. My question is - who is going to replace all the influencers the second they hit 30+? Taking selfies and posting every 5 minutes sounds boring and shallow. Even if I were that \textbf{age} I'd rather LIVE life than sit around taking selfies. It's sad that companies are promoting this shallow behavior, in my opinion. Again, these influencers will be replaced as soon as the next best thing comes along and they aren't the newest thing anymore. I wonder how they will deal with being yesterday's news. I think companies should wake up and realize 'older' women can sometimes afford to spend more money, and they shouldn't exclude us.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/141 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.709 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Honestly I spend wayyyyyyyy more money on make up and skincare in my 40s than in my 20s. I make more money as well. I think make up companies are missing out on not including the older \textbf{age} group. But you are right, the twenty somethings are always on social media so they are the main targets for advertising.  I guess they think everyone wants to be young and party and have a \textbf{crazy} night life so that's what they target. Its also true that YouTubers  and influencers who are in their 40s or more are not  as rampant as the twenty somethings. But I do believe as a subscriber we fight \textbf{ageism} everyday by actively following, commenting, purchasing, following links  etc.  That electronic footprint.

My 2 cents would be that I'd like to see us ‚Äòfight it', but more from the perspective of wanting the brands to include us in the things we care about, rather than including us in the things we don't care about, like you said in these events and trips we might not be interested in anyway.  I don't know if it's my \textbf{age} (42) or not, but I find the amount of \$ sunk into parties designed around selfies and trips to the Caribbean more off-putting than envy-inducing.  When a brand I like sponsors/markets that sort of thing, I find myself put off of them.  Personally, I'd rather see them spending their \$ on alternatives to animal testing or using ‚Äòclean' ingredients or investigating ways of sanitizing returned makeup to be able to donate it to womens' shelters, rather than on these trips that don't have anything to do with the actual makeup.  I'd also like to have them ‚Äòcommunicate' with us in a way that's more mature.  It's not just the trips etc, though, but also the way the products themselves are marketed.  Like these ridiculous limited edition launches.  Women our \textbf{age} have jobs and lives and don't have time to sit around all day ‚Äòin class' refreshing our webpages to jump on purchases before they're sold out.  To then have the brand respond to our inquiries with ‚ÄòAw, sorry, hon, but you'll have another chance to buy soon!'  Is this how adults communicate with each other now?  Makes me want to skip the purchase altogether... ok, rant over.  Thanks again!

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Risa I totally understand and the only cosmetic company that I do think is trying to reach out with products for our \textbf{age} group is Covergirl.  Ya know it's funny...when I was a tween I remember CG was the foundation, powder, blush, eyeshadow and eyeliners/mascaras, etc...this is the makeup I remember being really big.  This is the makeup alot of women started out with...my first foundation was CG and I loved everything from them.  Ya know times and styles even trends has changed but CG is still kickin.  They "IMO" evolve with women of today young and \textbf{old} but \textbf{ageism} is still there.  "IDK", I may not be gettin this out right at all, but I honestly don't see any of the other cosmetic companys using an older \textbf{woman} in a TV Commercial.  I do however think that brands don't focus their Items for the more mature women, when in reality we're the one's buying most of the pricey skincare (for sure) and makeup.  Anyway I just thought and started typing, lol!!  Women of our \textbf{age} are not who the makeup companies are trying to target, but were no doubt the women taht are buying their products!  Girl I could probably talk all day but I think I've made a small point adn some women will probably be able to relate to where I'm comin from.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Yes, all \textbf{age} groups need to be involved.  If a company is only designing a product for teens to 25 that's different ,  People of all ages see products in different ways and find a variety of uses, many I think the company never considered.  Companies should also consider how large the 40 and up demographic has become.  I'm in my 50's, started watching Elle Leary and that led to maybe 6 definite individuals I really follow.  I pick who I follow based in their intellect, if they have similar desired outcomes, and the  reliability factor.  Yes, I watch a few who I share \textbf{nothing} in \textbf{common} with because it causes me to think like you are now.  I don't have the time to be involved in 10's of social media platforms and I do enjoy some privacy in my life. I'm very selective.  I think there is so much to be gained by putting down the devices and being present.  I also have concerns about these younger people creating a false reality.  So I would say your thoughts are very good and valid.  For this who feel differently and want something different that's great.  I think there's room for everyone. A really great conversation.üëç\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Common, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Youngsters, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}3/205 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.463 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Risa, makeup companies are \textbf{crazy} to not include all \textbf{age} groups. Just because we get older doesn't mean that we aren't interested in new product launches.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Great video. I have learned a lot about how to apply eyeshadow from you. I think there is a perception out there that women of a certain \textbf{age} or 'moms' don't really care or bother with makeup or clothes or anymore. While some may not want to put in the effort anymore, I think a lot of women do but have lost their way. If they only see 20 something models for  hair, makeup and clothes, they cannot relate and give up. I personally was in a funk for awhile but pulled myself out and started taking pride in my appearance. Watching women on YouTube that are around the same \textbf{age} as me really helped me get confident with makeup and finding clothes that I love.

Being a career \textbf{woman} with a solid financial status, I can afford to buy what I want, within reason.  That is the first reason we should fight back.

I was a hair dresser for 30 years, I thank God that I had a confident view of our beauty inside and out, and still today at 62, I still have the confidents to continue to be the best I can be for my \textbf{age}. It would be awesome for us older ladies  to be more inclusive with no \textbf{age} barrier... I forgot the name of the book or Netflix special.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Something is to say for this discussion.  I feel that YouTubers in the upper \textbf{age} brackets, feature Luxury make up such as Tom Ford and Pat McGrath.  It is my understanding now I've been watching YouTube since TiffanyD was filming in her closet, that Luxury Brands are only purchased by those who have the disposal income to spend \$50 on a lipstick. I have begun to post and tag brands such as Natasha DeNona, and Tom Ford on my Instagram BeautyisScience, to bring awareness to the fact that the 40 year \textbf{old} African-American \textbf{woman} is an avid consumer of their product.  I also want to note that brands such as Tom Ford don't send out PR, or do Brand trips.  I was horrified when I watched Laura Lee, review Tom Ford and bash it due to her lack of knowledge on product knowledge.  Once again an \textbf{age}, and socio economic demographic taken into place.Excellent discussion Risa, I say we rise up and let these folks know that 40 is the the new 20, We maybe 40 but have the income and resources to live as though were 20.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I'm so glad you started the conversation about this. I spend good,money on makeup,but I've given up buying certain,brands who only use 20 somethings in their presentations. I totally agree that companies should be aware of the "\textbf{ageism}" in the industry. Young,women don't have the disposable income to continue to buy products,relentlessly. If companies choose to take that route,they will be digging a rather large,hole for themselves. It seems they value quantity over quality,and that business model has an expiration date written all over it.We are the demographic who keeps these companies going. If they don't understand that,well, their glitter in every thing makeup won't last long. I don't use CoverGirl,but they have Maye Musk in their commercials,.She's in her 70's. Anyway, you are smart,gorgeous,and have so much to offer the world of professional makeup. If companies  don't see that,it's their loss.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Right on sister! I'm 47 and finding channels where make up and brands are \textbf{age} appropriate and beneficial are far and few between..you're awesome. But to get reviews of the newer makeup launches..we on you tube have no choice but to subscribe to the babiesüòÅ..and then their numbers go up and they get all the PR. Not fair b/c ste the companies asking follow up questions..etc?! I may watch videos from the younger ladies but I would never ever do my make up like they do..most look like drag queens (and not in a good way..). Why why why?

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I watch women on You Tube whose opinion is based on knowledge and experience. There are not many young You Tubers who have the knowledge and experience that I'm after. I watch the women in the US and the UK whose knowledge-based recommendations I'm willing to take.  That means I buy the products they recommend. I have to think these companies see that.  I watch your videos for that reason and I often buy the products you've recommended. I've not bought any products from Urban Decay because I felt their marketing was aimed at a demographic I may never have been part of at any \textbf{age}.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/106 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.943 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Unfortunately the cosmetic companies have the fashion industry as an example.  Despite the fact that older women have way more money to spend, the models are teenagers with teenage bodies.  There is some handwringing in the fashion press but the companies pay no mind.  But to answer your question, we can and must push back because we need to know about the products and while I enjoy watching some young YouTubers, their experience with many products just isn't going to translate for me. I need a review from you or Elle L. or Angie or Tammy before I will buy most products.  I started wearing makeup at \textbf{age} 13 and I am now retirement \textbf{age} so I am not going to stop any time soon.  In fact, now that I don't have to look office appropriate, I wear more makeup than ever.

I saw your beautiful face and thought I wanted to watch you because you were gorgeous and your makeup was divine. To me you are every bit as beautiful as the young uns. But I definitely understand where you are coming from. I went to a Nordstrom event once and they seemed to have absolutely no interest in the thoughts of anyone over 25 because they wanted to reel in the younger customers because they had a lifetime of buying ahead of them.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/106 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.943 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I think it starts with the young image and getting away from the strong pressure projected by the industry that only the young are beautiful, and as you said they will be our \textbf{age} before they know it so, I think there will be a push back as the younger influencers start to \textbf{age} out. I truly think it starts with us also taking care of ourselves, and wanting to look good over 35 over 40 over 50 - it is not about looking young it is about looking good and changing that image and for the business/industry to be inclusive (many ore not inclusive in their brands for women of color to so it is not just those of us that are older). I was completely upset and have been with It cosmetics that was a brand specifically targeted to women not young girls that did a contest and showed only girls not women, on top of it they barely had any colors foundations for women of color. There is the fact that most people on IG and you tube are young so, the marketing PR is  sent to them to show. I think more of us need to speak out and call out the companies. However, Lancome has Isabella back and also one of the drugstore brands was it covergirl has their commercial with a very mature \textbf{woman}. I think it would help if some of the nineties super models that used to represent these brands would speak out. We do have a lot of buying power but the marketing is geared to the younger ones that are using you tube and IG more. I think the message as well from us needs to be it does not have to fall apart after kids and a lot more responsibilities the more of us that stay looking good, keeping the glam on the standards are raised and have our channels recognized here it will create some change over time and change that image that only the very young are beautiful.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/341 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.88 \\  \hline

Sadly, so much of our youth is spent focusing on our looks ( I remember this being the case with me) and I look back and I am so embarrassed by that. The event that you attended with Urban Decay, sitting there noticing the younger girls taking selfies is a sad realization of where their focus is also.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Jennifer Lopez is 48; Beyonc√© is 36;  Rihanna is 30. Clearly these social icons and beauty/lifestyle icons don't fit the demographics of the twenty somethings that appear to be the focus of cosmetic companies. Additionally, older women tend to have the availability of income to spend lots of money on cosmetics that the twenty somethings don't generally have and in fact, to a large degree, maybe paying for the cosmetics for their twenty something daughters. I started paying for cosmetics for my daughter when she was in junior high and it wasn't drug store so, what is it? Could it be social media? Could it be that Instagram is a larger platform for the beauty industry because its 'instant' and as you said, older women aren't 'signed up'?I think some homework needs to be done before we get offended or just blindly accept that we are too \textbf{old}. After all, UD did send you PR and included you in this event. Let's be the smart and wiser beauty community and do a bit of digging to find out the stats before we simply posture and accept. My daughter has a BS in digital media and communications which is basically a social media degree so I am going to query her about this. I encourage other people to do the same.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I totally understand where you are coming from am 46. Another issue I think is the young need to be lead and "influenced".  We don't as easily respond to "if you want to look cool you should buy" mantra. True I would prefer someone my \textbf{age} to let me know how a product will respond, that's IF am in the market for that item. Young people tend to buy anything that sparkles or is a trend even if they already have 10 of the same thing.  Where as we tend to be quality or quantity. If a mature \textbf{woman} finds the foundation that works for her (this includes me üòä) she is most likely going to stick with it or be brand loyal (you'll have to pry it from my cold dead hands üòÇ). Tutorials are I think are a more even playing field we all tend to want to know the best way to apply or get the most out of a product.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Dear Risa. I do not like the term 'anti-\textbf{age}'. I don't want to be younger, I love my \textbf{age} (41) My mother died when I was a baby, and every birthday I have is fantastic. I'am grateful.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I think it all has to do with marketing. I'm on my way to 65 and still wear a full face at least 3 times a week; the vast majority of my friends wear almost \textbf{nothing} and don't think they can wear makeup any more or don't know how because the interest in wearing it wasn't such a big thing when we were younger (compared to today).  My \textbf{age} group does purchase less. But I do think marketing misses the point. If you also show the mature user, it's saying 'our stuff is so good look how great even mature faces look'.  Bobbi Brown often shows mature faces and her brand obviously touts beauty across the board.  I don't think my \textbf{age} group can influence via purchasing power but we certainly can write in. Either way, I'm happy playing with makeup until I die whether I see mature faces advertised or not.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}3/152 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.974 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I also think it's kind of ironic that women over 40 wear less makeup and feel that they don't have to care anymore, because after 40 is when we women often need and should wear more makeup and make an effort. When you're in your twenties you can get away with anything, but when we reach a certain \textbf{age} it takes more to look good, and that's where the ¬´Magic of makeup¬ª comes in and can make us look young, fresh and great again!!! I respect the choices of women in their forties and fifties and up who don't feel like doing their makeup (allthough I think for alot of them it's more about not  knowing anything about makeup-which is also a sign we need more older influencers) but since I myself looove doing my makeup I feel the right to object to this \textbf{ageism}!;);)\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Ageism & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/145 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.379 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I'm 60 and a beauty YouTuber since early 2013. PR for my \textbf{age} group is usually limited to wrinkle creams and foot peels from dermatologists and Chinese companies who only sell on Amazon. In comparison, the younger ytbers get full sets of season collections and eye shadow palettes from a multitude of big cosmetic companies. Like your situation, I went to IMATS last year and I was one of about 5 people attending over the \textbf{age} of 40 and all of the makeup and products were geared towards 20 somethings. There is definitely a prejudice towards older people on YT, especially in the beauty community. You are so right about the \textbf{ageist} attitude in the beauty industry.

Maybe the message these companies are sending by using young women is ‚Äî You can look just as good as these young \textbf{woman} by purchasing our products.

I'm not 20 anymore and I spend a lot more on products now that I'm in my 30s. When I see brands promoting anti \textbf{ageing} products using teenage looking models or influencers, I completely disregard and don't take them seriously.

I don't want to follow everyone on every platform out there, nor do I want to be checking my phone all the time just to see selfies. Life is meant to be participated in, not watching everyone else do their version of life online. You ought to devote the amount of time to YouTubing that makes sense to you and not let the ever increasing demands of someone else's idea of success define what is success to you.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Do you remember years ago when Isabella Rossalini was fired as the "face" of Lanc√¥me and told it was because she was too \textbf{old}?  She was rehired not that long ago to represent Lanc√¥me again. I guess we could look at that and say we have made headway and be satisfied. Did Lanc√¥me rehire her because they have suddenly become interested in the inclusion of older women or is it because there has been a movement of older celebrities campaigning against \textbf{ageism}. In the end, I think most companies are forced to look at the bottom line and we must not be that large a demographic. It would be interesting to know what percentage of profits we represent.  Typically, most people in their twenties cannot afford high-end brand makeup on a regular basis.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Ageism, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}2/133 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.504 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small YES, YES AND YES! PUSH BACK.Here's the deal...u are right about the companies u mentioned doing their demographics, etc.  My opinion is tht Urb Decay, 2Faced, etc. were marketed to the younger to begin with.  Who knew women would still look so young after 30 and be into all the same as the young gals are, after all, they too, were 25 one time :)So, yes, push back as Melissa55 did to Estee Lauder about their ads using a young gal to promote anti-aging prods. She's over 60 in case u don't kno her and no cosmetic procedures.These events would be better served divided into 2 or even 3 groups if the companies could afford. They shd do up to 35 then 36 to 45 then 46 to 66+.We may be older but we like it ALL too, just as we did decades ago.Decades ago, makeup was not diverse. ..u had drugstore stuff for young and high end for mature or wealthy. Ha.U hit nail on head by saying the young purchase more....I think they do from 20 to 30 because it's all about them at tht \textbf{age} so they indulge. As we get older, have kids, bills,etc, we have less to spend on ourselves  (most of us).So push on girl and btw, u look 25ish on YouTube so perhaps they felt u fit right in:)I can talk to anyone about anything but I'm drawn to intellgence and older people tht have more to say.I would not enjoy hobnobbing with the 25ish. Sounds like the co event wanted lots of PR exposure amongst just that \textbf{age} group.Sadly,  the older women really are the ones with more to spend but its spent wisely.

You fill a niche on youTubing makeup for 40+ crowd.   I want to learn how to stay current with all kinds of makeup looks.  The significantly younger influencers don't know , don't have the experience simply due to their \textbf{age}.  There are also a gazillion ways of how product performs on more mature skin vs skin of someone in their 20's.  It's a fact of life.  I would love to talk further with you on how to create more relevant content for those of us over 50 and how can the brands help support the mature market and make it a win/win situation all the way around.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I am 37, I have two teenage kids, and I have been obsessed with makeup since I was a young teen. Makeup and now that I'm older, skincare, are a huge part of my life. I COMPLETELY AGREE with you! I scroll through YouTube and Instagram and see these 20 somethings with massive followings giving their opinions on products that some quite frankly are not even for their \textbf{age} (skincare). I just wanted to throw out a tiny observation and I could be completely wrong....but I think their following (high numbers) has a lot to do with more younger folks constantly being on YouTube and Instagram. Now, myself and of course all of us are on here but I'm just making a generalization that I think there are a lot more younger girls perusing these platforms than older women. I'm not saying that older women don't. I just don't think millions and millions of older women do. I wish they did though! üòï Then I think the numbers would shift. But I completely agree with all your points and especially BRANDS choosing younger girls for advertising and promotions!! I don't think it's fair at all!!!

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Interesting thing is that when one goes out into streets there are mostly older people. And when you're yong, you feel uncomfortable in real life situations as majority is older than you. But in media it seems vice versa. I'm 40, bt in real life situations I still feel that most people are older than me. While on youtube and other media I feel like I'm wrinkled, 80-year \textbf{old} grandma in a corner behind all those young beauties. So I totally agree with you. Even if companies have done their numbers, they just neglect perfect opportunity to involve much larger audience as customers. It is harder to impress us with new shiny things, as we grew up to gaining some knowledge and reasonning, and companies obviously have to put some more effort into promoting and finding entrance points for \textbf{elder} audiences, they seem just don't want to hassle with that.

I have also recently transitioned to my grey hair so I feel my makeup and clothing colors I should wear have totally changed.

That's a big reason why I loved youtube because that's where I found tutorials on how to do makeup on Asian eyes. I actually found you through your hooded eye tutorial!Luckily I think inclusion is "in" right now. It's sad that it has to be backed by money to make these big beauty companies get on board but not surprising. I'm beginning to see more representation of races in campaigns and huge backlash on companies who don't release a large foundation shade range for example. Hopefully, this inclusion trend goes on to include mature women because women don't stop existing past 40. I think you should keep fighting it and hopefully you inspire other past 40 women to voice their opinions on Social Media because brands definitely have their ears open and if something makes enough noise, they just may consider changing.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Ageism & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/203 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.493 \\  \hline

I came across your tutorials and I immediately subscribed to your channel. I believe it is important to represent our \textbf{age} group and fight against \textbf{ageism}.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I just turned 49 last week and yes I feel very underrepresented in the beauty world. I have adult children 2 of which are daughters and the funny thing is they get their 'high end' products from me. If I buy something I don't end up liking I give those things to my girls. Now I know that these young women with huge amounts of followers more than likely do not get their products from their moms, the brands send the products to them but part of my money that I use to support these brands are going to these kids that are on social media and that stings. I don't identify with twenty somethings heck I get irritated with Instagram and forget Snapchat that thing is ridiculous. I am on Facebook or YouTube and I have to dig to find those on YouTube that I identify with, I am lucky I found you and MrsMelissaM and Stephanie Marie and Lisa J. I am subscribed to younger women but there are only a few that I even like. How do we push back, how do we get the message out there? Will the brands even care if we push back because they have these kids wearing their products and going on brand trips?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Absolutely agree with you!  You have been an inspiration! What really drives me nuts is when a skin care company campaigns women in their 20's for anti-aging products. I mean, really?  As a \textbf{woman} in my 40's, how can I relate to that?  Unfortunately, agism exists in all professions, not just the beauty industry.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Hi Risa! You are the first you tuber I subscribed to when I suddenly realized I needed to do things differently in my 30s than my 20s. It's not just your makeup that made me subscribe to you but your honest and mature ( mentally) approach to subject matters. Your right, if we voice our concerns, brands will take notice that we are a marketable niche! I want to see women in their 30s going into 40s and then 50s. I want to know how I should \textbf{transition} from one stage to another. And yes, we would definitely spend more money on products because we know that not just anything would work on us. We need reviews and testimonials to guide us through products.

My mouth was agape for so long I don't even remember as soon as you started talking about the urban decay event.

Am I too \textbf{old} for this? (Just turned 50 a week ago) I hope we can fight this with our voices. Maybe we need to get our heads together \& start presenting a way to contact brands.

The CEO did a 180-degree sales plan and revam of every store nationwide. The beautiful bras and matching panties moved to the back of the store. What came up front and center...bralettes.  stupid little \$20 bralettes that you can wear to all the festivals. Come on, who does this?

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I completely agree with you Risa. Those of us in the older '\textbf{age} bracket' need to be represented too. I think from the 'Brands' marketing perspective.... they don't want to be perceived as an 'old lady' makeup brand like Avon, Mary Kay, even Est√©e Lauder. I am 46, and although that sounds ancient to those in their 20's, I feel I am still young and enjoy using a lot of makeup especially from the higher end brands. The advertising and packaging on a lot of makeup products are for young consumers, cutesy and girly. The same goes for certain products and techniques on 'how to' apply products. I'm sick of hearing the 'if you're older you can't or shouldn't apply makeup this or that way, or more mature women shouldn't wear these colors, etc....' It's frustrating to be seen as 'old' when that isn't the case at all. Owners of these companies are our \textbf{age} or older and they 'rock' their own products, such as Wende and Urban Decay. Our society is so worried about stigmas and how things will make us look or how people will think of us. As you get older, you tend to not give a sh* about what others think and just live your life how you want to live it. Cover Girl has the right idea for their advertising... more brands need to take notice!! Sorry...rant is over. I look forward to your next video!

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Thank you Risa for bringing up this topic. I'm 46 and when I first started looking on YouTube for makeup tutorials, all I found were these young girls. Then I tried looking for women over 40 and I only found a few. I'm so happy I found you. The younger girls pile on the makeup and it doesn't look good on mature skin. I agree with you that beauty companies should absolutely showcase older women. We typically spend more on beauty products. I like that one of my favorite brands IT Cosmetics always demonstrates their makeup on an older \textbf{woman} as well as a young \textbf{woman} on QVC. Other companies should do the same.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/114 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.754 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Yes!  I'm 46 and I love makeup.  There are a few younger influencers that I enjoy, but for skincare and makeup I watch influencers my \textbf{age}.

Man, I struggled to find the over 40/50 ladies to  instruct me. I mean I did find a few youngish gals but they all had perfect skin etc. I was so glad to find your channel. You're so right, our \textbf{age} group is so overlooked. I think you should tell the companies how you feel and how a lot of us feel. A lot of us are also of an \textbf{age} where we can afford the more expensive brands so they SHOULD cater to us more.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/110 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.818 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Well, I'm \textbf{Black} and 40 and I think both \textbf{ageism} and \textbf{racism} (and a whole host of other issues) should be discussed, so thank you for tackling \textbf{ageism}! I honestly don't understand why more companies don't hire and promote older women, especially skincare products! Older women on Youtube are lovely, and I'm sorry, but I refuse to watch a 20-year-old review \textbf{age} rewind concealer, so that's just more money (and being older, I probably have more disposable income as well) and exposure that these companies are missing out on.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Ageism, Black, Racism & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}5/89 & \cellcolor{green!27}5.618 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Hi Risa I say let's fight this I'm 49 and I'll be 50 the end of this year and I this it totally sucks that makeup companies cater to the younger crowd. They act like once you hit a certain \textbf{age} that you stop caring what you look like and quit using makeup and that can't be farther from the truth! 'm more intomakeup now than I was when I was younger simply because I didn't think I really needed it then. I use more things now and I also do my makeup better now because I pay more attention to detail (I'm older \& wiser now ;-). I don't know why they think that they need to market to younger people because I know for a fact that when I go out anywhere I see older ladies more into makeup \& looking good than the younger ones, so it really doesn't make sense at all. So YES! Let's fight this! I would LOVE to see our \textbf{age} range represented more! Just let me know what I can do and I'm sure everyone else here would also like to know whar we can do to get this pushed through! \{{{HUGS}}} from KY!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/202 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.99 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Interesting video Risa. I think we buy as much but we think more about our purchases and expect more for the money we put out possibly. Interesting view into the YouTube world, no education conference hosted by UD just hey have a good time young ladies post pictures of yourself then you will push our products for us without us paying you. It's big win for companies.I like UD eyeshadow, but not so sure I like the company now. There is \textbf{ageism} everywhere now but it definitely is and has always been an issue in the beauty industry. For me this particular issue is only worth fighting with my choices in where I spend my money. Other issues are more important.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I don't think it is who buys more. Older women buy more haute couture as well, but the models are all too young to drink legally. I think it is that the industries see the consumers as aspirational--that we are looking at the advertising to show us what we would like to be rather than what we are. Look at the whole segment called "anti-aging".  But I also see a big change in women my \textbf{age}. We want to see people who look like us but a better version. As for "is this issue important?" It is important because it is the tip of the iceberg.  Underlying it is the idea that women are valuable only when they are young. It is a society that dismisses older women and prefers them to just fade away.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/135 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.741 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small What a great video Risa. While I'm 34, I feel the same way. The women that have the most income to spend on high end makeup are over 35, and they are not being sold to or even seen. I also feel like there isn't a place for those of us who aren't full glam people. I'm a very small account, but I know I'll never be reposted because I don't look like an aibrushed 22 year \textbf{old}. I think we need to talk about these topics and I think brands need to listen.

I am obsessed now and just love it.  I spend waaaay too much on makeup, but I am not planning to stop.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I think you said this very well. I am 51, and I care about skin care, make up, health \& wellness. I am shocked that there are only TWO major youtube influencers over 50 years \textbf{old} that I can watch/follow.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Yes, fight it.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small It's funny you post this video now. I looooove Urban Decay. However, this is the first time I've chosen not to buy one of their eyeshadow palettes based solely on the marketing. I'm 53 and while I'm not a mua professionally, I'm always the one to do everyone else's makeup for every event...have been since I was 16. I'm a makeup \textbf{junkie} and get so excited when new eyeshadow palettes are launched. I own over 75 palettes. (I stopped counting at 75.) I always notice that the women are young (and of course, quite slim and I am, let's say, not slim) But this is the first time I've been out off by the marketing that was not aimed just at young women, but specifically college aged, or so it seemed so to me. UD is one of my very fave brands, probably THE fave for eyeshadows. I just can't feel good about giving my money to a company that doesn't want it. If they wanted my money, they'd market to me. I have a feeling this will not be the last time I stage my own boycott. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüëµüèª‚úåÔ∏èü¶ã\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Junkie & \cellcolor{green!27}Behavioural Addiction - Drugs & \cellcolor{green!27}1/189 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.529 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The purpose of my video wasn't to call out or praise specific brands. I am just shedding light on a what I feel is a huge problem that exists in the industry as a whole. Many women can't use brands like Dior and Lanc√¥me because they are full of chemicals and fragrances. A company with two or three  products marketed towards women over 40(It cosmetics) does not make it a brand geared towards mature women. In my opinion at least. If you are happy with the current selection of makeup options available to you, and the way your \textbf{age} group is being represented than  that's great!

If I ever decide to start a beauty channel I'll have to get my 16 year \textbf{old} daughter to run my social media for me, lol. I started following the beauty community on YouTube because of my daughter. Before that I thought YouTube was for karaoke songs and gardening tips. Younger creators have larger followings because younger people are so widely versed in social platforms. My husband knows more about the world of beauty influencers than most of my friends, lol. I really think that companies are missing an entire demographic by not using \textbf{age} appropriate influencers to draw older consumers to the world of YouTube beauty gurus.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I think you have to contact those brands and let hear the voices of the \textbf{woman} who are 35+,they are also beautifull and they might be buying even more make up and skinproducts because they want to count to and even give it more time and expences to look beautifull.When people get older they Will invest more time and products to look good,and every brand has beautyproducts that older \textbf{woman} Will buy,and products that younger people Will buy,because the needs are different,and the beautybrands have to invest time,money and research to go for the needs of every \textbf{age} like a moisterizer for someone in her 20's have other needs as a \textbf{woman} in her 30's,40's etc,that's also with make up.We all love powder,highlighter,concealer etc,but the needs are depending of the \textbf{age}.And I realy think that it is important for every brand to sell and develop products for different ages,so we need to hear those brands our voices and let them see how important beauty is at every \textbf{age},but the needs are different,maybe you can contact Some other beauty influencers from different ages and communicatie with them what the best way Will be to let our voices hear,or brainstorm with them how to contact those brands and explain the needs for different ages because when brands sell products for all ages that Will make those brands even bigger,and they Will earn more money,and I think that most brands want to earn more money becouse of the competetivity.‚ù§Ô∏èI Will give it an other thought Tomorrow,and when I think something new I Will let you know about it\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}6/265 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.264 \\  \hline

Representation is what we need more of. As I know from being an esthetician the ones that come back, that fork out the big bucks aren't the 25 \& under crowd. You want you NEED to please the women 30 \& up the most, Those are the ones that give you an income \& make you who you are.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I wish brands realized that ppl in our demographic have money.  I didn't get serious about my collection until 10 years ago, but now i spend literally houndreds of dollars on makeup each month. Skin care brands somewhat know this to a degree, but why don't they capitalize on us more too?? The fact that the younger generations go into debt for makeup is so different than my generation. And I grew up in the decade of excess (80's). It's odd to me that makeup brands don't wanna cater to my tastes or preferences more. I've been a huge UD consumer for over a decade because they were the edgy brand. I was edgier in my 30's so it was my goto brand. But they don't appear to want to grow older with me.My coworkers in their 60's have it even worse than we do. Lord help you if you're technologically challenged.And who is giving thumbs down to this video BTW. REALLY?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Of course 'dinner and wine and not on their phones constantly' is NOT what they're looking for.  As a company, they want as much advertising as possible.  They want all these 'younger' people posting constant pictures and talking about their makeup so their followers (other young people who want to look and be like them) will buy buy buy!  Not to mention, if they grab a customer young they've got more years to buy their product if they get them to fall in love young.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Hi Risa,  I say let's fight this!  I have noticed this too and it is so wrong.  We see discrimination of all kinds all over the place and there are folks that fight it.  Why isn't anyone taking up this cause?  I am happy for the younger YouTubers that receive the attention, but we also need to see more folks of our \textbf{age} receiving attention for making great strides to help this demographic community!  We are a large group of people who still want to look attractive and the makeup and skin care industry is aware of this, however, they move at a snail's pace.  They use all the current trigger wording such as "anti-aging" and expect all of to run out to buy the product, especially when we want to look like those models in the ad.  The models for these companies should be all ethnicities, size, disabilities, \textbf{gender}, and \textbf{age}.  Why are any of us putting up with this?  The children who grow up to be bullied for not looking a certain way has lasting effects.  We are all different and all deserve a voice.  Listen up those who work for the beauty industry, we are all not in our 20's and those that are, will eventually get older and will want to fit in too.  Don't anger them because they are a mighty force!  Equality is all we want.  It's all anyone ever wants.  Please share this video with everyone that you can think of and I will too.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small After turning 30 when I couldn't make a liquid eyeliner wing as easily on my eyelid, I realized I need to change my perspective.  I originally found and subscribed to your channel because you were different from the other YouTubers who were 21ish while still looking freaking flawless/glam/real.  I think we should make it known to brands that we'd like to see more 30+ \textbf{age} groups represented because we are already starting to see change in the fashion industry - using older models, not retouching ads, all body types and sizes.  I think since beauty, what products you use and how you apply is so connected to the \textbf{age} of your skin they need to step up their game.  Also, my ability to spend \$45+ on a eyeshadow pallet at 20 years \textbf{old} was pretty much not possible, while now I could easily fit a splurge at Sephora into my budget.  And we dont all want nudes! Urban Decay has typically been a "young rebel" company but everyone loves a pop of color or glitter sometime.  I'm sad that you didnt have as good of a time at the event, esp since even some 20 year olds dont like to go out clubbing!

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Omg you are in my brain. We are the same \textbf{age}. I think definitely we want to see a representation, because the people (young) will become the anti-aging quickly. And the researchers need to be devoted to quality ingredients that go into products verses how great there bottle looks like. These companies need to think about this new concept. Generation X and Y and the next decade will be our \textbf{age} with all this technology and they are used to getting the information. The one thing I have to comment on is Angie from Hot n Flashy. She does tons of research on ingredients. She does mention her father is a scientist. If her father can give her knowledge to put on YouTube ( that is amazing-love her), then why can't these MAJOR BRANDS WITH TONS OF MONEY, resources and scientists do it. I am going to assume that it will happen. I just wish it was happening now. Knowledge makes older aging women want the product , only when it works.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Risa,I can't see any of the comments, but I wanted to let you know just how much I appreciated this video! I am a 51 year \textbf{old} \textbf{woman}, which means that growing up, the only ways I learned about makeup and skincare was through magazine pictures and friends...we had no tutorials, etc., to teach us about how to work with color and our various features. I have always had hooded eyes and narrow lips and could never ever make my makeup look good enough to feel confident about it. YouTube has changed all of that for me, and for the first time in my life, I feel confident in my skills! I have a very difficult time finding beauty influencers in my demographic and I think that stinks! Yours is one of the first channels I found a few months ago, and though I rarely comment, you have taught me so much and you definitely inspire me to learn and create new and different looks. I think it's a tremendous shame that the beauty companies don't utilize our demographic- we've got more disposable income, often more time to spend watching YouTube tutorials and reviews, which ultimately can result in our purchasing of their products!  I'd love to start my own channel to reach out to women and men in my \textbf{age} group to show that it's never too late to learn something new, but I have no idea how to start something like that, but would be eager to learn. We are definitely underrepresented in the beauty community, and one of the major things I've noticed is that most of the 'mature' beauty influencers tend to be more real, down-to-earth, and approachable, making them a joy to spend time with. Sorry to ramble, but your video really struck a chord!!

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small It looked like a bunch of kids at that Urban Decay event. Everything is youth oriented. Women in our \textbf{age} group that are career women have the spending power. The only younger influencers I follow is Jeffree Star \& Manny MUA. Sorry some of them have personalities that get on my nerves. I'm in my 40's and I'm right with you! I had my party club days! They were fun but I'm into different things. Yes I want to see over 40 represented! I spend thousands of dollars a year on makeup \& skincare! I buy my 21 year \textbf{old} stepdaughter makeup because she doesn't have the finances to afford everything she wants. Look at Christie Brinkley, Madonna, Susan Lucci, Jane Fonda etc all over 40 and looking fabulous! You are inspirational to me and there is far less drama with the older beauty influencers versus the younger ones. Madonna has her own anti aging skincare line and I'd love someone to review it especially since she's going to be 60 in August.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Please keep fighting it Risa. The older one gets, the wiser one becomes. I'm about 25 years older than you, so imagine the wisdom we have between us. During the last 12months, (because of my husbands cancer treatments), I have spent a lot of my time watching beauty influencers on you tube. What an eye-opener it's been. I used to have my own business in skin care and make up. Way back then, it was the more mature women who spent money on the products and I don't think it's changed. I think some skin care and make brands need to realise this.  They need to understand that the repeat business from the mature women is worth thinking about. One wonders just how much a product costs these days with the cost of travel, accomodation and all the give aways at the new product launches. I'm sorry you felt you didn't fit in at the function. I'll bet the young influencers were admiring you poise and just how stylish you are. Perhaps if we all spread the word about the \textbf{ageism} something will change for the better. Here's hoping.  I'm not on social media Risa, and I don't think many other oldies are either. It's all rather empty headed nonsense to me. Have you written to some companies advising them that it's your \textbf{age} and older who have spare cash to spend on their quality products?  Wise people prefer a well presented and well spoken person on you tube with some substance in their video, rather than watching a quick clip on empty headed nonsense. My other big gripe is that a lot of young beauty you tubers don't seem to understand that it's just not acceptable to use foul language in their demos. I'm not a prude, but I'm absolutely appauled at the lack of respect some beauty influencers have for their subscribers. T shirts, bike shorts and filthy language don't make me want to purchase a product from the company they are representing. They should be removed from the companys'  pr list.I have given up leaving comments for them about the foul language they use. Thank you for your voice of wisdom Risa on this \textbf{ageism} subject.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Part of why older channels don't grow quickly is because we're not being shown all over the place by the brands.   I think we fight back against becoming invisible.   I get that brands want to showcase their makeup on fresh skin BUT there are a lot of us out here.  We are the strongest beauty buying block out of all \textbf{age} ranges.   I would love for brands to consider that at least on an economic standpoint.   Just about every tuber over 40, myself included, have mentioned fighting the \textbf{ageism}.  If we could ban together somehow, a tag video or whatever, it would help our voice to be heard.    I don't know but I think we keep fighting.  Covergirl broke a rule by hiring a 61 year \textbf{old} model, which was exciting....until they only did 1 commercial and a set of Times Square billboards.  Have they shown her or her compatriots on Instagram?   No.  They made news and thenstuck her back in the crypt.   Just because someone hits 35, it doesn't mean they're not still buying, wearing and talking about beauty.   It's frustrating.   These kids who've grown up thinking being an Influencer is a thing...what happens to them when they hit 35 and find it hard to work with makeup companies?   I don't imagine they expect to be washed up at 40....maybe they'll change the industry by keeping their followers as they \textbf{age}.  Idk.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I am in a completely different YouTube niche (fandom), but it's the same dynamic. While fandom itself is filled with (and in some cases run by) middle-aged women, it's rare to see them on YouTube. I even did a video on the reasons why. I found that there's not one single reason; it's a combination of things, but \textbf{ageism} certainly is one of them. I think the single most important thing we can do is to support each other.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Risa, companies have know this, as have women, for a long time. They don't and won't care until it hurts their bottom line.  Also, they are part of a large institutional system that reflects social ideologies, which in this country (and many others) is \textbf{ageist}, misogynistic, and patriarchal. I really think that just your voice is not enough anymore. Their business and/or reputation HAS to take a hit. You speak with your dollars and the cosmetic industry as a whole is laughing all the way to the bank because we are all complicit despite expressions of resistance. I do commend you for bring the issue up again and sharing your experience. Maybe we do buy less even though incomes (generally) increase as we get older (?). Perhaps, we are more discerning and less suggestible. I know I'm not particularly impressionable and certainly don't just buy everything .Maybe they are trying to lock down the young so they have them on the teet longerüëπ.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Gorgeous Risa, I have followed you for several years now and wanted to applaud you for bringing attention to this issue. I'm only 23 years \textbf{old} but can completely understand your viewpoint and believe we all would have a lot to gain if women of all ages were included in the 'professional' influencer industry. I follow a lot of you tubers that are in their 30s, 40s and 50s despite being a lot younger. I do this because I find a lot of you are such WONDERFUL role models. Being able to learn from you (not only beauty or fashion related, but also about life in general - family, finance, confidence and self esteem etc) is truly a blessing. Normally, women in such different ages rarely interact with each other unless they're family, so I find the online community to be a very unique meeting place where there's so much wisdom and experience for us younger women to take part of. Unfortunately, I don't think too many of us really take this opportunity and that might be because of the gap that is still being enforced by the businesses. Either way, I appreciate your videos as usual and found this to be a very interesting topic.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I am not sure what is it that we are suppose to fight against or fight for. I think that our \textbf{age} group is adequately represented and in proportion to actually how many women of our \textbf{age} are actually interested in make up and beauty, as well as to what degree. The fact is that more twenty something year \textbf{old} women are interested in make up than forty,  fifty... And that is not surprising. Twenty year \textbf{old} women have different priorities than thirty,  forty, and older women. And it is easier for a twenty something year \textbf{old} \textbf{woman} to identify with another twenty something year \textbf{old} than thirty and forty year \textbf{old}. I am not saying that  forty or older women cannot teach younger women, they absolutely can, and there are probably a lot of really good lessons that they can and should learn from them, however, I absolutely understand why younger people in general don't listen more to their elders. This has always been the case and in many areas of life, and it will more than likely remain the same. If I believed that there is a great gap between how many older women are interested in make up, watching youtube makeup tutorials, following instagram celebs and how many older women role models are available, then I would think that there would be valid case for action. It is not as if women of all ages are not represented and visible at all. I think the issue is how much they are; and I believe that at this point the representation is pretty much equal to a demand. I do not wish to inflate that demand for the sake of simply  increasing the numbers if the real need does not exist. I know that my view may not be very popular, however, I believe that it is realistic.  I still love you Risa, and I will continue to watch your videos.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Old, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}8/323 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.477 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I wholeheartedly agree! The industry is missing out. I am 45 and just really discovered all YouTube has to offer this year. I have purchased many, many products (shh! Don't tell my husband Lol) since I started watching, so clearly there is room for 40+ influencing. I've learned a ton and have made many changes for the better. I've also discovered many products that I didn't even know existed.   I didn't even know that places like Sephora, Ulta existed. Plus the fact that you can get samples and try before you buy. Even better, you can return it if it doesn't work for you. That is BIG! In my hay day, you bought it at the pharmacy and if you didn't like it you were stuck with it and wasted money. I attribute everything I've purchased to 40+ beauty influencers like yourself helping know what's worth trying. All that being said, at my job I work with an \textbf{elderly} community (average \textbf{age} of 80) and there is something so awesome and freeing about how they just don't care anymore or worry about the things we do. They seem so liberated and I admire it.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Elderly & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}2/194 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.031 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Risa, you have an actual life. A son, a husband, and for a 22-year-\textbf{old}, that richness of life just isn't there. I live in Portland, the land of young retirees and aging hipsters, and while I don't dress like my 26-year-\textbf{old} daughter, wear the same type of jewelry, etc., I am trying to embrace aging. I'm going purposefully gray and that small teal streak I have doesn't look sad like it would on a \textbf{woman} of a certain \textbf{age} where I used to live, in Dallas. My husband encourages me to be colorful in my makeup, and says if it makes me uncomfortable to wear it out, to wear it at home. When we wander around town, which is all the time, I'm always wearing sunglasses anyway, so I'm doing my best to make myself happy, which involves color. As an empty nester, I have the chance to sort of relive my 30s, which I devoted to mommydom and kinda missed the first time. If you go to a function like this again, bring someone and enjoy it YOUR way. You are a beautiful \textbf{woman} and I'm thrilled you explored this topic. Yours may not be the desired demographic, but the spending power is there. I wore UD in the 90s and a couple of years ago they brought back one of my favorite üíÑ shades. Now I'm wearing it again, not to grasp onto an \textbf{age} that passed by, but because I like the color. To wrap up this long-winded answer, I crack up when these children talk about fine lines, but they too will grow \textbf{old} one day. I'm already there, and it's not so scary.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Old, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}5/278 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.799 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I entirely agree with you, especially as I turned 64 a couple of days ago! In my country (France),apart from a very narrow minority, the younger generation can't afford to buy expensive make-up. Only mature women can. Despite my \textbf{old} \textbf{age}, I can't either. I've only ever bought expensive products when they were on sale. Nevertheless the adverts you can see most of the time feature very young women, often so young and beautiful you kind of wonder why they should need concealers and such!  What's the point of showing these girls applying primer and concealer on perfectly smooth and taut eyelids? I guess this way the product will look perfect . Whereas the older generation, not only need more makeup,they may also need to relate to beauty products and to get help on how to use them. I didn't use a lot of make-up in my twenties, but now I have a lot to offset or conceal so I use a lot more,and thanks to your tutorials and other bloggers', I've learnt wonderful techniques. So you're absolutely right! The companies should consider catering to a wider \textbf{age} group.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}3/189 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.587 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I think one of the key contributing factors to \textbf{ageism} in the beauty industry is that as we get older, generally speaking, we are less susceptible to marketing, advertising, and influencers. I think the makeup companies are well aware of this dynamic. I'm pushing 50, and as I get older, I find that I am less likely to be a trend follower who has to have the newest eyeshadow palette or highlighter. I don't own a single highlighter, because my skin would not look good with highlighter (I have acne scarring in those areas that would just be put on blast). But younger me might have had to actually purchase that highlighter or multiple highlighters to realize what a disaster it would be. Now that I'm older, I just know that certain products and techniques are for skin types that I don't have. I think most people have experimented with makeup in their teens and twenties and thirties, and by the time they're in their forties and fifties and sixties, they pretty much know what works and what doesn't. So makeup companies have a higher bar to reach to complete that sale. It's easier to go after the people who are still experimenting, and they're ultimately just trying to move product.I love channels like yours that are geared toward people who are a little more practical, a little less trend-oriented, who are just trying to find products and techniques that are going to make a positive difference in how we look and feel. I don't mind that the younger folks are having a lot of fun with makeup and are the focus of the industry's efforts. They are having their day in the spotlight, just like I did when I was in my 20s and 30s, and I am happy to be out of the spotlight now that I'm older. I don't really want that kind of attention anymore. I will always look after my skin and make an effort to look nice, but I have a much better feeling about my appearance now that I'm older. I don't beat myself up over my imperfections as much as I did when I was younger, I'm much more secure in myself now. And of course that just makes it that much harder for Urban Decay or ABH to sell me stuff.  Love the Talk Tuesdays, I hope you'll continue with this series. :)\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Ageism & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/403 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.248 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I am a 47 year \textbf{old} \textbf{woman} who is newly \textbf{disabled}, who lost my job due to \textbf{age} and disability and was unable to find employment and therefore was sent back to college. I'm considered a nontraditional student because of my \textbf{age}, and a special needs student because of my disability, which is more of a hidden condition. So I look more normal, I'm not in a wheel chair, but i do have an uneven gait. While i noticed the disparity in \textbf{age} on YouTube with the beauty industry, i didn't realize how prevalent it was in all areas of life. Being in class with students who could be my children is eye opening. There is no place where you can see \textbf{ageism} more than in college. And the school knows it's there but there is \textbf{nothing} they can do. At my school, i am maybe one of 15 over 30 year \textbf{old} full time students. And one of 10 who is \textbf{disabled}. I never thought about discrimination with these two groups, until I started living it. Even though the school is \textbf{handicapped} accessible, it's still hard to navigate into bathrooms, or deal with fire alarms and drills for us \textbf{disabled} people. And \textbf{ageism} is something no one thinks about. I'm class, i have to remind professors that I'm not a child, that a home work or class assignment doesnt pertain to me because of my \textbf{age} and life experience. Kids come to me for advice, sometimes, when they are missing their parents words of wisdom, but for the most part, apart from pleasantries and small talk, no one talks to me. It's a lonely experience being in a huge cafeteria full of students all alone. So I understand what you are saying about not fitting in at these events. But being as it's like this for me, it has shown me what it must be like for other minorities, a small taste of being ostracized by society, a bet without the more visible signs of hatred that prejudice can bring out in people. At college, every minority, from \textbf{race}, creed and \textbf{sexual} orientation has a group they can belong to of individuals who are simalar to themselves. But there is no group or club for \textbf{old} people or \textbf{disabled} ones. And while \textbf{disabled} and aging people are a "protected" group, the protection only extends so far in society. I have three strikes against me in the employment world, being a \textbf{disabled} older \textbf{woman}. And it sucks. ( not to mention being over weight which is another added bonus to the equation) Being a \textbf{woman} who likes makeup, I see how the industry is. Even anti aging creams show young women using their products in ad campaigns. Only one company, I think its l'oreal, uses an older \textbf{woman} in ads, but there is a generational gap between the younger ones, and this one line older lady, and that's where we 35 to 50 year olds fit. Any ad campaigns using older women need to address this forgotten group, in makeup, skin care and hair care. And because the ads use younger women for anti aging lines, we buy a product expecting huge results,  and are disappointed when we dont look as young as the model touting the product. And it's hard for us, because of aging, our skin is changing and products that once worked dont anymore. Then you start the scavenger hunt for something that works with out making you older looking. When this started happening to me, I went to YouTube hoping to find tutorials and advice, and I had to sift through all these younger people with perfect skin doing makeup, and the make up looked flawless on them, but hideous on me. It took so long to find people my \textbf{age} to watch, who had problems that I had, who would show me how to cover undereye bags or how to not have makeup settle into wrinkles, or how to cover \textbf{age} spots and discoloration and hyperpigmentation. Problems that occur in aging process its self. So I'm glad that there are people, like you, older, yet still beautiful who recognize the needs of older women and help out.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Ageism, Disabled, Handicapped, Nothing, Old, Race, Sexual, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}25/702 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.561 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Ageism is a fact of public life and American culture.  My take on it is that cosmetics companies are businesses, and businesses focus on making as much money as they possibly can (and you can BET they gather their data about who spends the most money on their products!) and not social justice and equality.  I bet young women spend more money on makeup, possibly to their financial detriment.  I am much older than you are, and I feel a struggle even within myself to accept myself as beautiful in my 60s.  The "fight" against \textbf{ageism} starts with ourselves and our own commitment to supporting YouTube channels by older women and by supporting our own beauty and importance in this society. Your videos are great, Risa, and I appreciate all the thought and time and care you put into providing content that has real relevance to a broader audience than some of the very popular you tubers (that I simply can't watch anymore because they are so fake and irrelevant to anything I'm interested in).\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Ageism & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/175 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.143 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I'm not that \textbf{old} (about to turn 40), but I feel you that I might as well be invisible to the brands like Urban Decay.   I say it's their loss.  20 somethings may have more collagen, but us older dames have more cash.  I'll go spend that cash on brands that acknowledge older women, whether it's luxury brands like Chantecaille or By Terry, or a drugstore brand like Cover Girl (yay for older women in ads).  I do have to admit that as I'm getting older, I'm getting more into luxury.  I can afford it better now, they don't release a million things a year, and their events feature things like actual make up artists, spa sessions and tutorials rather than vodka luges.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}1/123 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.813 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I remember when Urban Decay first came into department stores it was geared toward young people. All the teens wanted prom makeovers from Urban Decay. Over the years, however the company has expanded out to older \textbf{age} groups. So I think that all ages of influencers should be included. Our \textbf{age} group do spend the money and lots of it! (I'm 54) and just like you, I like makeup and getting dressed up so I want influencers to show me looks from these same companies for my \textbf{age}. Hope that makes sense? We all buy Too Faced and Tarte and Urban Decay on so forth. So I'm with you on getting older influencers involved with these companies.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/117 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.564 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Hi Risa, as you said brands want publicity that's why they do the trips and the parties, to have that for "free". Don't think that the issue it's \textbf{age} in all situations, in spite as, as we all know skincare brands do "anti-aging" marketing with 20's years olds. But in makeup think the issue it's more a "free time" issue... how many of the our \textbf{age} range "influencers" have the time to be in constant trips or be in social media all the time if most of them have to have jobs outside social media and have families and some even with small kids to take care of? Brands want to be seen, they don't care if your son/daughter it's sick and you can't go at the last minute, or if your husband has a business trip and you don't have anyone to take care of the kids in your absence. And then there is another issue, since nowadays everyone has to give their oppinion even if not requested and can bash down a person just cause they leave their kids and family to go on trips, brands don't want that kind of publicity. Didn't you saw what happened to KVD when she posted that she had very "vegan" ideas regarding her pregnancy? Not saying I agree with her, but also not boycotting her makeup cause of it. Think brands inviting our \textbf{age} influencers as not just to do with followers but also and specially publicity time. LOL Guess I always have plenty to say too ;-) xxx\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/258 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.163 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I absolutely agree with you that the beauty industry is very \textbf{ageist}. All the pretty colors and products are geared to the younger crowd, and skin care is geared towards the over 30 crowd. It's so silly. Just because we flip from the 24-34 demographic to the 35-44 overnight does not mean that we care less about looking good. Any company that at least tries to cater to all, I will support.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Thank you Risa.  I just wanted to let yourself and Michelle know this is why you really are so relevant and what you do is really valued by our community.  I have a feeling that theses companies may be well aware marketing may be wasted on our \textbf{age} group.  Lord knows when I saw Est√©e Lauder using a famous 20 something year \textbf{old} model advertising advanced night repair I realised they weren't interested in my money anymore.  Maybe as you said they have run the numbers and they realise we won't repurchase a promise because our idol of the moment claims she is using it.  We will just buy products that give results.  I'm not dissing the younger generation because I have been there bought the crap and now I am more discerning. So on this topic I need to say that is why you two are really so influential i have watched both of your videos and paused them to make a list of what to buy.  Which hand on my heart I don't do with younger youtubers.  I think the more these companies try to purchase your favour through these PR trips the more likely I am to move onto another YouTuber because I'm not interested in hearing what the company has to say via a third party which is really what a lot of other channels have become.  This could be the reason they don't spend money trying to advertise to us.  I just can't work out why you don't get a boat load more PR because you both can be held responsible for my very expensive makeup and skincare addiction.  Please keep being who you are we are a community and the fact you aren't getting the perks the other youtubers are getting makes your opinions way more relevant to me and I'm sure many others.  I'm sorry I rarely write comments for this reason, I can't say something briefly üòò .  Mostly please know I agree and am grateful too have you both in my makeup and skincare life.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small This is something I can speak to as well. I was a hairstylist and makeup artist for over 20 years - throughout my 20s, 30s, and early 40s till a hair color allergy ended that career. Even though I look a bit younger than my \textbf{age}, I still started noticing the \textbf{ageism} both with younger clients and with my peers in the industry in my thirties. I started to become 'invisible' to both - even with my high level of skill and expertise. It may be different where you live, but I definitely noticed my regular clients were mostly my \textbf{age} and older. Your confidence and inspirational messages to women in our \textbf{age} bracket is so needed and necessary.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Hi Risa, great video and an excellent topic!  So much to think about!  I think there is flat out \textbf{age} discrimination in the beauty industry, as well as many others, and change is LONG past due.

And all topics should be on the table for discussion if there is a problem that needs to be fixed. It's sad to me that as I have aged more things are wrong with the world than I expected them to be.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small My husband and I will be watching the TV shows, and here comes a commercial for anti-aging products being shown by a model thatis probably 19 years \textbf{old} -- maybe 21!!

Which I have a really hard time understanding since I, at 56, certainty have more expendable finances than a 25 year \textbf{old}!!I turned to YouTube because the makeup and the techniques I'd been using for years was no longer working for my aging skin!! It wasn't easy to find women in my \textbf{age} group! I do follow some younger women, mostly to gain ideas on different eyeshadow colors to combine! But finding the YouTube influencers that could actually assist me in finding makeup that won't sink into, and accentuate my wrinkles, pores, and less smooth facial skin, and skincare than can actually and truthfully repair my skin problems has been challenging! I feel that we should take a stand! We need to stand up and be counted! We have the finances and are ready to spend the funds to help us obtain our external beauty!Unfortunately, I was never able to have children, but most people my \textbf{age} have sent all their children thru high school, as-well-as college. Those kids are out on their own, and are no longer an expense in our budget! It is now time for us!!

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I wish brands would reach out to the mature community more. See that's why I'm not sure about going to events.

I'm not into nightclubs and I never have been so that's not an \textbf{age} thing for me. I'm just not a party girl. I enjoy my cocktails but not when I have to scream to someone standing in front of me because the music is so freaking loud. Here's the thing I think these companies are missing. Us mature ladies spend a lot of money on ourselves. We spend \$\$\$\$ on skincare, makeup our hair, clothes. Why? Because we want to hold on to our youth for as long as we can. My 18 Yr \textbf{old} daughter could care less about makeup. And when she does wear it she buys elf because it's cheap. She can wear whatever she wants to. But us mature ladies can't do that. So I spend lots and lots of money on my self. These companies are doing a disservice by not catering more to us mature ladies. It seems like Lancome is trying and I'd like to see more brands do that as well.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Great video!  It's very interesting that brands don't recognize all ages in their marketing.  I'm 44 and love makeup more than ever. I think a big part of it is that I have more financial freedom. In my teens I used my mom's makeup.  In my college days I used drugstore makeup but only had the basics.  In my early 20's my sis worked for Clinique so I upgraded, but again had only the basics.  In my 30's all my \$ went to buying a house and raising a young child......I didn't really buy anything new and what I had was a decade \textbf{old}. Now in my 40's I have a dedicated vanity and drawers of makeup that I adore.  And you're right about the social media stuff. I'm on Instagram but that's it. Often there are giveaways where you need to be on FB or Snapchat and I just don't have the time or desire to be on all of it.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}1/162 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.617 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I wish I knew what to do about the whole issue because I agree with you 100 on all points mentioned. One thing I known can't or shouldn't be done is acceptance. It makes me so sad to see women who are older and more mature that just accept that they are older and just can't be bothered with hair or makeup. In my opinion, \textbf{age} is just a number and everything you make it out to be. You would think that the major brands would care more about the more mature \textbf{age} bracket as I can only imagine that we have more disposable income than those in their early 20s. I know that when I was just out of college on a bank tellers salary, I was lucky to get the newest cover girl foundation. üòÇ But alas, I am at a loss of what can be done to get these brands attention to this issue. And even if they were aware, would they care?

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Although you are too young to be one, the Baby Boomers are basically the last generation of "numbers" that represents the last truly prosperous economy, and being in my late 50's, I am only skirting the "close" of that era.  Yet with ever increasing science and knowledge, and yes, FAST social media communication, I think those in our 40's and beyond are staying younger and healthier, in a more conscientious way, than ever before, and that includes a more youthful appearance!  That said (and without getting too deeply into the "psychology" of the social engineering of our world), I'd personally be prone because of my \textbf{age} and knowledge, to investigate the investors in the brands I'm buying!  Although I've never looked specifically at them, just the name "Urban Decay," does NOT foster an image I'd even consider buying, when considering it's rather "ugly" branding alone denotes a truly negative connotation!  I never found those types of essentially destructive influences anything but part of the subtle  " downfall" of our society overall ... looking deeper into the company, I probably wouldn't be terribly surprised at who and what I might find there beyond the "trend."

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small There is an entire category of women between those who are totally obsessed with makeup and trendy clothing and those who are not at all interested. Many young women focus on looking perfect because they have yet to accomplish goals to be proud of. Those who dont have families and larger financial commitments have more disposable income to spend and cosmetic companies know this. I totally agree that it is irritating, to say the least, when companies use women in their 20's to advertise skincare but you don't have to patronize that company. There are so many products available now that we can choose which companies we wish to buy from. The problem is much bigger than cosmetic companies. Older people used to be cherished and respected for their wisdom by families. We no longer have extended family structure in our society so they \textbf{elderly} become problems to deal with. This attitude filters down and companies pick it up. One of the joys of becoming "wiser" regardless of \textbf{age} is to be able to see from a larger perspective.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Kudos to you Risa for voicing what I think a lot of women feel! Yes we fight... I am 50 and until 5 years ago, I didn't know really what YouTube was ! I thought YouTube was just something my kids watched, mainly gaming videos or kids doing \textbf{crazy} stunts! It wasn't until I was trying to figure out how to set up my sprinkler system and my son said to look it up on YouTube- that YouTube could teach me how to do anything!! Then I found the makeup videosüòÄ! Took me quite a while but I finally found some channels that were geared more to an older \textbf{woman} ( \textbf{nothing} frustrates me more that a 20 or 30 year \textbf{old} doing a video on Mature skin care or Mature makeup applications) I could go on and on but I won't!! I may be 50 in \textbf{age} but I still want to look and feel my best! I would like to see more Mature women catered to in the beautiful industry and not just in the High End stores.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Hello Risa, I have been watching you for awhile now and have never made a comment. I so welcome this topic of discussion. I have seen the beauty industry change over the years in being a makeup artist of 24 years. Working in the industry led me to become also a  beauty blogger and a reviewer of many beauty products. There are not many around me or in my area, that have the same dedication or interest and are near my \textbf{age} group. I feel I am in a category by myself at times in seeking those who share my love of beauty. I see and feel the disconnection of those younger when I have attended some events myself. Seeing younger influencers never make me jealous, it just makes me realize, that us as an demographic of older-aging women tend to get overlooked a lot. I enjoy being 45 years \textbf{old} more than being 25 years \textbf{old} because I am wiser, more experienced being a wife and mother of 20 years. I feel like we as older women do need to be heard and seen more now than ever! We take our time to research products/ingredients including the companies themselves and have more purchasing power that leads to sale influence. We are and can be the back bone of supporting many beauty brands in being loyal to what works for us and in trying new products because we believe in their products \& service as a faithful consumer. I advocate for my \textbf{disabled} son and I see no problem in advocating \& voicing for a community of women, that are just as deserving in being seen \& heard who are just as beautiful and talented in so many ways. In our own way, we can help/mentor younger women and together we could be supportive \& encouraging to one another! I want to encourage you to move forward with this as I will myself in posting about it, even hashtag certain words relating to our \textbf{age} community in getting these beauty brands attention. We are still young, vibrant, and confident, so let's let them know that we not invisible just because we are aging. This is our time too!!! Thanks, for posting this lovely Risa!!! Much love \& hugs to you and all other lovely older \& younger women out there!! üòò‚ù§\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Disabled, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}5/391 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.279 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Dear Risa, It is sooooogood you brought this up. I think we should embrace what we have instead of fighting against 'time'. I often ask (myself) why I should look like 25 being in my early 40? Don't we have the right to celebrate our \textbf{age} and being a bit more mature? It is not always easy of course... Caring for ourselves and feeling good at our \textbf{age} is the key I believe and I cannot thank you enough for being active here on YouTube. Dear Risa, I am grateful for what you do. You help me and your community to feel (and to be) beautiful.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Hi Risa, I think you're more than elegible to be those big brands representative and go to a lot of events and trips, these marketing department's companies are neglecting a huge \textbf{age} group with more possibilities to buy their products, they're not smart enough to create a "line for women in their 40s and beyond", and you'd be a perfect speaker for them because you have the knowledge and the beauty to represent them wonderfully, they are losing the opportunity, it is a pity, but you are our representative on youtube and the rest of social media apps, and let me tell you, you're doing a great job.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I completely agree with you! You and 1 other are the only over 40 I trust with recommendations techniques etc.  I follow some younger ones for oily skin hacks, and others really for shits and giggles because I really cannot relate to them on anything other than technique and  their finished look is absolutely 100 NOT what it will look like on my 49 year \textbf{old} face! Brands are of recent promoting inclusivity in \textbf{race} and \textbf{sex} but what about \textbf{age}? Skin type ? Skin care brands of course target the wrinkles n  fine lines but makeup brands are just about product and results and they always have a perfect flawless 20 something promoting it.  I buy a lot of makeup from high end brands and can achieve many beautiful if not stunning looks it's not like the powder in a shadow is only for 20 something, you know what i mean? So why is it only promoted by a young gal? Also, these Instagram pix are so totally photoshopped and it's so misleading and kinda sad when we look and admire and strive to achieve based on a photoshopped pix? When I photoshop a pix of myself it takes 15 years off my face too ! And then there's the actual videos... the lights and lenses they use are also misleading and I feel so bad for younger girls who think ‚ÄòI want to look just like that or why can't I look like that ‚Äò. I think it causes more problems with self esteem for younger generations who feel like they can't look like that. I like that your opening a platform on this subject, it's def going to go somewhere Risa, people need to speak up more because makeup is NOT just for the younger people, I Love makeup , always have and always will. Instead of commenting gorgeous on these photos I'm going to speak up about ‚Äòcan we see this on wrinkled eyes please ! Lol. And thank you for opening my wrinkled eyes!

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I totally agree Risa, I am 59 and still love to wear a full face of makeup, but with \textbf{age} application becomes harder and that's why your channel is so good even though I am still quite a bit older than probably most of your subscribers. I have to say how sickening It makes me feel when the very young youtubers are showered with new products from makeup brands, taken on the most extravagant holidays etc etc, it's not through jealousy it's just I would like to see more mature youtubers like yourself given a chance to represent us ladies who are still passionate about how we look. I for one have learnt so much from you Risa and I am so grateful but the brands just don't seem to think we exist anymore once we have hit 25 and I do resent that.

I love makeup but, with my newly developing wrinkles and crinkles, I can't wear it the same as young people can. I want to see more from older influencers on how to deal with our advanced aged skin and it gets me that these companies don't tap in to this area of revenue. If they showed more 'mature' influencers they could convince other 'mature' people to give their makeup a try. So many folk of advanced years give up makeup (saying they no longer care) because they don't know how to work with the ever changing topography of their face.I want companies to sell me makeup for my specific needs but it's easier for them to apply to a perfectly smooth canvas over a 3D topography map of the Rocky Mountains..\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}1/146 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.685 \\  \hline

When you are 25, everything is going to look amazing on you.  üòâI wonder if some of it is that many women of our \textbf{age} and older don't wear much makeup.?  I think sometimes, once you have kids, a job, a spouse, a home, etc., you feel like you don't have time to put in the effort.  I'm a hair stylist and I see women everyday who say they don't wear much makeup.  I send them to YouTube to get ideas of ways to wear even minimal makeup, just so they feel better about themselves.   I'm afraid some have just given up and that hurts my heart.  I think every \textbf{woman} of every \textbf{age}, \textbf{race} and color has the right to feel good about themselves.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Thank you so much for this video. It isn't addressed much.  In my generation of teens and 20's, social media didn't exist. We used magazines and watched TV for looks. Alot of us still use the same mediums. The younger generation uses the social media they've grown up with. Also, our generation are in different places in their lives than they are. So, I think alot of the following counts are just due to older people not using social media much. But older \textbf{woman} are definitely buying makeup I assure you.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Thank you for this video! I am a huge fan of your channel (and you!!), and am 32. I think the conversation needs to shift. Our \textbf{age} group has a TON of buying power, and Im inclined to think that these makeup brands think YT and IG are a younger demographic, which isn't necessarily the case. Personally, I feel as if im at this awkward \textbf{age} where the girls in their early 20's are too young for me to relate to, and also a few years shy of the over 40 crowd. Nevertheless, I am looking at my long list of whom im subscribed to, and most are in fact over 40. :) Thank you for these videos, Risa!

It is because we have been dismissed for so long, that many women over 50 give up.  I walk into Sephora and Ulta and I am almost always ignored in my local stores.  Every time I fill out the little survey and say 'NO, NO ONE GREETED ME OR OFFERED ME A SHOPPING BAG WHEN I CAME INTO THE STORE.'  Why don't Sephora and Ulta employ some beauty experts over 40 that are not made up with odd makeup looks?  I think that companies are missing out on expanding their markets.  Why would any savvy company choose to do this, other than also being of an \textbf{ageism} mentality and utilizing 30 something marketing advisors. I am certainly more likely to buy makeup and products after seeing them successfully applied on beautiful women closer to my \textbf{age}.  And you are absolutely correct, you will be over 40, and over 50, and over 60 way sooner than you ever imagined!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Ageism & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/189 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.058 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I will be 62 in October and I follow a variety of \textbf{age} groups.  Unfortunately, I didn't start a thorough skin regime until a year ago and it is people like you that have taught me so much.  Not just caring for my skin but how to apply my makeup and you have covered issues that are in my \textbf{age} group as well.  In a nut shell it is everyone, young, middle aged and \textbf{old} that inspire and teach.  I have gained so much more knowledge and confidence from watching you and others.  We are all in this thing called beauty...outward and inward and from my 60 years of knowledge the younger might hold the freshest beauty, BUT they lack the knowledge of how to be beautiful in all ways.  Thank you for what you do and I would agree on pushing back!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}3/143 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.098 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I wish there were more youtubers and influencers in our \textbf{age} group. And that they were taken more seriously by brands. \textbf{Nothing} wrong with twentysomethings, but I'm not that interested in what they are up to in terms of makeup and products. And btw, I'm buying a lot more now than I did when I was a twentysomething myself.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}2/59 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.39 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Great info. I'm 46 and I'm barely known on YouTube yet but I agree with everything you've said. I also kinda think many of us, well me at least and some of my friends also in my \textbf{age} group don't live on our computers and cell phones and social media the way some of the younger generation does. I was so behind on starting social media a few years back that my Grandpa actually had a Facebook before me!!!! Lol. I used to only use my phone for phone calls and texting and my computer for wotk only. I never even started watching YouTube till maybe 2-3 years ago. Now I know some my \textbf{age} are tech savvy and far more advanced with social media than me. I grew up going to the Library for research, taking photos that I had devoloped and physically put in a photo album, calling friends and family with a rotary phone...or using a pay phone if I was on the go. Times just have changed and our youth are growing up with computers and cell phones and social media. I do still really enjoy watching the young influencers but I can't relate to their skin type, their style, etc so following the mature \textbf{woman} for me at least is my favorite. There aren't just enough mature women and men out there yet that are into YouTube and other forms of social media. But I think things will change eventually and more and more mature women and men will discover social media and also be recognized by more brands in the future. Thanks so much for sharing such a great and interesting topic!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/278 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.079 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I definitely wish makeup companies would include women who are older. My \textbf{age} group is never included-60 plus.  I still care about how I look. I love makeup and will always wear it. I watch you and Mandy Davis for advice. Walking up to any beauty counter at my \textbf{age} is very depressing. If you are "young", people are right there to help you.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/64 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.125 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small It isn't a out being jealous. Your exactly right the older generation is not publicised like the younger generation. This is the one main reason I subscribed to your channel. Yes I follow a few others but only because they are oily skin and I watch to see if foundation stays put. Your the only one that I have subscribed to that actually helps their followers. Your last comment helped me to change my skin care and found one that works and foundation now stays put, including cc cream which for years I have had trouble with. The older generation needs to be promoted more. Our skin changes with time were older but were not dead. A lot of the new makeup is for younger folks not marketed for the older generation. They use the younger generation because they don't have the flaws that the older generation has. Its all about promoting and making the most money. They forget there is an older generation that uses. The fine lines, wrinkles, large pores. As we \textbf{age} it does get worse. Thank you for all you do, for taking your personal time to invest in us your subscribers. Oh and by the way I would have never guessed you were in your 40's. Your skin is so beautiful. Again, thank you.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/219 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.457 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I remember when I first came across your channel; I was so happy to find a beauty influencer more in my \textbf{age} group (I'm 37).  However, I want to point out that I had to do a specific search to find you and others who are, let's say, 35+.  I believe I had to search for "makeup for women over 35", or something to that effect.  The point I'm making is that the beauty influencer community definitely caters more to the younger crowd.  We're not suggested and promoted nearly as much if we're in our upper 30's or older.  No shade to the millennials lol, but in many areas I relate better to people more in my \textbf{age} group.  And I think this is especially importing in the beauty industry because for some of us, we need to change up our skin care and makeup routines as our skin ages and changes.  Additionally, our overall makeup style may change as we get older.  I started wearing makeup when I was 31, but a couple of years ago, I noticed I'm more into the "less is more" style.   I'm so glad you're bringing light to this!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/195 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.026 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small It would be smarter for These big brands to pay more attention to the 40 plus demographic, 'we' are the ones who can show what products can really do for skin that has \textbf{age} on it! Not sure if I'm articulating this well! Especially with the Jennifer Lopez Inglot event, she is a mature women!! She should have mature Influencers promoting her products !\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/64 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.562 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I agree with you.   I turned 50 this year.  I am comfortable with my \textbf{age} and myself.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Risa Does Makeup I'd be HONOURED if you did: alisont1000 I'll go out in all of my colourful looks (apart from the one with blue lipstick!). We do not fade out just because we have wrinkles. Many people say older women are beautiful. They've developed into their own beauty not just 'very pretty'. We do want to see the older \textbf{woman} being used as role models. Like Andy McDowell, Isabella Rossellini, Charlize Theron have been role models. We should be represented in makeup as much as possible. We have more disposable income!!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/92 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.087 \\  \hline
