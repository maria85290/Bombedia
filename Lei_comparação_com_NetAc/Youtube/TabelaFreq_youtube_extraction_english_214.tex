Be it skin color or anything if you want to be in with God you have to change from stupid and immature behavior! I've been in interracial relationships and friendships and went through being harmed and threatened by lunatics who just can't live in peace! One of my best friends right now is a caucasian \textbf{woman} and we e-mail each other occasionally! We were friends for four years now and we share jokes! We also meet up at a waterpark and go on the rides together! I even met her daughter and I help her stay out of trouble with peer pressure! If one of her friends or classmates offer her any cigarettes or drugs and \textbf{alcohol} I told the daughter to say no! I know what it's like because I was a teenager and I dealt with the same thing! The mother told me that one time she was failing her grades and I e-mailed her and discussed some things and before I knew it the mother thanked me for helping her!It's about dialog and understanding! \textbf{Racism} is a terrible thing! If I was a \textbf{black} police officer pulling my friend over and harassing her I would correct that police officer and if a white police officer harassed .s she would correct that police officer too! She knows I don't have any criminal record and I was never in trouble with the law! However she's seen how some of the other white people treat \textbf{black} people and it upsets her being that she's trying to be a better person and she doesn't want her daughter to be that way!

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I am NOT going to respond in any way I've done so in the past. Instead, I present a few questions akin to \textbf{RACE} that ought to be answered TRUTHFULLY .  What led that that toxic thing called \textbf{RACISM}?  How was the cause of its beginning?  What propels some people to think that they have the right to INVADE, MURDER , STEAL and FLEECE another country of its natural resources? Why is not even a mere apology for the most heinous atrocities (inclusive of genocide) against INNOCENT and FRIENDLY people? Who were those behind the SANCTIONING of SLAVERY and the FINANCING thereof?  Where do the \textbf{African} DIAMONDS end? Why is it that TOO MANY of the indigenous people of the \textbf{AFRICAN} Continent  are wallowing in POVERTY? How much of the \$\$\$\$\$\$\$\$\$\$/MONIES made from \textbf{AFRICAN} diamonds are given back to help the DESTITUTES/INDIGENTS of that continent?  What does ISRAEL, BELGIUM, SWITZERLAND and SWEDEN have to do with those DIAMONDS and dire POVERTY of those Africans?  By the same token, why do some countries go to WAR against others to take and control their OIL FIELDS? Unless the EVIL...the unadulterated diabolism of the PAST is objectively approached and a willingness to remedy the SCARS it has left on the mind and soul of those affected or there descendants thereof, the SHOW will just keep going on ‚Ä¶ foolishly! Apologies are wondrous venues of sort to begin. FORGIVENESS of the egregiousness of things done to some by their OPPRESORS and those who have done everything to keep them SUBJUGATED in HUMBLE SERVITUEDE will be a converging beginning.  However, if apologies are the beginning and the end, the sociological scale will NEVER be tipped.  RESTITUTION, RECONCILIATION and COMPENSATION must follow.  When the children of generations to come learn of this racial and sociological frame, THEY, the children of those who forgave and the children of those had been suppressed will be able to heave a rewarding sigh.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African, Race, Racism & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}5/323 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.548 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small 'American society made the Negroes color a stigma.'- Martin Luther King. It's deeply rooted in society. My 8 year olds is 'friends' with a white boy on the camp bus. When he tells his 'friend' bye, the boy looks at his dad first then barely  responds. However, when he says bye when the mom picks him up, he's a little more receptive. It all starts at home. Could be parents aren't comfortable talking about \textbf{race} and seek out segregated neighborhoods so they don't have to be bothered with such discussions.After decades of violent and brutal resistance, white Southerners largely acquiesced to the desegregation of other public places, of parks, restaurants, city buses and libraries. Contact in those spaces tended to be superficial, and if white people did not want to be around \textbf{black} people, they could simply avoid them. Schools were different. Nearly every American child, then and now, attended a public school. Schools were intimate. For hours each day, students sat next to one another, learned with one another, influenced one another. And also, most frightening, fell in love with one another. In the spring of 1954, as the Supreme Court was deliberating over the Brown case, President Dwight Eisenhower invited Chief Justice Earl Warren to dinner, where he attempted to explain that white Southerners 'are not bad people. All they are concerned about is to see that their sweet little girls are not required to sit in school alongside some big overgrown \textbf{Negro}.' But even more than that, Americans saw schools as the primary drivers of opportunity and success, and white Americans had no desire to share access to the best schools and educational resources for which they'd always held the monopoly.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Negro, Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/285 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.053 \\  \hline

To top it all of and there is much more, we are turning away from God very rapidly turning to other gods who our fore parents knew not gods that came up lately like allah that be no god at all, as we begun to away to allah and reject our true and living God so he also is turning the muslim to him in place of us who turn away for his kingdom shall be full.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Gay, Nationality & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Nationality - General, Sexual Identity - General, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality & \cellcolor{green!27}6/363 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.653 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Desegregation in the US was a massive, well-thought out project that failed spectacularly and we generally don't think about why or how today.  The boomers largely acquiesced to the \textbf{racist} demands of Southern states and conservative voters, and by extension doomed our populace to a deepening racial conflict which is ultimately superficial.  Economists would call this ‚Äòcircular cumulative causation' - we ended segregation, which amplified tribal animosity, which further divided sub-populations within the US, which justified (in the minds of the citizenry) the fact of segregation in the first place.  Rinse and repeat, it gets worse and worse.  And although young people are less \textbf{racist} than ever, they also have less experience with people of other colors than their predecessors.  Personally I think we need to re-evaluate the policy of desegregation in schools and more than likely re-instate some version of it, if for no other reason than to open up the opportunities afforded by rich, white-majority schools to poorer people of color.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/163 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.227 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I would love it if my son dated a \textbf{black} \textbf{woman}. They are correct that interracial friendships and marriages are the best way to eliminate \textbf{racism}. In 1912, a religious leader of the Baha'i Faith came to America, among other things, to help eliminate \textbf{racism} in America. He taught that interracial marriage was one way to end \textbf{racism}. He saw that a \textbf{black} lawyer Louis Gregory and a white \textbf{woman} were fond of each other. Going back and forth between them, ‚ÄòAbdu'l-Bah√° encourages them to marry, which they eventually decided on their own to do. Louisa was also many years older than Louis. They loved each other very much, and although their interracial marriage was not the first in the US, it was rare enough that it was still illegal in many states. Look how far we've come since then that interracial marriage is as \textbf{common} as it is, and not to mention legal in the entire country. When we look at the present or near past, it doesn't seem like anything is improving. But look how far we've come in just the last 100 years, and imagine how far we'll be in the next 100. It would be wonderful if change happened faster, but at least it's happening.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Common, Racism, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}8/209 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.828 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small For two countries that are neighbors, if you asked kids in Canada the same thing, you would get different results. We have \textbf{racism} up here (especially in a certain province) but not to the same extent as in the US - we don't talk about \textbf{race} as much as the US does. In elections, we never talk about the "white" vote, "\textbf{black}" vote, "Hispanic" vote, etc. - I understand the important and evolution of that but when \textbf{race} is presented in such a way that segregates, you end up getting certain perceptions. I also think "multiculturalism" (Canada) provides a different experience than "melting pot" (US). When I ask my kids about the new kid who started school, they never talk about \textbf{race} and even I ask about their origins, my kids often don't know - they are very racially-blind. In general that is a good thing so there's less potential for discrimination but in the same breath, it's important that my kids understand the struggles, for example, of the first nations in Canada just because it's part of our Canadian history.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Race, Racism & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}5/181 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.762 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Hi! I wrote this On another Post and not everyone would be able to see so I decided to Repost it. I like how people are trying to blame us \textbf{Black} people when actually we are the Victims of Racial Abuse, People have been Killed for being \textbf{Black} and when they are killed White People try to block it out, for example The following people were ever punished for who they are or had to fight for Equal Rights: Rosa Parks, Emmet Till, Stephan Laurence, Martin Luther King Jr, Mark Duggan. All of these people Victims of \textbf{Racism}. Now I'm not blaming White People currently Living because they are not Suspects of what had happened to these people but there are still Racists out there. If you don't like our Skin Colour or our Culture, Fine just don't say anything to offend us, but when you start Abusing us Physically and Verbally it's Classed as a Hate Crime even if it's a Joke it's still going to be Logged and you will therefore gain a Criminal Record, This is how \textbf{Black} Lives get takenBecause people just don't know when to stop!

You told it exactly like it is. If only people would listen and try to understand the reality of \textbf{Black} life.  Yes, they tell us to get over the past (mainly because they themselves don't want to deal with it), while at the same time minimizing and or denying the Trauma that we face everyday from police brutality, the frustration from the undermining of our contributions in the workplace, the little micro-aggressions in stores and other public places, the criminalization of damn near everything we do so they can falsely pontificate about \textbf{Black} crime-inflating those statistics and discarding the truth about how these actually break down.  These things are not relics of the past that we should forget about and "move on."  These are daily occurrences that we can't get away from and we try not to internalize.  The assaults on our \textbf{mental} and physical well being can be   As that simple self-satisfied smirk when they know that they have hurt you, to that devastating police shooting when you die.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Proud to be white. I have no problem with the color of someone's skin. What I have a problem with are aspects of \textbf{black} culture in America.

It is ripe with ignorance, \textbf{racism} (toward whites), violence, lack of education, drug use, womanising, ignoring responsibility, encouraging a criminal mentality, encouraging racial segregation and blaming one racial demographic for all of their ills.Basically, a 20-something with \textbf{zero} talent (as if rap required any) and a second grade spelling level gets popped in the rear by Diddy just to get an EP dropped and gets his body covered in tats in an attempt to restore some sense of masculinity....and for what? For the purpose of reaching a generation of youths and inspiring them to be and act as ignorant as possible and make poor life choices that will follow them for the rest of their days.Being an uneducated, uncivilized, criminal, animalistic fool is \textbf{nothing} to take pride in. \textbf{Race}, upbringing, environment and money is no excuse when given the opportunity to rise above it like so many have.We need more positive influences like MLK, Dr. Ben Carson, Neil Tyson and Candice Owens.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Says the melaninated person who just offered an unsolicited opinion about someone else's skin because they lack self awareness. The irony. Quick science lesson about melanin. It was needed to block out the harmful UV radiation of the sun for people who lived close the the equator, which gets lots of sun exposure. Without out it, the species most likely would have had high skin cancer rates that would have wiped out the species. Yay evolution! Oh but wait, when people with melanin migrated to more northern climates, where there was far less sun exposure, they had to lose the melanin so the skin could absorb more of the important nutrients from the sun, like vitamin D. If they didn't lose the melanin, they never would have survived the new climate, and that's how we ended up with white people. Yay evolution!Ohhh and guess what else was naturally selected for in the harsher northern climates? Yeah, a higher IQ, because it was suddenly more difficult to survive in a climate that required shelter and better planning skills, so it also explains why white people have an on average 20 point higher IQ. Yay evolution. It's why every white country in the world is a thriving industrialized first world \textbf{nation}, while every brown country is a third world shithole that looks like it's stuck in the stone \textbf{age}.I'm glad all the melanin worked out for you guys xD.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small AKV V I'm \textbf{African} American and I have to agree with a lot of the things you said. It's definitely true how we are so quick to come together when the white man does something to us, but ignore \textbf{black} on \textbf{black} crime. Also, I used to work in a restaurant and I'd notice that any time i was significantly under tipped or got no tip at all, it was from a \textbf{black} table and it was extremely frustrating. A lot of white people have been better to me than my own \textbf{black} people. It seems the women are always beefing or in competition with each other. It's really sad. But I also know that a lot of \textbf{black} people may not be as fortunate as me, being raised by parents who care and having a good education. Because really that's what it comes down to. It's a continuous cycle of parents not caring and lack of education which I know stems from lack of funding and the war on drugs back when crack cocaine was pumped into \textbf{black} communities, destroying the family unit. At the end of the day though, people are people. When i served at that restaurant, even though I knew \textbf{black} people tipped me the least, I still served them like they would tip me 20. Because like you said, not all \textbf{black} people are that way. Many \textbf{black} people tipped me correctly as well. So I hope your biases don't dictate how you treat or think of \textbf{black} people you don't know. I've been told my whole life by my mother that the three groups that don't like \textbf{black} people the most are Asians, Jews, and Puerto Ricans. And while that may be true, considering how many times ive seen those groups associate themselves with \textbf{black} people, if i come across a Jewish person, or a Chinese person, I'm not going to assume they don't like me and act in such a way, I'm going to see them as a person like myself until they give me reason to believe they don't like me. Because I know a person's \textbf{race} or religion doesn't determine whether they like me or not, it's their individual personality. Same  thing should go for \textbf{black} people when it comes to work ethic and intelligence.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}African, Black, Race & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}15/384 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.906 \\  \hline

He would tell me he would like to be white. I was furious,  I love my \textbf{black} people. So, I picked up on what the problem was very quick becz I would volunteer in the school events and I would see how the school treated me, it was a culture there \textbf{black} people were inferior even at the elementary schools my son was getting bullied for his \textbf{black} skin and the teacher was planning it off as kids just being kids I was furious.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Well lets see,childrens opinions at 5 and 6 are different because \textbf{black} kids arent statistical criminals yet,but by 13 most are. So when Anderson reports that the kids parents told them they cant be friends with the \textbf{black} kids,maybe he shouldve reported the REST of the story about the WHY they didnt want them to be friends. Easy to paint a picture here Anderson,when you only intend to  provide one side of the narrative.  I used to believe i could be friends with \textbf{black} people and supported their beliefs of being prejudiced against and their unfair treatment,until i found out how \textbf{black} people really felt about white people and their beliefs that all whites cant be trusted and will throw them under the bus first chance they get. I used to think of blacks and whites as equals,but now knowing what i know,i will never be friends with a \textbf{black} person again. They dont want change even when they can see change right in front of them. They keep perpetrating the victim mentality and blaming every white person for slavery,when this generation had absolutely \textbf{nothing} to do with it. The \textbf{age} of guilt is over for me,and i distrust every \textbf{black} person i see because i know they mostly have the agenda of making white people pay,even if they havent been wronged. \textbf{Age} \textbf{old} wanting something for \textbf{nothing} scenario . Well there arent slaves in america today,i did not own slaves,my parents did not own slaves,my grandparents did not own slaves,so in my opinion i did not wrong \textbf{black} people and i dont owe them a damn thing. And for the way they think all white people owe them something,i look down upon them now. To me they are lesser individuals because they rely on not their own skill set and ability to make it in life,but depend on another person giving them something they have neither earned or deserve. Anderson needs to do a segment on that i think. A true journalist reports facts and both sides,a liberal leftist only gives you their spin on the facts without presenting the other side.

The reason why we have such racial conflict today is precisely because people lack the insight to discriminate based on relevant qualities. Color not being one of them.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Firstly, respect is earned. Secondly, disparities in color resulting from evolutionary adaptions to different climates are not merely limited to pigments. But physiological characteristics, such as the large flared noses of Africans which helped dehumidify in desert climates, and other biological traits developed and inherited to live in such a climate are evident. Similarly, it is strange to believe that people, developed under different circumstances would somehow all equally develop our powers of intelligence. Here's a quote."We do not yet adequately understand the way in which the different environments in the world have selected over time the genes which determine our capacity to do different things. The overwhelming desire of society today is to assume that equal powers of reason are a universal heritage of humanity. It may well be. But simply wanting this to be the case is not enough. This is not science.To question this is not to give in to \textbf{racism}.

That \textbf{black} colour is not uniform throughout that continent even within the same latitudes. However people who are located within the equatorial regions have a darker skin colour than those on either north or south of the equator. Also variations in skin colour depends on the altitudes and temps in those locations. You can physically experience this if you traverse these regions in AFRICA.This means if you are lighter skinned naturally and you spend some period in a low area with higher temps you will \textbf{tan} darker hence protect your body from dangerous X-rays from the sun. This happens to all native Africans and on top of that they do not necessarily need hats or sun cream lotions or indeed anything to protect themselves from the sun's side effects.

To this day we are still best friends, we had our children together,  raised them together as family (light/dark skinned children) therefore,  they accepted differences within there own culture and outside cultures. By my family being multiracially mixed I taught my children the value of ALL races. I raised my children to speak articulaticulary and I dressed them well. This carried them through adulthood. And for those who say \textbf{black} people get harrassed by the way they dress (i.e.: your intepretation like "thugs" whatever the fuck that is supossed to mean) my son wasn't raised to dress in such a manner. He didn't dress that way entering adulthood and still doesn't but "YET" he has and still is constantly harrassed by the police. He carries himself well and is educated and has become well versed with the law due to this constant harrassment. Being a \textbf{racist} is a "learned" behavior.

And before you judge me, my father is bi-racial but he is dark-skinned,  my mom was fair-skinned, her father was bi-racial (my family make-up is very complex prior to my birth). I have 5 grandchildren. 2 are half-white, 1 is half-puerto rican and the other 2 are \textbf{African} American of no mix. The last thing they see when they are together are color, just as their parents were with their cousins (my best friend's children as thasts how we raised them as family). I love them not only because they are my grandchildren but they also add more diversity a multi-cultural family.  We need to "OPEN OUR EYES" and we what we are doing to our children and OUR WORLD an OUR FUTURE. WE have the power to stop it if we just change our attitides towarda \textbf{race}. There are horrible people out there no matter what color they are, it just happens that \textbf{African}  Americans are racially profilled more so than ANY other culture and more likely to either become incarcerated, killed by one of their own,  or shot by a police officer in a wrongful situation.

There are plenty of things that are not directly translatable. There are things that you can say that initiate certain types of feelings and thoughts that are quite distinct to other languages.Language is a lifestyle, and a culture. Example Cantonese culture to "Chinese" culture, different vocab, it is more a language rather than a dialect (think French to English) many consider themselves an \textbf{ethnic} group, and the Chinese government has policies to wipe out the language group and the \textbf{ethnicity} through migration, and the education system, beating children who speak it. Much like how they are dealing with the Tibetans.Another point on multiethnic countries is that they do have strife. Example the Balkans, South Africa, Germany, Syria, Turkey, even the history of migration into the US didn't work out so well for the natives. History is littered with multiethnic societies in conflict, and that conflict slows human development.  Given that, you might as well have less multuracialism.However lets take a step back, you are looking at the world as if every single person on this planet is born with equal opportunity to become what ever it is they want.

By the time they are 4-8 kids will still be friends but will realize a difference, that really doesn't matter to most kids, but the change begins when they look at the attitude of both side of their parents, how they treat each other or the child.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I never experienced prejudice until I lived in south Tulsa Oklahoma and later extreme \textbf{racism} in Utah. Living amongst the Mormon I then saw for my self why these whites are prejudice against blacks in general. Their Joseph Smith who they claim is a prophet (actually a dead false prophet) taught them and unscriptural teaching that blacks were an accurst people because of what happened between Cain and Abel. I had to go back to my bible and read all of genesis to see what they were talking about. Cain was a harvester and his brother Abel was a shepherd. Cain's offering to God wasn't his best and therefore was rejected and Abel's offering was accepted. Cain became jealous with his brother. God saw that and even warned Cain to change his heart and way of thinking. Cain didn't listen and murdered his brother. When God found out he banished Cain and cursed THE GROUND HE WALKED ON meaning (as a harvester) \textbf{nothing} would grow. So how is that translated into Cain himself was cursed and his offspring came out with \textbf{black} skin? Which also isn't in the Bible. The Mormons then claimed they finally realized during the 70s that it wasn't a scriptural teaching. Yet the prejudices were still there. Only difference is now blacks are welcome to their church but not whole heartedly. God wouldn't sent his son to die for all mankind just to place whites as his chosen people and the chosen religion destroying other people's lives.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I used to be very \textbf{racist}... Please listen to my story and be open minded. In elementary school I had almost never thought of \textbf{race}. My parents were never \textbf{racist} towards anyone. The first time I heard about \textbf{racism} was when we were learning about it in 4th grade. Once I went to middle school things started to change. Compared to my elementary school there were a lot more \textbf{black} people.  Now, this is were it might get iffy for some people, so please have an open mind. It was mostly the \textbf{black} kids who were rude to the teachers, and being disrespectful, every day in the hallway, it was them who would make fun of white people and be \textbf{racist} to them, but then complain about how they faced \textbf{racism}. At the same time, in my classes I was exposed to a lot of anti-white teaching. On my own, I had been learning about how the white population was declining, while the rest of the world wasn't I saw how the glory of European culture had been deluded for the sake of not sounding \textbf{racist}/pc, and I hated this. I grew very angry, and directed my anger towards \textbf{black} people. I felt as if they were taking over in there own way, and would lead to the destruction of European culture and heritage pride by being anti European, and using \textbf{racism} as there sword and shield. This of course, made me extremely angry. I started hating all \textbf{black} people that I saw. I hated these people with a passion. No, I did not do it out of ignorance, and I am not a stupid person(most of the time.) I also had some very positive experiences with a few \textbf{black} people, so it wasn't lack of experience.  In 8th grade though, I started becoming more religious. To cut the story short, I stopped hating \textbf{black} people. My hate had clouded my judgment . I learned to not judge to fast, and not always judge based on certain characteristics. To all the anti \textbf{racist} \textbf{black} people, be careful what you say about or too people, words have power, enough power to make me \textbf{racist}.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Race, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}16/363 & \cellcolor{green!27}4.408 \\  \hline

He was also good friends a few blacks, and was fond of a \textbf{black} kid he met while working on his lawn.

We have bigger and better weapons for \textbf{dumb} and small minded people to kill other people.

The \textbf{black} see's it for what they want and the young boy asked "Why?" when he couldn't visit.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Soluchi \{Michael Jackson Lookalike, Dancer, VFX} - Don't fool yourself. Lots of intelligent people are \textbf{racist} and/or bigoted in other ways, too. A lot of it is how people are raised. The \textbf{apple} usually doesn't fall far from the tree. That's why we still have so many problems with bigotry.Also, a lot of people (including many intelligent people) have a negative sense of self and/or they're unhappy with their life. Some of those people try to build themselves up by tearing other people down, and some blame people outside of their in-group for the circumstances of their life.For example, there are a lot of people who haven't achieved much as an individual (by their own standards and/or by society's). So, they claim "whiteness" and the achievements of other people of European descent, to assert that they're superior to people of another \textbf{race}. Same deal with people who claim "blackness" and the achievements of other people of \textbf{African} descent. Or people blame illegal Latino immigrants or \textbf{African} Americans for taking their jobs and/or using up all of the tax revenue on welfare, when ridiculously wealthy entities in the U.S. can get away with paying no taxes at all or much less than they should pay, employers hire illegal Latino immigrants because they can get away with paying them a lot less, not providing benefits, etc., and some "white" Americans just won't accept that an \textbf{African} American is just as qualified as they are - let alone more qualified. And the \textbf{crazy} thing is that the concept of \textbf{race} is all BS. There aren't separate and distinct races of humans, from a genetic perspective. There hasn't been enough genetic isolation to produce separate and distinct races of humans from a genetic perspective. \textbf{Race} is merely a poorly thought out social construct, based upon stereotypes that don't stand up to scientific scrutiny. But it's a huge part of our culture. There is even a lot of \textbf{race}-based scientific research. But none of it is scientifically valid because none of it uses discrete samples. Even many scientists are behind the current scientific research of human genetics, and they've been raised to believe in the concept of different races of humans - just like most other people.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African, Apple, Crazy, Race, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Ethnicity - Native-American, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}9/374 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.406 \\  \hline

She thinks that she's fighting colorism by being a colorist herself - against lighter-skinned \textbf{African} Americans. She also attacks dark-skinned \textbf{African} American men, as a group. She's all messed up from being mistreated as a child. I tried to talk her out of reacting like that, but she ignores me and anyone else who doesn't go along with what she says. Or she makes videos to attack us (lumping us all together and misrepresenting a lot of individual's views in the process).She has also done something positive though, by starting a magazine featuring beautiful dark-skinned women of \textbf{African} descent.And beyond colorism, there has also been violent tribalism in some \textbf{African} countries. Some of it was promoted by European imperialism. But a lot of it precedes European imperialism in Africa (or at least those regions of Africa).We have to take responsibility for our own behavior and do what we can to improve our quality of life.

If you know History, you'll see that in Europe 'til a few dacades and in the US 'til now, they haven't the same opportunities. Now I'll be talking about american reality because this problem is waaaay bigger in there. \textbf{Black} people live in ghettos, tend to be victim of prejudice, don't get good jobs so they can't live in a propper home, etc. But I'm sure that most white people living in ghettos lacks of good grades too because if you don't eat propperly, if you know no one believe in you it's dificult. Being physicaly stronger... they tend to be, yes. Asians being smart. The asians living in the US most of them came from Japan that is a very educated country, so it's natural that they get good grades (I don't know if this is true, I'm talking about your "research"). They have less ambitions than white in America? Japan and China are very competitive societies, and in their countries they are, so I can't see your point... "Upper-class blacks commit more crimes than lower-class whites." Are you bullshit me? Even if it was Upper-class blacks commit more crimes than upper-class whites I wouldn't believe it. I know that lower-class blacks commit more crimes than lower-class whites because of the way in your country they still haven't rights and they still live in shitty conditions. All of these shit doesn't have directly to do with the color of the skin but with social problems. You talk about  melting pot. The melting pot isn't a good thing "per se" because shows that you needed to leave your country because you couldn't make it in your own country, but I can't seevthe problem in having people from another "colors" living in a country. In my country there are people from some \textbf{african} countries and Brazil and dispite the situation isn't what it should be, here if a white police officer shoot a \textbf{black} guy he will be locked up and no one give him a hug and look the other way. You talk about "brainwashing techniques" and "diversity  propaganda". In a country where people aren't \textbf{racist}, for the most part, like in my country, people get along naturally, so diversity is a natural thing, so that makes no sense to me. You say that people naturally prefere to be with "their own kind over others". Curious, I'm 43 years \textbf{old}, I always had 3,4,5 \textbf{black} classmates and we all get along whites and blacks and I work with children for many years and I've  NEVER seen one single case of \textbf{race} segregation.

So, what would be your similar ancestry, beliefs and culture? Talking about genetics, honey, the color of the skin is dued to an insignificant amount of genes in millions of them and even if it was true, genetic diversity is a good thing, not a bad one. Why do you think there are so many illnesses in the royal houses across the Europe? They married between theirselves and all the genetic illnesses were passed from one place to another. Once again, your theory is wrong.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@athollywoodjewels, "\textbf{Racism}" is just one of many "devisive" mindsets among Americans  in general. In fact, most if not all of the "isms" we suffer from in this once-great country of ours that keeps us polarized, catagorized and pitted against one another are a direct result of institutionalized indoctrination at every level that we're exposed to at every turn. It's easy, therefore popular to blame the "parents" of children/adults when it comes to things like \textbf{racism}, \textbf{sexism}, heterosexism, nativism, colorism/shadism, \textbf{classism}, etc., but the truth is that we've all been brainwashed by the very institutions, organizations and groups of people who're the most vocal in the fight against these unsavory and oppressive types of social oppression. That's right folks, it are the teachers, professors, preachers, politicians, Hollywood celebrities, civil rights organizations, as well as the establishment media and the scientists, sociologists and other so-called "experts" they rely upon to "educate the masses" who're truly to blame. In other words, if you think that the state or a public education is going to fix the very crisis that they themselves have collectively and intentionally created, I've got a basement bargain price on some oceanfront property for you in Bagdad. The solution to all of these societal ills we face is for American individuals and their parents and grandparents to stop relying upon someone else to "educate" them. In fact, all of us need to RE-educate "ourselves" and one another. Why? Because virtually everything we think we know as a society is essentially the EXACT OPPOSITE of the SIMPLE TRUTH! We're just too "educated," dumbed down and \textbf{blind} to SEE!  Oh sure, there will ALWAYS be a \textbf{racist} here or there. That is a natural human tendency, depending on an individuals own personal experiences in life. For example, if a white \textbf{woman} is beaten and raped by a group of \textbf{black} men, she and those familar with that horrible experience are going to forever have a different view about \textbf{black} men. That's called life. The thing with "racists" however is that they should not be given a soapbox. Like children, when it comes to important public debate on \textbf{racism}, they should be seen, not heard. Furthermore, reverse-\textbf{racism} is real, and anti-racists do just as much harm to our society as do the actual racists themselves, if not more. Bottom line: NO VICTIM - NO CRIME! it should not be "illegal" to "be" a "\textbf{racist}," nor should racists be punished by society. "Stick and stones...." remember? If someone wants to call someone else a \textbf{nigger}, so be it! Let that be their problem, not yours or ours.

A great deal of the focus was on what was being done by the UK government to people from the so-called Windrush generation. One \textbf{woman} objected against the use of terms like brown or \textbf{black} and wanted the organizers to use the phrase Caribbean-African. In doing so, she moved all other people who are not lily white outside the wall behind which she wanted to retreat to feel safe (understandably, as horrible things have happened to people who are part of the Windrush generation and their descendents, people plucked out of career, cancer treatment, PhD study or retirement and suddenly deported or put in detention, passports confiscated and what not - ILLEGALLY). I understand that her identity is not the same as her skin color, but I also understand that many more people in the UK who aren't lily white are abused and discriminated against and aren't Caribbean-African.

I chose my friends, not her. She never treated my friends of color any differently than she did me. As I got older, we moved a lot because my mom was  divorced and raising 3 kids on her own, I lived any many different neighborhoods and attended many different schools. Always being the new kid was never fun, except in the diverse schools. White kids were not as accepting or friendly to me, and I am white. But at diverse schools, almost from day one, I always made friends with \textbf{black} and non white Hispanic girls. I cant explain why it seemed to always be that way, but that was my experience. We always lived in poor neighborhoods unless we stayed with my aunt. Her neighborhood was all white. My best memories in school are from the diverse schools. As an adult, I again was accepted by people of color before white people even glanced my direction at work. And I remember at At\&t in Dallas, my first and best friend made their was a \textbf{black} \textbf{woman} from Chicago. We just clicked from day one. We went through training together. After training we still carried on like in training, we were inseparable on breaks and lunches. As time went by, some the local \textbf{black} ladies we worked with began to get an attitude towards us. We would walk by and they would say something in a mumble and indistinguishable but loud and clearly we could here, That white girl!. I will never forget Sandra on the day she had enough of it and she went off on them. Asked them what there problem was and told them that we were friends and had a lot in \textbf{common} and that is why we were always together. I had never been more proud to be someone's friend as I was that day. She was truly a blessing to have as a friend. We lost touch through the years. She moved back to Chicago and life gets you caught up. But I think of her all the time. Maybe I will find her again? I hope so. But as I have always been, I remain a person who sees people.

No one has ever seen him!" They only began this rhetoric when people started questioning those white depictions and contrasting them with the BIBLICAL description of Jesus Christ. And notice, no one alive has seen Socrates, Plato, Shakespeare, King Herod, etc. So how is any movie, history class/teacher, etc. portraying those figures as "white" men with no question? Omni King's response is a classic deflection of the truth according to the BIBLE - the book that accounts the life of Jesus Christ and describes him as BURNT (past participle of the word) Bronze skin and white (color) like wool (texture) hair.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!5}1/176 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.568 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Imagine the white kids reaction? Wow! You guys are some \textbf{racist} motherfukers pushing division. Why don't you focus more on just teaching children that we're all humans and are the same, rather than making it look that we're very different and seeing what they think about a fucking inkblot test(might as well be.. what do you see here?) What a fucking joke. All American oughta be ashamed of them Goddamn selves. First thing you should do as a parent is turn off your stupid fucking television. More \textbf{racist} and class demeaning shows are there, including commercials, than anywhere else. Then, you should get your children out to meet people of other races, open conversations with these people, you show your children that it's okay to talk to them, stand next to them, befriend them, because what they see on the TV, tells them that we are all enemies. If you watch TV, you're only strengthening that idea, with you and your own children. And in that aspect you are a horrible parent. The government is guilty of doing this. You let them do it. Apparently this is the life that you want for your children and future Generations right? Because if you don't stand up it will only get worse. We are humans. That's it. Think of it this way.. I have two identical Moby Dick books, one has a \textbf{y\textbf{e\textbf{llow}}} cover, and the other has a blue cover. What do you think the differences in these two books are? They have the exact same thing inside yet only the outside cover is different. When you open the pages, they say the exact same thing, the thoughts are the same, the words are the same, pages are all the same color. yet that tiny difference of the color of the outside of it makes you think what? That they are different books? They both say Moby Dick on the front don't they? So why would I think they were different? I would just think that someone made this exactly identical book with a different \textbf{colored} cover. There is \textbf{nothing} wrong with either book, both books have the same ending and beginning, just like us, both books were published the same, and both will be read from front to back, organized by chapter that are exactly the same, written by the same person, and published by the same company, and just like us, although we are the same book, we have different \textbf{colored} covers, all different colors, yet we start the same and in the same way, the same things are inside of us, and contrary to popular belief we all share a \textbf{common} goal, to survive. It would be so much easier for us to survive as a group, if we stop trying to divide ourselves in minuscule ways, that really have no meaning. Life has meaning. It should be important, all life should be important. It shouldn't matter where you were raised, what color your skin is, what color your eyes are, what color your hair is, how long your fingernails are, the size of your body parts, or the functionality of your body parts. None of that should matter. The only thing that should matter is that we are all humans, and we need to work together to help each other. You let the government separate us by \textbf{race}, class, political view, neighborhood, \textbf{gender}, School, even occupation. I know if we all stood up, with the same voice, the government would have no leg to stand on. The words that come out of their mouth, that we are all so different, that we need different colleges, that we need different Grant options, that we need different neighborhoods, that we need different foods and products, and that we need different clothes and languages are not true. They are fucking lies. And you people know it. You know we all need the same things, we all need a good place to live, we all need a school where the education is not bullshit and full of agendas, we need health and happiness, we need to be able to express ourselves, and although you might believe we are opposites, all these things make us the same. So no matter what the government tells you, I'm here to tell you that they are wrong. I'm here to tell you that they know they're wrong, and they enjoy what they're doing to us. Because as long as we are divided and fighting each other, we won't see what they're doing.  we definitely won't be fighting them.

And then he punched me in the rib.

He didn't even look scared when I mentioned self-defense. He just looked pissed off.

The next time I saw him, he tried to punch me some more and a cop heard me warning him off so I didn't HAVE to use self-defense this time.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Sure \textbf{Black} Goku : Here is PROOF that Obama is a \textbf{Race} Baiter/\textbf{Racist}. You won't read it nor accept the facts because  Progressive Liberals can't handle the truth . 1.  Under the direction of Obama The Justice Department dropped an open-and-shut voter intimidation case against the New \textbf{Black} Panther Party. It was essentially a declaration that his administration would use the Voting Rights Act to protect only certain races.2. Obama pushed a steady stream of false claims that America was an inherently \textbf{racist} society with a biased judicial and law enforcement system. Obama rekindled a racial divide that had been steadily disappearing in American society.3.  Remember the infamous BEER SUMMIT  when Obama attacked the Police? He had NO business interjecting himself in what was a state issue.Here is what Obama said, and he said this to stir up racial tension.  "I don't know,  not having been there and not seeing all the facts , what  role \textbf{race} played in that ,' Obama said after Gates's arrest. 'But I think it's  fair to say , number one , any of us would be  pretty angry ; number two ,  that the  Cambridge police acted stupidly in arresting somebody when there was already proof that they were in their own home*, and,  *number three ,  what I think we know separate and apart from this incident is that there's a long history in this country of \textbf{African} Americans and Latinos being stopped by law enforcement . disproportionately.'Obama's Racists Bullshit on the Trayvon Martin Case . Judge for yourself: "When Trayvon Martin was first shot I said that this could have been my son. Another way of saying that is Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago," the president said. This had \textbf{NOTHING} to do with Trayvon being \textbf{black}.  Obama went on to say > If a white male teen was involved in the same kind of scenario... both the outcome and the aftermath might have been different." There is a residual discomfort and political cost when President Obama speaks as a member of the \textbf{African}-American community rather than as an entirely colour-blind Commander in Chief.  ObamaIsARaceBaiter. More \textbf{Race} Baiting by Obama : Baltimore Police Report Shows Obama Jumped Gun Again On \textbf{Racism} Charge .Racial Politics : President Obama has a tendency to wade into local crime cases, second-guessing police decisions and making wild accusations of \textbf{racism}, without knowing all the facts. Baltimore is his latest faux pas.Obama strongly suggested that Baltimore police were to blame for the death of a young \textbf{black} man who died while in custody.Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old convicted drug dealer who'd been arrested 18 times previously, resisted another arrest April 12. He was so violent, he required additional restraints and a \textbf{paddy} wagon to take him to jail."Our laws were not applied evenly in the case of Mr. Gray," Obama intoned, "and accountability needs to exist."He presumed that Gray had had "his spine snapped" while struggling with cops. But once again, it looks like the president spoke prematurely.A police report leaked to the Washington Post shows that Gray likely caused his own injuries by banging his head against the wall of the police transport van in a tirade over his bust.More \textbf{Race} Baiting by Obama :There was a similar rush to judgment in the  Michael Brown  case, when Obama and his attorney general reinforced the \textbf{black} community's belief that the 18-year-old \textbf{African}-American was gunned down by a white cop as he surrendered, hands up. It didn't happen that way.Yet Ferguson, like Baltimore, burned. And Obama hasn't learned from that tragic error."Since Ferguson, we have seen too many instances of what appears to be police officers interacting with individuals ‚Äî primarily \textbf{African} American, often poor ‚Äî in ways that have raised troubling questions," he said."And it comes up, it seems like, once every couple of weeks .. . . This is a crisis ... . This has been going on for a long time. This is not new, and we shouldn't pretend that it's new."He's right about there being a crisis. But \textbf{black} crime, not police bias or brutality, is at the heart of it. The only one pretending otherwise is the president.More \textbf{Race} Baiting by Obama : There is no precedent for Barack Obama's relentless attacks on the nation's police officers and criminal-justice system. Simply put, the man twice elected to the country's highest office routinely and repeatedly charges that cops and the courts are awash in systematic racial bias. 'Too many young men of color,' the president told the Congressional \textbf{Black} Caucus in September 2014, 'feel targeted by law enforcement, guilty of walking while \textbf{black}, or driving while \textbf{black}, judged by stereotypes that fuel fear and resentmentRemember the Marine Veteran Andrew Tahmooressi , Tragically, it has been just over  200 days that Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi ,  a decorated U.S. Marine Corps combat veteran , has languished in a Mexican jail . The reason why Obama has done \textbf{NOTHING} for our veteran is because Tahmooressi is Caucasian . In April, Tahmooressi crossed the southern border at San Ysidro by mistake after taking a wrong turn; he was stopped by Mexican officials who found three U.S.-registered guns in his truck. Since Mexico has extremely strict firearms laws, he was taken into custody.The ensuing six months have been a nightmare for 25-year-old Tahmooressi, who has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress (PTS) stemming from his combat service, and his family. In April, Tahmooressi even attempted to take his own life. Mexican authorities have dragged their feet on the case.In response, several U.S. government authorities have shown diligence and commitment to the cause of securing Tahmooressi's release. The U.S. State Department has maintained an open line of communication with the Mexican government on the matter, and the House Foreign Affairs Committee has advocated forcefully for the Marine's release.Yet missing in action is the voice of Tahmooressi's commander in chief‚ÄîPresident Barack Obama. When will the president weigh in on behalf of this decorated combat veteran held unjustly in foreign captivity?Six months into Tahmooressi's captivity, the president has yet to place a phone call to his counterpart in Mexico, President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, to discuss the matter and to urge the Marine's release. But from the president, \textbf{nothing} is heard and when asked, the president's spokesman punts responsibility to the State Department.Nor has the president even picked up the phone to contact Tahmooressi's mother, Jill, who has worked tirelessly on her son's behalf and recently testified before a Congressional subcommittee about her family's plight (a hearing at which I also testified on Tahmooressi's behalf, along with talk show host and Marine veteran Montel Williams).But the president's time is limited, one might argue, since he has to deal with a deteriorating situation in the Middle East, a potential Ebola epidemic and countless worries both domestic and global.True enough‚Äîbut one can't help but to notice that Obama's tight schedule still allows him plenty of time to attend fundraisers where he rubs elbows with wealthy Democratic donors and Hollywood A-listers like Gwyneth Paltrow. And he certainly hasn't allowed any global disturbances‚Äîlike terrorists beheading an innocent American journalist or an Ebola briefing‚Äîto keep him from playing golf.But the president can't jump into every issue that pops up in the news cycle, you say. Perhaps‚Äîunless you consider how many issues the president has given his personal attention over the years. This president is inordinately fond of injecting himself into events that a wiser leader would have sidestepped or left to others.In his first year in office, he flew to Copenhagen to personally lobby for Chicago's failed bid to host the 2016 Olympics; since then he's hosted 'beer summits,' commented openly on legal cases in the news (like the Trayvon Martin shooting) and carved out time in his schedule to film a pro-Obamacare video for the humor website 'Funny or Die' with comedian Zach Galifianakis.President Obama is perfectly content to apply the weight of his office to advance the causes he cares about. So his failure to wield his power on behalf of Sgt. Tahmooressi raises a pointed question: Does he even care?Earlier this year, Obama laid down a strong standard for detained service members. In May, the president stood in the Rose Garden to proudly announce that his administration had negotiated the release of U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl from captivity in Afghanistan, trading five \textbf{terrorist} killers to the Taliban in exchange for a soldier who reportedly deserted his front-line unit less than two months into his first tour of duty.

Anthony Johnson  (b. c. 1600 ‚Äì d. 1670)  was a \textbf{black} Angolan who achieved freedom in the early 17th-century Colony of Virginia after serving his term of indenture. He became a property owner that owned slaves, and was one of the first people in Virginia to have his right to own a slave legally recognized. Held as an indentured servant in 1621, he earned his freedom after several years, and was granted land by the colony.[1] He later became a successful tobacco farmer in Maryland. He attained great wealth after having been an indentured servant and has been referred to as ''the \textbf{black} patriarch' of the first community of \textbf{Negro} property owners in America".As an American Portuguese, Irish, Scottish decent (Caucasian) I had \textbf{nothing} to do with what happened decades ago and blacks today have never been oppressed or denied their rights under the constitution.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Go to gibbs high. I'm not saying it's the \textbf{race} but it's the area. Going to a majority \textbf{black}, low income area, strong opinionated school in south st.pete florida was the worst years of my life. The area where the school was caused the kids to have constant fights, bullying, lockdowns, drug busts, people completely disrespecting their elders and their own parents and also parents trying to fight kids and staff. It was pathetic. That school was a nightmare I got bullied for being white and for the program I was in. (the school had art and technology majors. Art was the majority of white kids but had few people and the technology was almost completely \textbf{black} and was used to goof off by most kids. There was also traditional which meant no major-also mostly \textbf{black}.-) I was a good kid and people used to bully me into giving them my work to copy. I was bullied for having dyed hair, I was bullied for everything I did and how I looked. It wasnt just the white people who were bullied even my \textbf{black} friends got bullied for "talking white" or "acting white" when all they did was use proper grammar and had decent attitudes towards people. You'd hear "\textbf{black} lives matter" which I totally agree on, we should all be equal but it was almost always used in the context of "I'm better than you because..." which really gets on my nerves when that's not what it means.  History class was a nightmare the teacher couldn't get a word out anytime a \textbf{black} person in history did something wrong they had to defend them and when a white person did something wrong (like a lot of history) kids couldn't shut up about it all kids could do was just point blame. I think we all get it some white people in the past and present have sucked. One instance was when we watched the news in class and they said " this is the worst case of slavery in the world so far, greater numbers than ever before" that right there was apparently an argument. "No \textbf{black} people were slaves and we have had it worse than anyone" okay we get it you had it bad like you point out every damn day in this class but 45.8 million slaves just last year their pain isn't a competition. People may have it worse. Someone will always have it worse. It's not a competition. I heard small competitions and drama daily about stupid things like hundred dollar weave and nails. I don't even have five dollars to buy food. I save money for priorities but no I was a loser for saying I save money for college. What's worse is I heard constant talk about cheating and not the way it should be talked about. No. I heard congratulating for people cheating and "playing" multiple guys/girls(random bit of info: this school has the highest teen pregnancy rate in the county). This school was filled with people who cause these biases, no matter their color. I get it wasn't their skin colors fault that they were like that because anyone from the south st.pete area was like this but I've seen people leave this school completely hating \textbf{black} people because they had to deal with a bad bunch and that's not right either. Bias happens and when this is all you see for years it can get to you. I luckily found a good group and love my friends from that school, they are of all races and treat people well which is a very important thing to me. We were all the oddballs the ones who bullied. People that have had to deal with these kind of actions from anyone of any \textbf{race} it'd be obnoxious. It's not the color of people it's the actions of people and a school like that one makes people correlate the two even though correlation doesn't equal causation.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small This is hardly surprising. Even without wilful efforts by Republicans to sow racial dissent in America, \textbf{black} people are more likely to be poor, more likely to be criminal, and more likely to be out of work. None of these are values that white parents would want their kids to be surrounded by. By the same token, until \textbf{black} children discover the differences between their communities and white communities, of course they see white and \textbf{black} children as equal.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small 'You can't be \textbf{racist} because it's 2012' at the time of this video. Best quote from this, and the sign of hope for all humanity. No matter what racial \textbf{ethnicity} we are, skin color, facial features, hair texture, and all body functions are evolutionary traits that developed over time to adapt to the environments ancient people populated.Best example? Dark skin is the natural shield against sunburning, while lighter skin particularly in Europe came from the need to obtain vitamin D from the sun since diets were not providing enough vitamin D.That is my best understanding for why racial \textbf{ethnic} cities exist. Mother nature, and natural selection. Of course some societies established strict hierarchies while others were more communally organized around a middle class.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small It seems like they did not do the first part of the study correctly. There should have been a control group where the images were shown with two children of the same \textbf{race} on each image. Otherwise there is no way to say that the reason they are not considered friends is due to their differing races. When I saw the first image, I thought the child on the left was a bully to the child on the right and had pushed him to the floor, and thought the same thing when they showed the \textbf{race} reversal image. I believe I would have thought the same thing if they were two children of the same \textbf{race}. I was just interpreting the scene and their body language. In my opinion the most logical reason that the younger kids thought the kids in the pictures were friends and the older kids thought they weren't friends was simply because the older kids had developed to a point where they could pick up on subtleties in the image that younger kids wouldn't see. The fact that the kids weren't smiling or showing concern for one another, the standing kid wasn't offering to help the fallen kid, etc, are why I think older kids wouldn't believe the two children were friends. Younger kids wouldn't be as likely to pick up on those details and would just see two kids in the hall. You can't look at the findings shown in this video and rightfully conclude that the children are getting more \textbf{racist} as they get older, since you don't know from the study why people's perceptions of the images changed. Maybe the scientists who ran this study were biased and wanted to get certain results, which caused them to muddy the study.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small My son was told by a group of white boys who were all 7 years \textbf{old} that he could not play with them because he was \textbf{black}. This was at St. John Neumann Catholic Elementary School in Columbia, South Carolina. The boys where in the second grade and in the same class. Surprised, I mentioned the incident to the principal and she did speak to the parents of the child who made the statement.

We are not from the south or the east coast. Something like that would never have happened at my sons previous school, Mission Parish School, in San Juan Capistrano. At seven, the boy's comment didn't phase my son much but he never forgot it. He played by himself and I honestly believe he was fine.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small In my opinion it is how a person is raised. If the parents are uneducated, never traveled to other countries, or have no interest in experiencing other cultures, then their children will also be culturally ignorant. I am AfroAmerican and had the luck of having , Italian, Mexican, and straight up White kids as my friends. I sleep at their house and they at mine. We were together everyday. I was never called the ‚ÄòN' word, or had the feeling it was just a front. It wasn't until I started being interested in girls at around 10 or 11 that the \textbf{race} card came into play. After being raised in a family where \textbf{race} was not as important self respect and a positive character, I was surprised when Kim's father told me I couldn't date his daughter because I was \textbf{Black}. We played b-ball together, often ate at the same table, and went to the same Church, BUT, I was not White. I have a very multiracial family. My Sister, Nephews, Cousins, and I are all married to someone of another \textbf{race}. Being from Philly, the City of Brotherly Love, (Fly Eagles Fly) and living in the Burbs, I knew and felt as though the White Folks were not better then we were. And we were not inferior to anyone. \textbf{Race} will always be a disgrace to America. The White \textbf{Racist} talk about getting rid of the DACA applicators, and make America greater BS, but are ignorant to the fact the First \textbf{Nation} are the REAL Americans. Everyone else was either brought there, fled from persecution, or sought to spread there germs in another country. The Whites are actually European. \textbf{Race}, and violence are the foundations that The Whites used then, and are still using today. Just look at the 45. He has spoken the hate that many people feel, but were to ashamed to say, UNTIL NOW!! When you look deeper at Evolution or the origin of \textbf{race}, there are those, me included, who believe the human \textbf{race} started in Africa, and that because of people looking for another place to live, people wandered about, eventually as folks moved further away from the sun the lighter their skin was. Actually the only way an AfroAmerican person can ‚Äòturn' White is through a skin disorder, or skin bleaching. But a White person can change their skin complexion just by sitting in the sun or going to a tanning salon. In fact White people are \textbf{Black} with White skin!! I believe if we raise our children to respect themselves and others who don't look like them, we could be on the way to solving this problem. But I believe it is also the Parents responsibility to teach their children that there are those children that have not learned to respect themselves, therefore they have a problem with respecting anyone else.

Like I said, standing up against real \textbf{racism} is a good thing..  But being questioned about "what you're doing" to help based on your skin colour is not the way to go. Yes it's true that everything you do starts with you but that also applies to the person doing the judging, and judging or stereotyping others isn't the best starting point. If people want it to be a collective effort It should be a discussion on how do WE all stop this and move forward, not one group of people pointing their finger at another group of people (unless they are pointing the finger at actual racists in order to get them to change their mindset). When people do this it creates a defensive reaction which is not the way to collaborate for the greater good.

Systemic \textbf{racism} is white supremacy in action, we're not talking about what your ancestors did. They only laid the foundation, but whites today carefully tend it. Not all white people perpetuate the problem,  some actively challenge systemic \textbf{racism}. As the majority population in a country where those with the power to oppress others are overwhelmingly white and those who benefit are overwhelmingly white,  all white people here bear the burden and responsibility to challenge it. It's not up to people of color to eliminate systemic \textbf{racism}, as we're not the ones carrying it out. Only YOU,  white people, have the real power to dismantle the white supremacist system.

You could be the most \textbf{race} or color-blind person in the world and still benefit from a system of oppression. Just because you don't see \textbf{race} doesn't mean other people think the same. It's like saying "I don't see Jewish people as different. Let's get rid of anti-antisemitism. Let's not talk about it." whilst ignoring the fact that Jewish people went through genocide and are still discriminated against. It just doesn't make any sense. We can all wish \textbf{racism} away but that's not the reality. You think I like talking about \textbf{race}? You think I like people stereotyping me just because I'm Asian?

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Scientifically speaking there are more negatives associated with having whitish/yellowish skin. White skin is genetically disease ridden according to the NIH (which may be due to biological inheritance from the European \textbf{black} plague). White skin produces random moles, warts, liver spots, and exposure of vericose veins. White skin also produced by pheomelanin a sulfur based substance that is naturally smelly. Furthermore, having such skin makes you extremely sensitive to the sun... which is supposed to be a natural energy source to all living things. It is quite possible for white skin to burn from UV rays even if the temperature is below 70 degrees. Furthermore, having the hair of one who has white skin makes you prone to ticks, fleas, and lice larvae (as well as the newly evolved super lice). Being exposed to people with white skin is actually dangerous and makes one prone to over 6000 possible diseases (again, according to the NIH) hence the need for any country with whites to be given vaccinations. The negatives of having brown/dark brown skin is... purely social.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!27}1/177 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.565 \\  \hline

I would do that for family and friends. I've always been taught to protect whomever I'm with. Especially in a work environment and the diversity is non-existent. Of course I'm an adult and don't go looking for trouble and yes I can stand up for myself, but there are other situations where this comment rings very true.

Kids fight, when you're grown you don't have time for the BS, got bills to pay, responsibilities to tend to.   I'm  gonna teach my kids to stay away from shit like that(also to defend themselves if needed) If more people were aware of what they indirectly teach their children, we would have less children with bad attitudes trying to fight each other. You can't just group people together just because you had an issue with a white kid leaving you to get beat down, anyone any skin tone can do that.

When I was in elementary school, I had a \textbf{black} male friend, and kids being kids, would tease us, and say we are dating, and my dad lost his shit when he learned. He told me specifically I'm never to date a \textbf{black} man (he's since opened up to the idea, somewhat) but that, I thought was sorta, just wrong. But when I was in middle school, I had another \textbf{black} friend, who's parents didn't like the idea of him being around white people, at all. We were under the table friends, they didn't even know I existed. My parents didn't care, but he was scared to death his parents would find out, since, his sister had been disowned for marrying a white man. It's absolute lunacy.

What i cared about and noticed even at \textbf{age} 6, was how kids never shipped me with white kids. I even brought it up to my friends and even asked them something along the lines of "how come you guys never ship me with anyone other than (the two \textbf{black} kids)?" and they replied with something along the lines of "because you have a different skin color". Also in 5th grade i had a crush on this boy (he was white) and i didnt care that he was white. But one of my friends did. I told her i had a crush on him and she legit said to my face " i dont think you guys would work out". Now, i thought maybe he was \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} or maybe he had a girlfriend already but no- she said to me "its because he's white and youre-ya know-\textbf{black}." i was so shocked and upset that i just sorta sat there dumbfounded. Through all the years ive had lots of crushes (they were all white) and not once did their \textbf{race} ever effect how much i liked them. Why should it? I liked them because of their personality not because of their fucking skin color. Are you fucking kidding me?

For some of us, our nature is simply to be upstanding humans and try to set good examples. No one should have to be a spokesperson (for lack of a better word) for their \textbf{race} or \textbf{gender} if that is not something they are comfortable doing. It should not take \textbf{black} women having to speak out publicly to avoid being judged as a group instead of who they are individually and how they personally conduct themselves.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Gender, Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}5/124 & \cellcolor{green!5}4.032 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Tahisha Tolbert No one says - myself especially - that \textbf{Black} women cannot and should not be able to chose their own path and be themselves. But there are limits to individuality when it crosses the line of consequence.  And sadly there are far, far to many \textbf{black} women that have crossed that threshold. So much so it has denigrated the public reputation of good \textbf{black} women such as yourself. As \textbf{black} people we are not afforded context, as whites are.  If a \textbf{black} thug (male or female) shows up on the National news it's not just his/her fault (as to the crime he/she committed), but somehow it becomes a systemic issue with the "\textbf{Black} Community" at large. Somehow he/she was OUR responsibility; not that he/she should've been responsible for his/her own actions.  My concern is that \textbf{Black} women do not understand how much power they weild in this community, and thus society.  As \textbf{Black} women go, the whole \textbf{Black} community goes. These bigoted \textbf{old} white men running things knew this generations ago, so they tailored pitfalls like government assistance to \textbf{Black} women, not men.  But the bad \textbf{black} women are hijacking YOUR spot and are indirectly acting as the spokespeople for Blacks (especially \textbf{Black} women) with the horrendous behavior they exude in public.  Yeah, you can be your own individual self and pretend this issue doesnt impact you or your individuality.  But it does. Sadly, it does. White girls can stab other girls in the name of Slenderman all day....yet it won't move the needle as to how society at large views white girls. Why? Context. They have it, we don't.   I said it my initial post that I take no pleasure in calling \textbf{Black} women a scourge.  I mean that.  YOU have the power.

Her name was Patty and I told everyone. My uncle (my dad's twin) asked me if she was \textbf{black} or white. I couldn't tell him. It hadn't occurred to me to take notice. He thought I was lying. My father had to step in and remind him I had no reason to lie to him. And not everyone in our family was a bigot liked him. I didn't understand at the time, but I do now.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Well, I (white,m 23) had a classmate from sri lanka: plain dark Brown - not totally \textbf{black} (that's why they're \textbf{coloured} people). We learned flute together in School, but he had no Special teacher for that. We all had to Play the flute in the regular class during six years and what I know about him is, that he couldn't Play by the notes head, he always had to sort of translate them into the letters... I guess he was all the way self-conscious, because he's a foreigner. He was good in the maths (that's the only subject where the races start at the same level)... His whole family had very good disciplin and all was clean and they were tamil btw. We watched together yu-gi-oh and we played computer games. I never had the idea, that blacks would be inferior and I was playing together with him very innocently. It's my own right to be a \textbf{racist} or not, but I've no clue why I should be a \textbf{racist}, because they've psychologic issues and it's hard to find out how much worth they are.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Thomas A. Try to educate yourself at some point. There is a reason that poor neighborhoods in places like Detroit end up the way they do. If we stuck people that look like you in areas with no real opportunities for generation after generation and gave schools in your area the worst teachers and very little money for things like books, music, art, etc., taught society that you were lazy and ignorant in order that employers would be hesitant to hire you, drove unemployment up so high that people gave up hope, then flooded neighborhoods with drugs, so drugs offered the best opportunities to make money, you folks wouldn't be doing so well either. It's a miracle that anyone makes it out of those circumstances. So really, you aren't leaving blacks alone when the government contributes to the demise of those communities.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Racism is still alive and well today and the only way to work on it is to talk about it instead of always trying to push it under the rug.

Just a few years ago when I was in high school, high school kids shared similar views. And a lot of it was all in response to what their parents might think about interracial friendships relationships. Smh but we learn to hate.

I go to a predominantly white school including teachers as a person of colour, and when it comes to these types of topics they simply pass it off as "love everyone!", "we are the same!", respect this, respect that. It's never taught properly and this just enables more ignorance towards the whole situation. And the fact that I live in the U.K. whenever we do talk about these topics we just talk about slavery and immigration in America as if it covers everything about the history of the oppression of people of colour. People also tend to make it a \textbf{black} \& white thing forgetting about the tons of other people of colour who had valid roles in our history. People really need to take the education of our children seriously by choosing the right teachers who have their facts right.

I would say humanity is pretty similar for the most part although there are some people who have been forcibly wired to just hate. For example in 92 when the Orthodox Serbs genocided the Muslim Bosnians and Catholic Croats. Sure religion played a role, but it was more so \textbf{ethnicity}. Even though to the rest of the world all of those \textbf{ethnic} groups look exactly the same. More examples include the \textbf{ethnic} cleansing episodes that have happened in Africa between different \textbf{African} ethnicities or the Japanese feeling superior to other East Asians during WW2 to the point where they used Chinese for cruel medical experimentations like live vivisections without anesthesia. I think even if we all had the same skin colour hate can still be embedded into malleable minds.

And if you wanna say that then look at the statistics. Go ahead and find some stuff out. Like one thing that many people are beginning to know is that although blacks take up about twelve percent of the population they commit half of crimes here in America. That doesn't sound like a good thing. Also, a \textbf{black} police officer is more likely to kill a white person rather than a white officer is to kill a \textbf{black} person.

When I was younger, \textbf{black} kids would always make comments on my skin color. I never did the same though. These stereotypical remarks are what's separating us. The more people joke about this typical white person,  the more people of color will dislike them. The more people joke about \textbf{black} people, the more others will dislike them.

"So...? I think he looks neat, besides his name sounds cool/funny, Ba-rak O-ba-ma," I said as I pronounced every syllable carefully.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I don't know why this test is so confusing to everybody let your emotion go forget about your emotions and analyze everything they do here. Analyze the children and try to analyze everything they say. Put yourself in their shoes, and get personal memories from your experience of living your life and what has happened with the different types of people you see around you how do they get treated. The answer is really simple, why the children say and do what they do, (It's a reflection of self ever since you were born and your parents looked at you they always told you you were the best you're the most prettiest  you're perfect and you are special, but the people you believe in the people you trust and you know they would never do harm to you never say the same thing to another \textbf{race} and actually they say bad things about other races from a very young \textbf{age}? of course you're going to interpret other people other races to be bad, to steal, to be mean, to bully people. why it's simple because your parents never told you that other races, people are just like you, so if you don't know other races or people are just like you you're going to think they're different what does different usually mean well it can be interpreted in many ways specifically in bad ways if they aren't like you why? Because reflection of self. you were raised to be nice to the people around you, So what happened through the years that made you change ideas of people, it's simple your surroundings, meaning your family your mom and dad can change their ideas and beliefs as you get older and you get accustom to what they think and believe why because they're your parents and you look up to them for guidance, your friends, the entertainment you watch big effect on children kids don't go out to play as much anymore because of all the entertainment and and games that you have in your home in your house, TV, the ,Internet is another bad place if parents don't watch what their children are watching very big key why kids act the way they act, movies, even books, man even if you're able to read from a very young \textbf{age} 4 to 6 years and I don't know here's an EXAMPLE: You see a flyer or newspaper of a white man and a \textbf{black} man fighting from that very young \textbf{age} you can interpret that those two races don't like each other, subconsciously you're going to carry that with you the rest of your life without you really knowing why you think the way you think, when in all reality that newspaper or flyer you saw when you were four or six years \textbf{old}, and maybe you at that \textbf{age} maybe you couldn't read but you could see you had eyes to see images/picture of both men both different, You know what they say a picture can say a thousand words, When in all reality that newspaper or flyer you saw was a boxing match or a MMA fight for money not because they hated each other. They might even have been best friends those two men, they were just fighting to see who was the better fighter and of course for money. I hope you understand the point I tried to make there what I'm saying is children are very easy to influence, that's why from a very young \textbf{age} you have to be careful what you show them, what they can listen to and what you teach them, or else they're going to think different is bad, why because it's not like them, they can't see their own reflection they can't see themselves in the other person they don't look like them so that means they're not the same. And also they make so many of these episodes on television news because everything's a business and where a business is established it's going to try to make as much money as possible, sadly to say some companies don't care how they make their money as long as they make it, so that they can keep on making more episodes and more money,they are going to give you ideas why they think children discriminate each other and say the other is better than the other from a young \textbf{age}, hope it made sense I know it was a little bit long I didn't put all my thoughts and here either going to be way too long if i did.So I just made as short as possible.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Black, Old, Race & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}9/776 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.16 \\  \hline

It's a survival mechanism.Just like you're more trusting of family members than strangers. Prisons segregate by \textbf{race}. Everywhere you look humans naturally segregate by \textbf{race}. Even when America was 99 white it segregated by different white nationalities. Most people exclusively date and marry someone who share the same skin tone or \textbf{nationality}. Coincidence?People need to get over their obsession with \textbf{race} and this propaganda that diversity is a strength because it's clearly not. It's just one more thing for people to not trust each other over and fight about. Take the \textbf{black} community for example, they're so damn paranoid that this thing called white privilege exists, it makes them not trust a group of people based entirely on the color of their skin. How the fuck is that a strength for anyone? It's divisive, and it's never going to change. People are always going to look over their shoulder. Would \textbf{black} people feel more comfortable if white people suddenly disappeared or went away? Rest my case.Do you know where racial tension doesn't exist? In places where there's only one \textbf{race}. There's not a single place on earth that doesn't have racial tension if there's more than one \textbf{race} that's forced to live among each other. It's not just white people. Their are tribes in Africa that can't stand each other despite having the same skin color.Do you think white people are discriminated against in non white countries, or do you think that white privilege goes with them everywhere? Is it ok for white people to be discriminated against in non white countries? How's that white privilege going to work out for them in Somalia? It's called majority privilege. Everywhere there's a majority a \textbf{race}, that \textbf{race} will automatically have a privilege. Japan has Asian privilege. Saudi Arabia has muslim privilege. If you're not Asian or muslim, life is going to be less accommodating for you in these places, as it should be. Why should a group of people setup it's country based on another group of peoples customs and culture? That makes no sense. Like it or not, America was setup and built by white people, so it was setup how white people prefer to do things. That's not \textbf{racist}, that makes sense.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small A Highly Complex Question but, in part, some of the origins of \textbf{racism} can be traced back to the height of the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade...Basically, some Europeans were starting to get cold feet about the whole venture... Given the sheer amount of human suffering involved, in shipping and treating people like cattle.So pseudo-scientific attempts were made to justify this treatment. If European intellectuals could 'prove' that Africans weren't really human and were in fact 'sub-human' then treating them like cattle COULD be justified and so the trade could continue without any recourse to niggling issues... Like guilt or doubt...And thus an entirely new ideology was born, which lives with us to this Very Day... An ideology whose original purpose, was to simply make slavery more 'palatable'.And as with ALL ideologies... In spite of new information and better ways of thinking, ideologies tend to stick around...

After the 10 and 30 of people you have people who are just consumers they just constantly consume things you might as well call them worthless mouths to feed that don't add anything to but practically destroy the planet but the funny thing is the planet isn't something that could be easily fucked up completely by the human \textbf{race} the planet can do a polar shift and shake us off like fleas. And since we're consuming so much the Malthus prophecy has to come true which is what environmentalists are trying to avoid. Malthus prophecy is if we keep rapidly growing in numbers and continue to consume at an alarming rate we will get wiped out either by disease famine War or natural causes it doesn't matter what really kills us but it will eventually if we keep up with our stupidity and not caring what decisions we make we will end up like the Easter Islands. And yes there are some fantastic humans that made some fantastic things but majority of humans go down a harder route not a realistic route not even a pessimistic route but a route of being a Savage all consuming Beast that harms others and takes advantage of others and is uncaring. Rather than being an enlightened sentient critical thinking being capable of doing the impossible. Lastly the thing I really don't like about this day and \textbf{age} especially in America is this Cult of "being optimistic" and at the same time being a dumbass unaware of things and thinking they know everything also known as arrogance and people who don't know what they don't know and act as though they do know also known as ignorance. I'm a realist so I see things as they are as an observer watching the shitshow but even still I see the pros and cons and weigh them against each other of different mindsets. For example people demonize pessimism but pessimism is necessary to find the flaws in the system and correct them well an opportunistic person grabs an opportunity by the balls at that very moment a realistic person can observe a situation without taking sides pretty much neutral it's all about facts and what it is they are observing while an optimist can find the best in the worst which is why a lot of con men tend to use optimism to trick their customers. optimism is best used when there is little to \textbf{nothing} to be grateful for when you are Optimist you're grateful for anything and everything. Pessimism would not Thrive when there's \textbf{nothing} to really be grateful for. Optimism would not Thrive when fixing a system because optimism would not know what to look for or see what is wrong and why it is wrong or malfunctioning a realist would not thrive in a cult-like society that wants your opinions on everything. the opportunistic person would not thrive in a place with no opportunity or they would not Thrive if they get too impulsive and make an unwise decision\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Nothing, Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}4/555 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.721 \\  \hline

Some of us realize this, but those people tend to be laughed at and accused of overreacting, and they're not even listened to whenever disaster strikes. Droughts are causing wars over basic resources, forest fires are destroying homes, hurricanes are flooding cities, and entire species are going extinct like never before in human history. And yet millions of people are claiming that \textbf{nothing} is wrong, and that the issue is just the imaginary product of a conspiracy. We even get hostile towards each other based on where we stand in this particular debate.Your channel was named after a man who doesn't even understand the difference between climate and weather because he's too busy worrying about what the media is saying about him, and yet that same man is now one of the most powerful people in the world thanks to democracy.

I don't know if that's true, but it definitely makes us the most dangerous.Sure, we've turned huts into skyscrapers and cave paintings into computers. We've also turned ideas into \textbf{terrorist} organizations and spears into missiles. We've stored so much information on the internet that most people are now far less motivated to actually learn anything for themselves. And even though we've had countless centuries to figure out how fundamentally similar we really are, we still haven't managed to eliminate \textbf{ethnicity} as a major factor in our society.We still haven't figured out that not liking cultural change isn't a good enough excuse to try to cut ourselves off from the rest of the world. Even if our civilization survives, it will probably pervert itself into some sort of corrupt and abusive dystopia like \textbf{Nazi} Germany or North Korea. But we're too blinded by our fear and hatred of people who look or act or dress or pray or speak or think different from us. We're too proud of ourselves to admit our own hypocrisies. Even I struggle to rise above this madness. It's as terrible as it is nonsensical.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small +Frederick Goodwill, I believe that \textbf{racism} is a social construction learned over time. Put toddlers of all races together with toys etc, chances are none of them see colour/race - they  don't even know what colour is. Instead, they are more interested in interacting with one another. With time, things change. They learn from their parents on how they interact with other races - directly or indirectly. Once \textbf{racism} kicks in, it's really difficult to change it. It becomes automatic.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Racism & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/80 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.5 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small That is not what the study on infants and toddlers discovered. They weren't picking a particular \textbf{race}, which technically isn't even scientific and has no science basis behind it, the babies were going to what's familiar. If a caucasian baby is born to a caucasian family then yes they will play with other toddlers but when seeking comfort they will gravitate to those that are also white because it's what they know. But if an Asian baby is born or adopted to a white family, guess what they will gravitate to other white babies, or if they are born to a \textbf{black} family, same thing. They know \textbf{nothing} of \textbf{race} they know familiarity.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@M Kay Regarding babys are not \textbf{racist}, I've seen studies supporting both sides, that's why I take a neutral stance on that one.What I do know is that it depends in forms of:If a kid has interaction with babys of all kinds of heritages (I reject the term races, see my above statement why) they "know" of this and act without ill manners.If a kid grows up in a singular community where all have more or less the same heritage and is then suddenly confronted with children that differ from what is "known", it will most likely flock back to the accustomed.This is per se not \textbf{racism}, it's a simple thing of comfort zone derived from the known vs the unknown.\textbf{Racism} is learned and starts at this very \textbf{age} - please excuse me to use skincolors to make direct examples.A white baby is playing nicely in the sandbox and a \textbf{black} mother puts her baby in there as well - absolutely harmless situation and in the worst two extremes the white baby will either ignore the \textbf{black} baby or be curious since it by all means looks different from what it knows.Now if the white mother comes rushing in and makes a scene even at that young \textbf{age} the white baby will make conclusions in the terms of "this must be bad". We still haven't a \textbf{racist} and if the parents aren't overly \textbf{racist} it will stay at that and it can be corrected via experiences in later years. But if the parents are in fact \textbf{racist} chances are high, the kid will grow up being a \textbf{racist}.It's much like religion - a kid will most likely adopt the religion of it's parents and only in rare cases takes a totally different one or even become atheist.More lengthy comment than anticipated.

Regarding kids who flock back to what they are used to when being confronted with what they are not (kids of other races), then I think parents should step in and inform their child about them ,not being biased either, and allow the child to make a choice of interacting with  them in the future or not. If they don't, it doesn't make them \textbf{racist} but they'll know there's \textbf{nothing} wrong with interacting them.With \textbf{racist} parents, the cycle continues.

People fail to look at things scientifically and objectively.Everywhere white people go there are VIOLENCE and \textbf{RACISM}-S.Africa, America, Australia,New ZEALAND etc. Now what is \textbf{racism}.\textbf{Racism} is a symptom of PSYCHOSIS that is PSYCHOTAHIC or SOCIOPATHIC behavior. \textbf{Racism} is looking for an excuse to harm another person, whether it is \textbf{RACE}, CULTURE, NATIONAL ORIGIN, LANGUAGE- that is the reason for Europes endless/countless bloody wars- and things stupid \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} neck feuds like the Hatfields and the McCoysLike I said a psychopath needs a victim, preferably someone that stands out for whatever reason. ONLY 10 OF THE WHITE POPULATION ARE NOT \textbf{RACIST}.Everyone else is a degenerate thief liar and murderer. 35 million Indians(Asian), 100 million Indians(American), millions of Chinese (OPIUM wars), 10 million Congolese, millions of Africans under colonial rule, apartheid, Slavery in the USA that killed about 50million Africans on their way to the states, Then Lynchings, \textbf{Jim c\textbf{row}} etc etc etc. You have to wait for those white children to come off \textbf{age} they will be \textbf{racist} as hell.Thier ability to think for themselves and their PLEASURE functions/pathways have not developed yet.\textbf{Racism} for white people is about PSYCHOTIC pleasure, it is about making people suffer, for their amusement(almost like some-coliseum).Another thing that follows PSYCHOTIC white people around is CULTS.White people are obsessed with CULTS, because cults enable them to act out their psychosis. Freemasonry, Mormonism, Judaism, Thelema, Rosicrucianism  and every other ungodly cult produced in Europe and the USA by the hundreds if not thousands. It is one thing to be stupid or low IQ(as white people claim others are) at least then you have the excuse of stupidity, that is a stupid person doesn't really know what their doing, they don't grasp the consequences of their actions on others and even themselves, hence why you see when stupid people commit crimes its usually in the spur of the moment, very limited in range(victims) and they always very much get caught(they had no intention to plan).But then we have JACK THE RIPPER-who until today no one has caught- countless crimes against humanity that whites make sure their kids don't know about by scrubbing the history books(SEE SASHI THAROOR)-that shows intent and even worse a LACK OF REMORSE.(SOCIOPATHY).

The Ottoman Empire was responsible for slavery too.  To hide the fact that Russians were stolen from their land and were slaves for Arabs, is wrong and is also in history books. Polish were slaves and Irish were slaves.  Persians kept slaves and were going to Europe to find more women to kidnap and make as their brides.  Whites were slaves to the Muslim world for centuries.  In conclusion all people of Earth were slaves for someone during a particular time period.  It was wrong on all sides.  Lets STOP using an \textbf{old} blame game, get back to work and think before allowing these political motivated racial movements to take over our hearts and minds.  They only want us divided and fighting to cloud our minds and focus.  That way while we are busy arguing among ourselves , in the background they are deciding all our fates behind closed doors and contemplate something even more sinister.

Many linguists say languages that come to America unfortunately come here and die, which is incredibly sad! Considering we have the most diverse population and we are advancing faster into a global economy, now would be the time to embrace people from all cultures and learn from them instead of trying to change them. That's what's wrong with America today. This idea that everyone must speak English is asinine and despite the fact that other industrialized nations provide education for their adolescents, learning multiple languages as young as 3 years \textbf{old}, encouraging immigrants to embrace their cultures instead of pushing such frigid assimilation, and yet many people here refuse to even bother to learn another language.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small the minecraft \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} panda ! Nice try. Your a bit off base though.The term "African-American", was coined as a racial disruptor, for blacks in America.For the longest time, they were identified racially as "\textbf{Negro}". Then they were often refered to as simply "\textbf{colored}" people. That led to "Afro-American". But someone was allways finding something about each term, to be offended over. As the P.C. era was rushed in. And 'multi-cuturalism' replaced assimilation. Some liberals, began latching onto, describing themselves, and others as hyphenated Americans. Like 'German-American', or 'Italian-American'. Since the overwhelming majority of blacks, have no clue of their \textbf{nation} of origin. The left adapted the continent, And began referring to all blacks in America, as "African-Americans" as their official Politically Correct, racial disruptor, without deference to where their ancestors hailed from.I get a huge laugh out of a friend of mine. His family immigrated from the \textbf{nation} of 'South Africa'. So he will describe himself as an 'African-American', on government documents.

However, not all 'dark brown skin' individuals or individuals that has so called \textbf{African} physical characteristics, who may or may not identify as \textbf{Black}, are \textbf{African} natives. The Native Australians (Aborigines) are an example of this. The question here is why do we often hear \textbf{Black} people in America referred to as \textbf{African}-American?

I always made my own decision on who I allowed to be my friend based on their character and how they treated me. Interestingly enough, I was also never told by my parents how to practice safe \textbf{sex} or "don't do drugs."

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Let me tell You from my experience what i think is the reason. In the country where I was born there are no \textbf{black} people at all (2 \textbf{black} foreigners in my town and that's the only ones I've seen back there except for a group of tourists from America) and so people don't have the need to address \textbf{black} people face to face and they don't get a personal experience with different 'races'. When speaking about \textbf{black} people from other European places (like Germany or UK fore example) they still frequently use the term '\textbf{African} American' (!) because that's what they think is polite and apparently most people here think every \textbf{black} person must be \textbf{African} (which is not true) but just saying they're \textbf{African} sounds offensive to some of Europeans for some reason. I don't know why, I think they just still have this broken image of poor Africa. Also just calling them '\textbf{black}' is by many Europeans considered offensive and \textbf{racist} simply because 'racism towards \textbf{black} people' seems to be the default state of mind, at least in the country where I grew up, and sadly most people don't break out of this 'default' approach. So they call \textbf{black} people '\textbf{African} American' when they try to sound polite even if at the end of the day it makes them sound ignorant because the people aren't even \textbf{African} OR American. But that's the only way they learned to call them not to sound \textbf{racist}.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African, Black, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}12/246 & \cellcolor{green!5}4.878 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Dante, I hope you can understand what Tony is saying.  And it's not because the word was "\textbf{black}".  It used to be "\textbf{negro}" and that has a negative connotation to it, which is why after \textbf{Jim C\textbf{row}} was repealed the word became "\textbf{African} American" (you know since they need to be labeled as a singular foreign group)..."\textbf{Black}" is a broad term and cannot be synonymous with "\textbf{African} American," there are many other ethnicities and cultures derived of "\textbf{black}" people...I'm actually surprised no one has said "ebony" yet.   It's like saying "Asian" features are synonymous with Japanese or Korean....or "\textbf{y\textbf{e\textbf{llow}}}".  Sounds kind of  ignorant/racist doesn't it.You know what else is \textbf{black}?  Oil (cha ching).  But honestly that whole thing about people being offended of being called \textbf{black} is BS, although "blacks" technically aren't even the color \textbf{black}...maybe it was meant to be derogatory hmmmmm.  I don't know anymore lol...Maybe that term was used to be a perfect contrast of "white" (or the fantasy of being superior).  If "white" is "superior" then the natural antonym word "inferior," is "\textbf{black}" and it stuck to help lift the spirits of those who needed to boost their egos with that contrast...or maybe people are just color \textbf{blind} and can't tell the difference between the actual color \textbf{black} and varying shades of brown.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small m a y o n n a i s e I don't think it's harmful, but if you're a person with asian descent born in America, you're an American. A person with \textbf{african} descent born in America, is an American. No one goes around calling people with European descent  "European American", just American. Also, adding a continent in front of a country like that makes people sound not only foreign, but also alienated. There is no country called Asia or Africa. Most Americans that descend from slaves don't know where their people are from. So the term \textbf{African}-American sounds like someone's saying they don't belong here-nor-there.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}African & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!27}1/106 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.943 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small +m a y o n n a i s e Again, I agree, it's not harmful, but to say it doesn't mean anything isn't quite true.I say it makes one feel isolated because you don't belong here-nor-there when you say \textbf{African}/Asian American. Like I said, there is no country called Africa or Asia. You can't be connected to a whole continet. People with asian descent can go even furthur in and say where their family is from exactly (China/Korea/Taiwan), I imagine most Americans with asian descent do go furthur (from my experience I hardly ever hear someone just say "I'm asian" and not hear them clarify the where). People with slave descent can't do that. As far as my knowledge on Africa goes, the \textbf{African} countries today weren't there back when slaves were being taken. Mostly, there were many different states within an area. When Europeans came and messed that up, a lot of these states and tribes were just lost to history. I say that to say, people with \textbf{african} descent can't just go around connecting themselves to modern day Africa when their ancestors were never there to establish some connection. All their connections had been severed. So you question if you can really call yourself \textbf{African}. On the other end some Americans don't accept you because you're not viewed as "fully American"-- you're American, but not quite. I find this evident when people shout "Go back to Africa!" to people who've never been to Africa, and the only connection they've shared is the part where their ancestors were dragged out of said area.Or when people compare americans from slave descents to immigrants. Or when people think of Americans, they think white and never darker groups of people. I feel like these labels are more complicated than what they seem (and they should, because these are labels we're putting on real people, who are complicated).

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small +Nicholas Meagher With skin color and sun light you are right, but you are scratching at the surface.Someone born to parents from different ethnicities would be genetically superior to someone born to parents of the same \textbf{ethnicity}. The reason is because they would tend to get all the dominant genes from both cultures. Dominant genes are usually dominant because they are more useful than their recessive versions. So in essence your body would pick and choose the best genes, usually. Lighter skin, a recessive trait, would be more useful in darker environments like Scandinavia, Siberia and England because lighter skin allows the body to absorb more sunlight in order to create vitamin D. It is important for reproductive purposes and mindset.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/122 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.82 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small +Nicholas Meagher No fool listen up to Darwinian evolutionary theory.The dominant genes would be passed on: recessive genes that cause damage would not be passed on unless both parents have that recessive trait at which point there is a chance that it would be passed on. Though between parents of different ethnicities it would be very unlikely for any recessive genes to be passed on.That means a half \& half, Oreo looking son of a bitch, would be unlikely to suffer from either the \textbf{mental} illness of his Caucasian parent or the heart disease of his \textbf{African} parent. That is why intermixing is beneficial (it is a natural eugenic system).And don't label me a P.C nut because I haven't even called you a \textbf{racist}.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small +XxkanerulesxX Why is everyone saying I'm a Liberal even though I already said I am an independent?Also, do you actually think that single mothers are glad to be using food stamps and working two jobs to support themselves and their kids? Is it fair for fathers to simply abandon their children whenever they feel like it? How the hell was life better when they could just abandon their family?That's B.S. I'm pretty sure nearly all single mothers would prefer to have a husband that works. Yes, I know there are a lot of women that have decent jobs this day in \textbf{age}, but it's hard to be a mom and head of the household. At least if you want any type of economic prosperity.She could ignore her children or work herself to death to be there for them and their job. Still, it sucks. Even with alimony her ex might be a \textbf{bum} or a dead beat thug. You are assuming that her ex is a decent person with a stable job. That is not always the case.Also, I never said or implied that Republicans are \textbf{racist}. Though, it is a fact that the Republican party appeals to more xenophobic people.You might say, "Wasn't Lincoln a Republican though?", yes he was.  Though you have to understand that when FDR ran for President the first time he campaigned for the urban poor, and the minority classes (many of whom were first and second generation immigrants). This alienated xenophobic people in areas where their had already been several generations of immigrants, such that they did not identify with the culture if their progenitors. Long story short (still a long ass story), rural people (who had been Democrats since the beginning) became Dixiecrats. They were people who disliked Democratic social policy, but enjoyed the economic policies of the Democratic party (jobs programs, Social Security and federally funded power grids and power plants). Anyways, the first large breaks between the Dixiecrats and Democrats occurred during JFK's term. Many protestants disliked his Catholic background and even more disliked his progressive civil rights politics. The final break occurred during the religious revival in the South when it became known as the Bible belt. This was a Republican strategy to recapture low income voters by leaving their traditional urban poor demographic to the rural demographic that had been traditionally Democrat because by that point the urban poor were staunchly Democrat and the rural population was disenfranchised with the progressiveness of the Democrats.Now the action short story; the Republicans and Democrats switched their low class voter populations, and so the Democrats appealed mostly to the urban who were more likely to be immigrants, while Republicans appealed more to rural people who were less likely to be first or second generation immigrants.So yes, the modern Republican party does appeal more to xenophobic people. Now the entire party cannot be labeled as \textbf{racist} because political parties are not all about social views. Many voters sympathize with the economic views of the Republican party and don't care at all about social views. So while \textbf{racism} occurs in both parties it is far more likely to come from the right which aligns itself with traditional views that are in opposition to the cultures of non white people. Though, there is also opposition to non protestant or (by the Bible belt era) non traditional-Catholic views. Which would make them prejudice, but not \textbf{racist}. Still that's only the views of a,minority in the Republican party, and I'm certain that the majority don't give a crap about being prejudice, and just want to pay less taxes.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Bum, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Ethnicity - General, Social Class - Destitute & \cellcolor{green!27}6/608 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.987 \\  \hline

Because media has become more open to minorities and women it shouldn't come as a shock that their are values different than the Anglo values that held the country until the 60's. Conservative and liberal values are given similar air time in the media, but because conservatives are normally suspicious of mass media (since it does appeal to the masses) ever since the 60's usually people lean towards liberal views.Conservatism is simply a cultural way of gradually allowing progressive views. By the way, being a gentleman is still valued by both sides of the fence except for the extreme left (feminists and communists) and the fascists and anarchists of the extreme right.Honestly I think the majority of people in the U.S are moderates and don't have that much against each other, but then there are those 20 of the population (half being hardcore liberals and the other hardcore conservatives) that are fighting eachother at the nation's expense.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nobody & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!27}1/226 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.442 \\  \hline

Japan is a much less resource rich \textbf{nation} then China. Therefore Japan progressed more sophisticated technology, faster than China. And continues to do so.Another issue was domesticated animals. Animals were domesticated quickest in Asia and the middle east. From there they spread mostly to Europe because of a lack of large predators. Africa had large predators that made it difficult to domesticate animals there. The only animal that could actually be domesticated for work in the Americas was the llama. Domesticated animals even helped less intellectual people like the Mongols overtake more advanced empires (The Mongol Empire).The domestication of animals was important because it allowed their to be a food surplus which left more people free to pursue intellectual pursuits. And the reason that White people do better economically than \textbf{Black} Africans in Africa is because White Africans came from more intellectually prosperous regions of the world. The aforementioned regions being historically more intellectual for the reasons listed above.There just isn't as much of a biological distinction IQ wise between human races.The difference between female and male reaction speed is almost certainly more obtuse than any racial difference in IQ.

Most white people would be more nervous walking by a \textbf{black} man in a semi secluded area as opposed to a white man, even if they're dressed the same. Even if we don't react to the situations, we still feel it and think it. It happens with \textbf{ethnicity}, weight, \textbf{sex}, \textbf{gender} expression, \textbf{age}, clothing style, and everything else. So if we all stop pretending we don't have these prejudices, and we start talking openly with one another, we can fix this problem that so many people before us (and people now aka Trump) have created (or are trying to create).\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Black, Ethnicity, Gender, Racist, Sex & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}7/178 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.933 \\  \hline

There are such things as a \textbf{black} \textbf{racist}, an Asian \textbf{racist}, a middle eastern \textbf{racist}, and yes, a white \textbf{racist} and so on and so forth. \textbf{Racism} is not exclusive to any one \textbf{race}, and there is no such thing as reverse \textbf{racism} either.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The whole thing about \textbf{race} changes when the kids become adolescents ¬†because of the potential of interracial dating.

Whether it's \textbf{black}, brown, \textbf{y\textbf{e\textbf{llow}}}, \textbf{r\textbf{ed}}, or white, it doesn't matter because we're all humans. Why do blacks, yellows, browns and reds have to be treated differently? Why can't they all just be on the same level as whites? Because they can't. There's really no other reason, except for the fact that it's been like that for centuries. These innocent people who don't have the same skin colour as the whites get treated unfairly just because of their skin colour. Why can't people just be intelligent and be friends with them for who they are, inside? If people just keep being like this for the next couple of millenniums, I really see no hope for the human \textbf{race}. We need browns, blacks, yellows and reds to help us on our mission to create a better world. If we didn't have them, the world would just be plain boring. There would be no variety. Okay, I think I get it. Whites think they're superior because if their skin colour. Like seriously? Is that even a proper reason? No! Of course not. It's bias. Because not everyone thinks that having a skin colour like whites do means they're superior. It's like saying that \textbf{y\textbf{e\textbf{llow}}} people think they're better because their food is better, \textbf{black} people think they're better because their decorations are better, brown people think they're better because their festivals are better, and \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} people think they're better because their culture is better. Really!It happens all the time in countries like Australia and America (I know there are lots of other countries, but I won't mention them all because it would take too long and my fingers would be sore). When yellows, blacks, browns, and reds do something the whites don't like, some of them just get so rude and say, "Go back to your own country!" Well guess what? This isn't your country either! It's the Aborigines' and the \textbf{R\textbf{ed}} Indians'! If Christopher Columbous hadn't discovered America you wouldn't be here! It doesn't belong to you! This isn't your land!

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Sierra Callwood¬† "People identify differently across scale."And I suggest people analyze how they identify, doing so based on relevant attributes, and location or phenotype are rarely any of them.¬†"If an American were to ask another American where they're from, the person would probably name their native state"Usually one would ask such a question just as filler to be asking anything. Kinda like asking what someone's favorite food is, just for the fun of asking, and to learn secondary information about someone. Not to ascertain any meaningfulness or relevant information about someone. Someone's preference in food doesn't say anything indicative about them."Ask me where I'm from, and I know we both live in Florida, I'd say "Miami"."The same issues applies, but the context of the question(both knowingly being from Florida) implies a more specific question. But if the specific location of your residence or birth is irrelevant to the subject at hand, dividing yourself based on location is just divisive. Do you really think that being from a different city within Florida, a different state within the US, or even a different country on Earth, accurately indicates a difference in a meaningful way? No culture or location is entirely homogeneous. Observing a generality about a country/state/city isn't applicable to all individuals within it. The same goes for phenotypes("races")."That same scale could apply across a time."And the same error would be applied. If someone's ancestors were in a specific location 50 generations ago, that's not saying anything about them as an individual that couldn't be said about you if you had ancestors in the same location 10 generations ago. Asserting otherwise suggests that you are either asserting an inference between genetics and behavior, or that you are asserting that a culture(pass down activities/information) is homogeneous. Both of which are inaccurate. The mere fact that I am conversing with you here shows that our influences/information(cultures) are not separate."you see while we can ALL link back to Africa you can guess my ancestors stayed there a large amount of time long than yours"Really? What within this conversation indicates that to you? And just looking at your personal melanin levels doesn't indicate where the majority of your genes came from, whether you have high melanin levels or low. Someone with low melanin levels("white") can have more genes recently derived from Africa that another individual with high melanin. Genetics isn't as intuitive as you seem to be suggesting."while you may be able to trace your ancestry many generations, many African-Americans can not. So Africa becomes that ancestry."I don't see why such a tracing would be relevant in any way, to my life or my interactions with anyone. The issue is when you assert divisions between yourself and others. Whether my recent ancesters are from New \textbf{Guinea}, England, China, etc how would that difference change who I really am? Location of birth or ancestors doesn't determine behavior or activities. I'm eclectic in my activities and preferences. I look at the activities of all people and information available to me and appreciate them based on their merits, not based on where they happen to derive from. I don't identify based on any location, and when it comes to considering the activities of the locations I reside, or those of my ancestors, I consciously counter self-serving nationalistic biases.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Guinea & \cellcolor{green!27}Nationality - Italian & \cellcolor{green!27}1/560 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.179 \\  \hline
