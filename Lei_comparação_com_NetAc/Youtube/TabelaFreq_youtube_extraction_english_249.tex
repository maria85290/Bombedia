The slave should receive no quarter and real men should take pride in brutalizing the slave because the weak are not worthy to live."Consider the words of Ragnar Readbeard when you see the KKKops commiting acts of random violence against \textbf{black} people.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Dude.... If the cameras were not there that shit would had gone so different! That's the shit cops don't get, is that them just asking people questions about other people can fuck up some ones reputation. How many landlords are going to rent to some one that the cops pull a raid on? Even if the cops find \textbf{nothing}, which can often be the case, the cops have still fucked off that persons name and reputation in the community. What I don't get is why are they called "\textbf{black} identity extremists?" Is it because the group themselves are identifying as \textbf{black} survivalists, or is that the FBI's deal. Cause this group is not doing anything that every other Oath Keeper or militia group is doing, other than getting jammed up by the cops for practicing their First Amendment rights. If cops are worried about people talking shit about them on-line, then maybe they should be nicer, less over intrusive assholes, and respect peoples rights. Maybe just be normal. If you're having a hard time finding some one is a big time criminal, just admit you're wrong and leave them alone. As opposed to planting evidence, twisting facts to fit your narrative about an individual as opposed to how they actually live their life, and stop viewing the communities and people you're supposed to protect and serve like they are enemy combatants and you the occupying forces! Watch... Now cops will all start watching me for commenting here..... Like I'd be that lucky. Lol. What's the going rate on a false arrest or harassment suit these days?

No cop should be against this unless they have something to hide, which is the same reasoning they use against citizens for unlawful searches.And as far as what to do about these folks shooting Up public events and sending pipe bombs and things of that nature, how about listening when someone says they plan on causing harm 1st either in person or on social media.... and how about actually investigating these folks who clearly show an extreme and violent mentality towards people who don't look like them.These are all good places to start\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!27}3/233 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.288 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Aviyah Israel Never start a debate with an ad-hominem, 1. 2, You are referencing actions from the past which is narrow minded in the way of facts. The fact is, it was Africans/Arabs/Jews who sold slaves to the world. If those slaves weren't sold, the \textbf{African} tribes who conquered your ancestors tribes would have killed your ancestors right there. So your lives were saved by slavery, and yes that's a fact. Again, your ancestry were the weaker tribe who got conquered by their \textbf{african}/arab counterparts. 3, just look at the interracial murders over the past 30 years. Blacks have killed far more Whites than Whites have killed Blacks. So by your logic, we should hold \textbf{nothing} but hatred towards Blacks. By your words Whites should say, "the hell with Blacks"... So, do watch your double standards when you work these things out in your head. 5, stop with the "isrealites" bullshit. \textbf{Nobody} cares who is the true decedents of what. Most people today are so mixed that it's impossible to claim any type of birthright. 6, You are using religion for vengeful purposes, which isn't valid and only leads to war. A war btw in which you would lose in a heartbeat. 7, White hatred by Blacks are all too \textbf{common}, so if you try and take the high road, you are immediately brought down by the standard of "2 wrongs don;t make a right". Racial hatred is far more prevalent by Blacks since there are far more \textbf{Black} separatists groups. If you factor in the population percentages, it's a huge discrepancy. 8, Yes, yes you are killing Whites. Blacks kill Whites at a far higher rate than the reverse. The statistics prove that without any doubt. That makes your whole argument laughable... 9 I never said to love anyone. I am merely saying that you should apply \textbf{common} sense when constructing your feelings towards Whites. Given all of the facts I have laid out, your hatred isn't valid. And, by your logic, Whites would be justified in hating Blacks. Are you sure that is something you want? I don;t think you do. You underestimate the Benefit White culture has had on Blacks. Your wealth, life expectancy and other things have all greatly improved over your \textbf{African} counterparts because of White culture.  And lastly, you say "stay away from us? This is our country! We built it! We designed it! It's a product of White culture! If you want Whites to leave you alone, I suggest moving back to Africa!In conclusion, you are irrational when you live in the past and ignore the present. By your logic, Whites have much more of a problem with Blacks due to the standards you put forth. You kill us at a higher rate, and when you factor in population percentage, the problem is astronomical. My suggestion to you is stop using skin color as an identity, and start viewing people based on the concept of individuality. If you do so, you will be at peace and have a much better chance at happiness \& success. I am not defined by the wrong some people have done in the past who share an immutable characteristic such as skin color. I am to be defined by my individual character, which is put forward by the choices I make and actions I do. I would advise you to learn what personal responsibility means and drop the \textbf{Black} identity.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Let me start by saying I myself would love to have that brother as my neighbor I'm not feeling through all that man consists of is doing anything in anyway unjust to himself or others or trying to assemble some negative or unhealthy decision making examples , man look that man is up front about his doings he's not in fear nor hiding or should he be  . That man I would love as my neighbor we would get along fine I myself feel he deserves much respect you can feel that man would do the right thing in a can do wrong situations I would trust him with my kids . I can't say that I think of much of anyone but I can tell that man is from good people please praise that man for standing up for where he feels the need is necessary I'm really hoping he will be supported and see the good in what he stands up for I see the people who have been in his places of learning gaining the right, to also do the right thing in and or where there is a wrong situation and he served his country like I heard someone put it it was ok he put a gun in his hands leave his family go and serve out of his own family's business and it was OK but now he's a maybe a bad man with a gun . that is surly some misspent misplaced hogwash he deserves respect his actions in all he's showing and known for is proof and I hope he has the right  defense help he needs to get through the shit the trying to bury him in. It outright upsets me to think about things the way it's been and some ways is and probably gonna be I'm 52 yrs \textbf{old} but let me say I can assure you that man is worthy of much respect and support all people of all ethnicities can agree on that it's really to bad for who may be confused when and where they shouldn't be , can't get much of anything together living like that well ima get back to what I'm doing. I would not mind if I could hear this man is treated right and fair he's a good and positive person I hope not to hear something or somebodies does him or his love ones wrong or on some trumped up assumptions I will  be enough upset . Leave that man and what he's doing to be his business he feels fit to do he's not no radical he looks to care about himself feeding himself healthy to make healthy choices and stand up about it with \textbf{nothing} to hide MUCH LOVE AND RESPECT FROM THIS WAY BRO I WOULD LOVE YOU AS MY NEIGHBOR .AGAIN I SAY PLEASE LEAVE THAT MAN AND WHAT HES DOING OUT YOUR MESS.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small There will never be ‚Äòtotal equality' regarded across the board and the notion of that ever existing is simply a fallacy.

That, or either feeling pressured to maintain a conscious bias against their OWN \textbf{race} so as to avoid being considered 'partial or raciest.' This is just a fact that needs to be accepted. The question is how to Properly address the issue.

How they emasculate or debilitating the blacks is not through the sword or honor as the popularized western adaptation of chattel slavery, is by via the pen and paper and along with allot of dishonesty and bigotry in other words paper genocide. How they protect this agenda through socialism and manipulative programming, like social media and compulsory institutional education for instance, not knowing they been setup from day one seeing the fact they've systematically placed religious organization in their communities to place them in compriseable situation. Then again why would the govt initiate many times historically preemptive strikes on there own citizens, a specific \textbf{ethnic} group of citizens who are classified as minorities and yet they still trust the govt?....... All this \textbf{black} identity extremist labelling shit is unconstitutional and inorganic to the Americas, the US is only a corporation, where the term corporation derive from the verbiage corporate which it is synonymous with the word corpse, corpse it a dead body... The legalese meaning of corporation is an dead entity, as it being a foreign construct.

To grow up like that is awful beyond hope. We need not to fight whites but only to stay in school and learn.

There will still be troubles yes and there are whites that will be stupid but you just go one and take care of your family because shooting people will not make them accept you and say welcome but they will respect you if they see you as a group that love learning instead of hanging out on the streets and eating up your baby mama's food she brought for your kid and her other baby by another guy with food stamps.

It's hard work to organize these groups and I love that you want to do something good but I have seen this in my lifetime and have had enough. My sisters and brothers decided to put all their kids into college and stop listening to this stuff and it was hard because as a parent you had to do without and if there was no food one of us helped the other and if rent was due another one of us helped with that and you worked two jobs and another one on weekends but they are all out of college now and doing well. It's just as hard as what you do and maybe harder to do but it last a life time. Always spend your energy well on GOOD things and not things that just sound good. Want to rule the world? Then learn.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Open Eyes NOw Sean, perhaps you are innocent and only a regular deceived christian, not aware of the true nature of Christianity, and are totally unaware of the evil and hypocrisy in the church, as many are, listen to this:ÔÉò John 3:16-18  "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. (17)  For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. (18)  Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.Now, this is all fine and dandy, it seems right that we need to believe in Jesus to be 'saved,' and when it says that he did not come to condemn the world, but to save us, that all sounds fine; especially if you already believe, or if you have not read the Bible in its entirety. But a further consideration and dwelling on what the ramifications of this teaching are, brings some serious questions; and some open avenues to opposing contradictory doctrines. Now we just read some of the Sermon on the Mount, the recorded words (some of which are in more than two gospels, appearing to be with more than one author) of Jesus himself, which are in direct opposition to that teaching. Now, I know, I know, many of you will say that we have to take all scriptures in context, take into account what the intentions were, and the original language. I agree, especially with the part about context. But there is too much evidence showing that the truth is far from being represented in this particular scripture, as well as most of the rest of them, at least if you believe the Bible is the word of God and has some truth to it. If you don't believe in God, or if you think that the bible is only stories and fairy tales, then this portion of this book is not for you. Remember that I believed in the Bible as infallible and inerrant for ten years, and believed and obeyed God to the utmost, as well as studying his word and making him the most overwhelmingly important object of my life. I take this all very seriously, and when other very serious people read this, they are going to get seriously angry (not at me). I am angry. For good reason. Read on. These three verses irritate me and surpassingly vex me. Sixteen says that Jesus was put in the world because God loves us. So far, so good. Seventeen says his intention was not to condemn us. What a blatant whopping lie!! In the \textbf{Old} Testament, there is no mention of hell, but with the introduction of Jesus, hell enters the picture. The very next verse says if you don't believe in him, or even if you don't have his name right, he condemns you to hell!!?? Why, Jesus, why? Because he loves you!?!?There is some serious deception going on.

When really, the situation is so nuanced it's an insult to try and measure it down to systemic oppression. A \textbf{black} guy in Baltimore will have an easier go of 2ns degree assault or distribution than a white guy in Idaho. Colin Powell's son would evade serious judgement easier than a white \textbf{junkie},multiple drug arrests,fom Chicago.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@LAZARUS JOHNSON  No, I understand the underlying biases and generalizations, some blacks contend against. I never said \textbf{racism} doesn't exist, you make the assertion \textbf{racism} or structural \textbf{racism} or the white \textbf{patriarchy} hierarchy is the sole instigator of the problem. You're wrong, systemic \textbf{racism} is all but abolished and \textbf{racism} itself is as taboo as incest, which, judging by your ability to digest and comprehend layers of analysis, seems to be something you're familiar with.What about \textbf{black} on \textbf{black} crime? What is the effects of fatherless homes, in the \textbf{black} community? Shit, or even a positive Male figure, in general? How does laws and programs, designed to deteriorate the family, unbind community, and make us suckling \textbf{pigs} reliant on the government, impact urban, majority people of color, communities? How is it a \textbf{black} child, born and raised in 1950's Harlem, received a more complete education and flourishes, as opposed to a white child, born and schooled in Las Vegas, Nevada. Will Smith's son , without a doubt, is more well off than the average Asian boy of West Baltimore. You ignore context, detail, and nuance. There are more factors, in terms of sentencing, than what crime was committed. Drugs, for instance. Crack is given greater punishment, agreed. People would say it's because blacks get arrested with that substance more. The truth is, blacks sell crack and whites use crack.   People go to prison, not talkin jail, for distribution, not possession. You have to compile a record to get time for possession. So what about angel dust? It has the same  punishment for the same amounts as crack, and a large majority of those distributing and using crystal meth are white. \textbf{Black} legislators were tired of seeing crack, an effective device to destroy a community, ravaging the inner city, so they rallied for harder sentences for crack. Crystal Meth and Crack are similar in effectiveness for distribution and form. Colin Powell's son, with a clean arrest record, gets arrested with ten pills of heroin, he will have an easier go of it in a democratic city, like New York, as opposed to a white \textbf{junkie}, arrested multiple times for loitering, trespassing,  possession, and public intoxication, in a conservative state, with the same ten pills of heroine.The legacy of slavery and \textbf{Jim C\textbf{row}} is minuscule and diminutive, but it surely has its place in this discussion. As does school choice, which would benefit blacks, exponentially. Shifting a cultural ideology that sees the males perpetuate violence, drugs, denigrating women, toughness over morality, and an unwillingness to cooperate with domestic police in order to keep the community safe. All these things effect the white community, to some degree or another, agreed. But, the problem is compounded by the vicious narrative their is some omnipotent intangible force, everpresent and hypervigilant in it's attempt to quell people of color. The white Supremacist \textbf{patriarchy} myth perpetuated by radicals, of both extremes, and Democrats moreover. A notion that is insulting and repulsive, to whites, sure, but to \textbf{black} moreover. Impressing upon the world they are too weak and stunted to ever overcome the \textbf{racism} and oppression of a band of vague retards in pointy hoods.

Distribution and manufacturing is what gets you prison time. Also, a notable percent of distributions are plead down. I was caught allegedly selling  cocaine. Caught with 7 pills, allegedly.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Joseph Zebron Back years ago (2013-2015)i was researching it more, and every week were unarmed blacks being killed by cops. most were unreported by media. Just a couple of weeks ago, in my home town, Newark, a cop killed a \textbf{black} man and almost killed another. it was not reported anywhere except in the Newark Patch, a small local enewsletter, and few noticed it. I found a website that reports people killed by cops, so far this year 372, but it did not include the one killed here, so it is obviously not complete. YOu probably have no basis for your numbers, and no real knowledge. I was in prison, and most people there were for drugs, most dealing, some possession Blacks are far over-represented in prison, and it is a fact that an equal percentage of all races do drugs, but four times as many blacks are arrested for drugs, and ten times as many imprisoned as whites. NO \textbf{racism}? BS.

Or how about the \textbf{black} panthers when they brought about the \textbf{communist} \textbf{African} revolution of 1968 in America?

Just remember \textbf{african} Americans that everything you use or own was invented by whites and Asians. Without us the world would litteraly be in a caveman like state, for Godsakes Africa didn't even invent the wheel on their own. Don't you dare bring up Egypt eiether, the Demoniac (the spoken language of ancient Egypt) word for 'Nubian' is the same word they have for 'rubbish or waste'.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The problem with a group like this is universal: Your mission now might be self defense, but your second in command might see things differently. When you base your movement against someone else, like the police, and are training with weapons; It might only take one event to change the movement to "pro-actionary" as he has already said, ie. attacking the police for being police, (as he already showed support for online)...    Combine that with the fact this guy was trained how to kill people by the US government.  It's not surprising in the least that they have a file with the FBI, as the FBI has a file on every single activist group today.  There was just an article about a group of 5 or 6 white seniors who were environmental activists in Florida, and the FBI had a file on them as well.  The sad thing is the man here is in a good position, as a veteran, to be involved with the police and help bridge the gap between them and the \textbf{black} community in his own area.  I see a lot of comments here about how white militia groups are able to open carry and not be harassed.  The difference is usually that militia groups do not align themselves against the police, attempt to be in a position to help assist the police, include the police in their ranks, and at the very least, are in contact and good standing with law enforcement and other first responders.Nowhere in the video did I see any mention of the organization going and talking to the local police.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small WHITE ON WHITE CRIME   The DOJ's Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) numerically disproved people of color's alleged criminality in '\textbf{Race} and Hispanic Origin of Victims and Offenders, 2012-15,' which it released last Thursday (October 19). Using data from its National Crime Victimization Survey, the BJS puts a serious dent in \textbf{race}-baiting anti-crime arguments. The following three takeaways, among others, contradict the recurring claims about who actually assaults, murders or otherwise threatens White people: 1) White violent criminals disproportionately attack White victims. 'Among White victims, a higher percentage of victimizations were committed by white offenders (57 percent) than offenders of any other \textbf{race}. White victims perceived the offender to be \textbf{Black} in 15 percent of violent victimizations and Hispanic in 11 percent.'2) White-on-White crime exceeds Latinx-on-Latinx crime rates, as well as those for crimes committed across races. 'During 2012-15, the rate of White-on-White violent crime (12.0 per 1,000 White persons) was about four times higher than \textbf{Black}-on-White violent crime (3.1 per 1,000). The rate of \textbf{Black}-on-\textbf{Black} violent crime (16.5 per 1,000 \textbf{Black} persons) was more than five times higher than White-on-\textbf{Black} violent crime (2.8 per 1,000). The rate of Hispanic-on-Hispanic violent crime (8.3 per 1,000 Hispanic persons) was about double the rate of White-on-Hispanic (4.1 per 1,000) and \textbf{Black}-on-Hispanic (4.2 per 1,000) violent crime.

What the man is doing is installing a self-governing security mechanism in his community where traditional state security already exists. The government cannot allow public order to be installed by civilians because it undermines their already installed government mechanism.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small there are all sorts of stories of FBI targeting white extremists. Ting is, it would be nice if the \textbf{black} community would admit that there are problems within their community without deflecting to white people. We have our issues as well but so does the \textbf{black} community. Maybe things would change if they accept that \textbf{racism} is not their only problem. all I hear is any issue in the \textbf{black} community is somehow a symptom of white supremacy. I can accept that there are racial injustices while accepting that things have changed and just because not everything in racial equity has changed that doesn't mean \textbf{nothing} has.That not any peoples are perfect and by charging that all your problems are the burden of others biases is insinuating that your culture is indeed perfect ,hence why very little changes, so that in ten years or twenty, \textbf{nothing} will change and the \textbf{black} community will be saying the same thing about inequity, comparing their culture and lack of social standing  to other cultures as proof that \textbf{racism} must still be worse than ever, rather than as proof that they have never addressed the real issues that may lie within their own community . Even in this documentary, it puts the burden on the state as the \textbf{black} community is yet  another victim of some heavy handed racial tactics, taking part truths of police violence  and making them full truths that encompass every interaction, thus justifying any behavior. We can carry the burden of \textbf{racism} but that's not the \textbf{black} communities only issue .Think of this term racial bias, that in itself is progress, right?  proof that the system is indeed rather so much more  solid in addressing inequity in that we have to rely on something like biases, a thought crime essentially.. Now I'm not saying things are perfect but accountability works both ways. We couldn't use the same bathroom 40 years ago and still by almost every metric \textbf{black} people are failing, yet by almost every metric access to the mainstream economy, equality, \textbf{black} representation has grown as segregation has lessened. So there is a correlation between these racial inequities but not a direct correlation.  If there was then my almost every metric \textbf{black} people would be better off, not stagnant year after year as society progresses.  That leads me to believe the biggest variable is not really white peoples biases or injustice but something else, another variable that keeps being ignored because pointing to \textbf{race} is too easy and convenient.  \textbf{Race} can be part of the conversation but it is always ALL the conversation, ignoring any context.People are too worried about not letting white people off the hook,  failing to admit our own progressing  social attitudes towards \textbf{race} and wanting to create a bias against all white people as racists.Its too simple to keep pointing the mirror at us for decades without ever pointing the mirror back.  They keep telling us to clean our room, and we need to, but mean while yours is burning and everybody is terrified to tell you. and its not helping. Culture can change, its not genetics, but not if you never ever admit fault. it is ultimately good that people have no issue telling white people our problems. Maybe  its time for the \textbf{black} community to be uncomfortable with their own community instead of being comfortable only speaking on ours. only being comfortable with this narrative of racial inequity and the moral high ground they can clami because of it. Its nice that no matter the problem they can point at white people as the culprits. to a point where without \textbf{racism} it would be embarrassing, but with \textbf{racism} its white people that are embarrassed and the \textbf{black} man can come off as a heroic defender of values.  So its convenient to keep this narrative of \textbf{racism}., of course \textbf{racism} exists. but a lot has changed and maybe its time to evaluate yourselves. We have other stuff to worry about other than keeping you down. So ask yourselves, is it more important to keep this card in your pocket and this moral authority and name calling or admit that you have some issues all your own like every one else, and  change things?

I'll tell you why voting Republican is better. For years the \textbf{black} community has been voting democrat which they have been telling us that we cant take care of our self and we need help because we are helpless victims, so they bribe us knowing poor \textbf{black} families wouldn't say no to "free money" aka welfare. Ever since the welfare programs were introduced to the \textbf{black} community, we have been becoming increasingly poor and the single motherhood rate has skyrocketed. It's hard to say thats it's not the government's fault because they started coming to these mothers houses to make sure the father wasnt living there. The 1 thing the hurts the \textbf{black} community is our broken family structure. MLK used to say that as long as our family is strong we can thrive. Republicans have always been about keeping the government small and decreasing welfare to make sure \textbf{black} families can move up and yes that includes all races. The polices of the democrat party are bad for us as \textbf{black} people and we are getting bribed for votes.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!5}6/209 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.871 \\  \hline

It wasnt just MLK that pointed out how important the family structure was, Obama did too. Obama said that too many fathers were missing from too many lives back in 08.

They don't take any jobs that I want, they do pay taxes and I know this from firsthand experience, and Hispanic crime is very low. With that being said, I do think they should come here legally so if he wants to build a wall, i don't care. I just think the issue is over rated tho, I've looked at the statistics. White people get arrested just as much as \textbf{black} people though but they do not get charged as much and they don't get charged as severely for the same exact crimes which can contribute to an excess of \textbf{black} ppl in prison as well. Also, I don't deny \textbf{black} on \textbf{black} crime isn't high but something that is worth considering is that people do commit crimes in their own community. A white person is more likely to get killed by another white person, just as a Mexican is more likely to get killed by another Mexican and etc. Hate speech is a thing.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The Dred Scott Case:Dred Scott V. John F. A. Sandford U.S. Supreme Court 1857.This case is a must read for all of you whom identify as Blacks, Negros, Latin, Hispanics, and Afro-\textbf{Colored}-Americans, to gain some comprehension on how you and your Legal Status are viewed in the eyes of the law.This case was and still is monumental not only in this country but also around the world. For in it the foundations of Status and the Importance of \textbf{Nationality} are revealed.1.) Dred Scott claimed to be a \textbf{Negro} of \textbf{African} Ancestry and was suing his former slave master for assault while he was a slave to John Sanford. Dred Scott was suing for assault not only himself, but also his wife Harriet, and his two daughters Eliza, and Lizzie.The courts, first of all, made it known that Dred Scott was a Plaintiff In Error as you will find out why.2.) The following is quoted from the opening pleas of the case:"Dred Scott, is not a citizen of the State of Missouri, as alleged in his declaration, because he's a \textbf{negro} of \textbf{African} descent; his ancestors were of pure \textbf{African} blood and were brought into this country and sold as \textbf{negro} slaves, and this the said Sandford is ready to verify."3.) So off the top, we see that the Supreme Court did not recognize Dred Scott's citizenship, because he claimed to be a "\textbf{negro} of \textbf{African} Decent".4.) This is important not because the U.S. had no intentions of including negros as protected citizens for the sake of being biased, but because in law, one's Legal Status is the 1st thing taken into consideration.5.) So when Dred Scott claimed to be a \textbf{negro} from the decent of \textbf{African} slaves, he automatically identified himself as the Property of slave masters.6.) As we know property does not have the right to sue anything, just like your shoes cannot sue you for wear and tear, because property has no rights.The Outcome states the following:7.) "The judgment finding that respondent was not liable to petitioner for assault was reversed and the case was remanded with an order to dismiss the action for lack of jurisdiction.8.) The Supreme Court held that petitioner was not a citizen and could not bring the action in the court because petitioner was a Slave of \textbf{African} descent."9.) Here we see the Supreme Court could not properly rule on the case because it lacked the capacity to do so because of the Status of Dred Scott, which needed to be addressed in the Lower courts of Appeal.10) The Order of the Court is Status, Jurisdiction, Adjudication, Trial, and then Sentencing. Jurisdiction is the courts Authority of the parties in question or the Subject-Matter at had.11.) Since Dred Scott lacked proper status as a Citizen, the court lacked jurisdiction over the matter, and at this point, the only thing that can happen is a reversal or a mandate back to the lower courts for them to correct their mistakes.Quoted from the Lawyers Edition Headnotes:12.) "Plea in abatement, when may be reviewed - the word "citizen" in the constitution does not embrace one of the \textbf{negro} \textbf{race} - \textbf{negro} cannot become a citizen - slave not made free by residence in a free state of territory - Declaration of Independence does not include slaves as part of the people - the rights and privileges conferred by the Constitution upon citizens do not apply to the \textbf{negro} \textbf{race} - Constitution should have the meaning intended when it was adopted - court may examine other errors in abatement - Constitution expressly affirms right of property in slaves- ."13.) So here again we see that when you identify yourself as a \textbf{black}, \textbf{colored}, \textbf{negro} form Afro- America you identify yourself as slave property, which has \textbf{Zero} protected rights.More quotes from the Dred Scott Case:14.) " The provisions of the Constitution of the United States in relation to the personal rights and privileges to which the citizen of a state should be entitled, do not embrace the \textbf{negro} \textbf{African} \textbf{race}, at that time in this country, or who might afterwards be imported, who had been or should afterwards be made free in any state."15.) "The Constitution of the United States does not act upon one of the \textbf{negro} \textbf{race} whenever he shall be free under the laws of a state, and raise him to the rank of a citizen, and immediately clothe him with all the privileges of a citizen of any other state, and in its own courts."16.) "The legislation and histories of the times, and the language used in the Declaration of Independence, show that neither the class of persons who had been imported as slaves, nor their descendants, whether they had become free or not, were then acknowledged as part the people, nor intended to be included in the general words used in that instrument.17.) "The enslaved \textbf{African} \textbf{race} was not intended to be included in, and formed no part of, the people who framed and adopted the Declaration of Independence."18.) So we can plainly see that \textbf{negro} is a class of persons defined as slave property whom shall never be afforded the constitutionally protected rights as a citizen, and neither shall the offspring of those whom call themselves negroes.19.) Justice H.A. Garland stated the following about all the so-called negroes:" Now, the following are truths which a knowledge of the history of the world, and particularly of that of our own country, compels us to know - that the \textbf{African} \textbf{negro} \textbf{race} have never been acknowledged as belonging to the family of nations; that as amongst them there never has been known or recognized by the inhabitants of other countries anything partaking of the character of \textbf{Nationality} or civil or political polity; that this \textbf{race} has been by all the nations of Europe regarded as subjects of capture or purchase; as subjects of commerce or traffic; and that introduction of that \textbf{race} into every section of this country was not as members of civil or political society, but as slaves, as property in the strictest sense of the term."20.) Here we see the Supreme Court Justice made the correct decision, which was not based out of \textbf{racism} as some may suppose but based on the fact that there is no Negroland, there is no \textbf{Negro} Flag, there is no \textbf{Negro} Constitution or Embassy of the Negros, so without the components that would show that this so-called \textbf{negro} exist as a \textbf{nation} of people, the courts are not bound to recognize a person or people whom call themselves something that has never existed in history, and has no known historical origins.21.) This applies to \textbf{African}, because Africa is a Continent, with many Nations. \textbf{Black}, Afro-American, and \textbf{Colored} also fall under the same categories of a Stateless person or those whom have no known \textbf{nationality}.22.) Being a \textbf{black}, \textbf{colored}, \textbf{negro}, from Afro-America puts you outside of the human family of nations. It's not a \textbf{racist} thing, it's just a fact of law.23.) When you run around here with the socialized mis-conditioning that you are a \textbf{negro}, \textbf{black}, \textbf{colored}, from Afro-America you are telling the world that you are a renegade pirate, because you have no known \textbf{Nationality}, which means you have no Family or origin, which means you have no In-laws, which means that you are an Outlaw, and are operating Outside of the Law.24.) This is the reason why the poor \textbf{negro} has the problems he/she experiences in his/her own land, because the so-called \textbf{negro} has refused to "Honor his father and Mother, by proclaiming his/her \textbf{nationality} as a Moorish American that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest live long on the earth", as stated in the 1st of the 10 commandments.25.) Keep in mind that due to how big this case is the legislation decided to capitalize this concept even further through the introduction of the 14th Amendment, which passed Corporate citizenship to all of those whom choose to operate outside of their \textbf{nationality}.26.) The Remedy and Recourse for all of this is to Proclaim your \textbf{Nationality} as a Moorish American, return to the Culture and Customs of your Ancient Foremothers and Forefathers right here in America, correct your Legal Status, then your birthrights protected by the U.S. Constitution can be enforced, because you have changed your status from a dead, Corporate entity, to a living breathing Natural Person, whom is part of a body politic, and a \textbf{Nation}, whom the laws are afforded to, and are recognized around the world.You must proclaim your \textbf{Nationality} Moors!Peace and Love!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}African, Black, Colored, Nation, Nationality, Negro, Race, Racism, Racist, Zero & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}59/1465 & \cellcolor{green!27}4.027 \\  \hline

But one difference between a legit militia, concerned with protecting the rights of the People and upholding the constitution, and a potential threat to public safety, is that the latter tends to hide their faces as they intend to break the law and don't want to be identified. A legit militia of citizens is proud to be a member, and won't hide their face, as they have no need to hide their identity. That is why the KKK should also be considered domestic terrorists. They hide their faces, as they know what they are promoting or willing to do is immoral. They know their extremism is potentially damaging to their reputations. So they want to exercise their extremism, while remaining able to have a job and exist in civilized society. Thus masks are necessary for them too. This guy sympathized with domestic terrorism. Posting something like "Today one year ago one \textbf{black} man brought Dallas Pig Department to their knees," indicates that he thinks that type of thing is OK. THAT makes him a threat. To even have a brain capable of NOT empathizing, to have a mind incapable of seeing death as a bad thing regardless of whom has died... that indicates a sociopathic mindset.  He says he thinks he shouldn't be in the same category of those that flew planes into buildings on 9/11, but by his own statements, if someone flew a plane into, say, a police department building, that would probably be something he would admire. And he is simply WRONG that his "political opinion doesn't affect one law enforcement agent or a police officer." His political opinion, one of animosity towards cops, encourages violence in others. Sure, he might not be violent, and just carries around a massive firearm and conducts hand to hand combat training for the fun of it. But he has opinions that make it seem like it is commendable to kill cops. That opinion makes others that have the same opinion feel justified in taking action, even if he won't. Your beliefs and opinions don't live in a vacuum, especially if you post them on social media. Protesting police violence and doing violence against the police are two totally different things. First amendment rights always apply. But nowhere should you be allowed to incite hatred against others, encourage violence against others, etc. To do such is merely one step away from taking those violent actions yourself. It is typically the action of a coward to incite hatred in others to motivate them into violence. But it is also a heinous and immoral action to just be the one doing the hate-mongering. But there is certainly an issue where the government has no problem ignoring the rhetoric of the white extremists, and even promote their views, using idiots like InfoWars as source material to justify their idiocy. WHY is it so hard to get a government in place that isn't extremist one way or the other? Why does it have to be either authoritarian ultra-liberalism OR authoritarian ultra-conservatism? Why does the government have to be irrationally oppressive to at least some large subsection of the population?

Look beyond color for a minute man. Screaming racial slurs and speaking hatefully amongst one's own color is a sad, misguided existence, yes... but recruiting and training armed soldiers, to prepare for a rebellion, IS SO MASSIVELY DIFFERENT. in that way, the \textbf{Black} Identity Extremists are different from MODERN DAY white nationalist racists. they are a similar group in that they are based off of all being the same \textbf{race}, not allowing any other \textbf{race} into their group, and harboring the same \textbf{racism} as the other groups, just towards white people. I assume you're an intelligent person since you're actually taking the time to look into this and read my comment, so consider my point man... look up videos of what happened at the very beginning of the Charlottesville riot... all the WN protesters were chanting something semi-\textbf{racist}, and all the sudden violent opposers came up and began throwing things at them and throwing punches. The WN protesters did not incite the violence, and this is a proven fact. these B.I.E. guys are genuinely concerning to anyone who's not born into the \textbf{black} \textbf{race}.. what's gonna happen when they're convinced all white people are racists out to hold them back? will white people be attacked in the streets, like when Trump won? \textbf{crazy} shit man. the media twists the hell out of these stories.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Crazy, Race, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}10/292 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.425 \\  \hline

Should we go out of our way to aid in the social elevation of \textbf{black} peoples, simply based on \textbf{race}? that seems like it's moving BACK toward a \textbf{race}-ran society, a society where people are on different levels due to skin color.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Jim JonesI see where you're coming from but I think it has more to do with class.  Rich \textbf{black} people are not oppressed.  Poor white people are.  Where are lynchings still happening today?  The actual law that said a \textbf{black} man is 3/5 had to do with 3/5 of a vote, not 3/5 rights...at that time they had no rights since that law allowed slave owners to maintain control by allowing them to essentially have extra votes (hence more political power).  The actual slave wasn't allowed to vote he was told who to vote for, so it's not really his vote. There was a white militia member in a story that Vice did that show him making general threats toward federal law enforcement personnel (no one specific) and was promptly arrested.  There was the white guy at Ruby Ridge in Idaho where they killed the guy's wife and very young son for a weapons violation. He had not been making any threats. If police get ambushed by a bunch of different people with the same cause in a very short period of time, then someone praises the actions of the killer(s), is in a group that is armed and has a \textbf{common} agreement on the issue, I don't think that qualifies as him being oppressed.  I'm not saying \textbf{black} people in the hood aren't mistreated, but this dude isn't helping the situation.  He was in the Marine Corps and probably could have been a cop.  That's how you make things better. Yes, there is still \textbf{racism}, yes, but your taking everything that MIGHT BE \textbf{racism} and factually assume that IT IS \textbf{racism}.

You can not expect to have it any other way in a world ruled by Devils.  Some of us still appear to be in a state of shock when we hear of these types of things happening.  They fear us because they fear The Most High.  We are at war not because we are a danger to them outright.  We are at war and a danger to them because they know who we are.  It is that simple.  The proof of this truth is the fact that they have come after us in every situation they could think of to oppress and inevitably kill us.  We have not retaliated but that has not stopped them from continuing to make up reasons to hunt us like the animals they say we are - like the animals they truly are!   It is not necessary to arm ourselves against their hate, because it just gives a demonic controlled mind the incentive to use it as the reason for their wickedness against us.  Whether we are armed or not, the result is the same because we are called by The Most High and they are doomed by Him.  The only way they feel they can get back at Him is through us - by oppressing us - denying us our rights - keeping us in a state of confusion - pitting us against one another - lying to themselves about us - creating situations purposely to kill us...etc.  This has been our reality, living in the world ruled by their father the devil.  But the time is ripe for change and it will not come from us attacking them.  We do not have to become like them - though some of us have already because the pressure to remain peaceful under the circumstances has been too much for them to bare.  We have someone they do not have who is going to and has already begun to set matters straight.  Their curses have begun to visit them - which is a sign for us and them, without us lifting a finger against them.  We have to continue to remain patient for but a short time more.  That has also been our reality as well.  We have been patient beyond measure, something which if they had been us and things were in reverse, they could never do.  They would have destroyed the planet already, by now...which they are also doing.  Their destruction is already taking place.  Just continue to be patient and you will shout for joy shortly!

In that time David Koresh was allowed to received food and broadcast radio sermons AND this was after they had already shot and killed 4 ATF agents.

After all, the police are saying we need to get "weapons of murder off the streets" while they can wield those same weapons. But my point is that whenever a citizen goes away from the system, there is always some sort of an illegal catch 22 they can nail him or her for. We are saying a lot of the same things; but my primary concern is that police brutality and over reach  is often overlooked until theres a \textbf{race} issue. Don't get me wrong, the \textbf{race} issues going on with the police are important, but I feel alot of these officers wouldnt be so emboldened to try and get away with it if they didnt have the amount of overreach they currently have.

Also when white folk descent, complain etc they are not told to return to Europe etc.  I don't care if my ancestors worked for free...they STIlL are an integral part to America because their hands literally helped build this \textbf{nation}.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@JacquelynnThe reason Africans do not view so-called Blacks as Africans,  is because the African's know the so-called Blacks are not Africans.  Jacquelynn,  ask yourself,  Would you sell your Father, Mother, Brother, or Sister into slavery?   Well,  the Africans wouldn't do it either.   The so-called Blacks in America today are the original Jews that migrated to the West Coast of Africa from Israel to escape persecution from the Romans (in 70 AD).   During the Trans Atlantic Slave Trade,  they targeted young slaves less than 20 years of \textbf{age},  so that in one generation all former history,  language,  and culture would be lost.   After the abolishment of slavery,  they established a multitude of  hate groups and  \textbf{Jim C\textbf{row}} Laws  to continuously murder and oppress God's people.   When \textbf{Jim C\textbf{row}} no longer worked,   they used Martin Luther King to promote integration and assimilation -  this ideology has completely destroyed our people.   Because of integration,  they control  the curriculum that is taught in our schools so we can't learn the truth about our history  and  people.  Through the ideology of assimilation  they promote the 'American Dream'  to brainwash  our youth to strive for employment  that will help strengthen   'their country',   which was stolen from the Native Americans.

I doubt the FBI feels that these activists are organized or present any real political threat, but for sure the FBI has a legitimate concern that another deranged individual might be influenced by all of this social media activity to try to kill another police officer.Does this justify the FBIs actions? Maybe not, but this report fails to even consider the argument.  The reporter was also quite uncritical and accepting of Balogun's ideological beliefs and actions.  Why does Balogun think it is ok to celebrate a mass murderer on social media?  What about other members of the community he is supposedly protecting? Do they support him marching around the neighborhood with an ar-15? None of these questions were asked.

You're right, \textbf{black} people don't have a history of harming white people in the past. Not that they wouldn't, they just didn't have the means to do so. White culture had a history of building ships and sailing and invading other nations, be it white or \textbf{black} or whatever. Just look at the Vikings or the Romans or whomever. Sub-Saharan Africans were just never that sophisticated and couldn't build anything that would transport him like that. I mean, they still dance around campfires in Africa and throw spears at lions to this very day. But given the chance, they did war with each other, and they constantly still do if you look at the Rwandan genocide and so on, and also given the chance, they will attack innocent white people as you currently see happening on farms in South Africa. In the past, their tribes went to war with other tribes, took prisoners, and sold them to Arabs for slavery. Let's not make any mistake about it, you were not the innocent oppressed people. You guys have a violent past and have caused, and in many cases still do, a lot of people misery. You can't blame white people of today for the actions of the whites in the 17 and 1800s. All you're doing is perpetuating the hate that is dividing our country. You blame the police and your suicidal downfall for the antics you and your community get up to.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Another person that doesn't understand statistics. There are more white people overall so of course more white people will be killed by police but a \textbf{black} person is twice as likely to be killed by a police officer therefore you are more likely to be killed by a cop if you are \textbf{black} than if you are white even though overall there are more white people killed by cops than \textbf{black} people. I know, maths isn't for everyone. Let me add more perspective. About 60 of the population is white and about 13 \textbf{black}. That small 13 (actually about 4 if we take out women and children to just leave men) is twice as likely to get killed over that 60. Let that sink in.

The video, didnt have alot about his goals ( that my his style,, his stradedgy with media, from the ways he's learned things or researched things in the past) .    I think he wants a camrea with him at all times on him for him.  his story, the movement, what there about, was kind of not really there.   I saw guns, training videos, group activities, and exercises, they probbly do alot fun stuff too.  like cook outs and all that .  i'm really quite sure, i havnt read any \textbf{black} panther books, but it seems like he's (they are) on a path to do it better than him.     I would really like to emphasis, they American identity thing.  It includes you. It also includes, all the police,  all american the government.     Somebody say,  if there every talking to Rakem,   "Hey Rakem,  there are these people, who make policy, who encompass "pointing the finger" threats and dangers, they encompass them onto the community, there called senators"   they dont go by "american" or citizen so to speak.   So if your ever up on a balcony,outside looking down, at city, with people, cars, pedistrians walking,police will be there, protestors, maybe a music festival and some other events are going on down there.    If  down at the city, your state, your town, your country, ( thats your country).  looking at all of it together,  its one thing.    You wont see the senators there, the ones in office  ( encompassing the community together, as scheme) you wont see congress down there.  But you will see, all the people, from your neighboords and communities, police will be ne of them most likely. When you go down there you with everything too, you may have feelling or better perspective on it than alot of them.  But its all there.    So shootings, in the neighboorhood or city, with those people who i mentioned "are there",  americans.   those should all be in the past.  put all those in the past.  TGB the way i mean it.  You are American Rakem Balogun,  so imagine if all those people down there, are on your side.  all of them.

Training people regardless of \textbf{race} and ideology legally, can be turned into a business and can be educational and used to reduce crime and violence in the neighborhood.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Ken McLeod Unfortunately, it's not me that post flat out lies it's you. The source from which you gathered your  information is from a website called the Gateway Pundit, a website who is known even by Wikipedia to "spread falsehoods and hoaxes." Its founder Jim Hoft, has been under fire for spreading false stories himself.  Your website caters to those with far right views.   Everything I posted can be found and verified by reliable sources. Therefore I.m not changing my position. Your, so called, facts are false and you know this.   You know good and well BLM did not kill anyone.   This is what you said: BLM is an extremist hate group who have murdered 11 Police Officers on their hands. Lies. Firstly, they are not a extremist. 2nd they are not \textbf{racist}, 3rdly they are not a hate group.    Research outside of your Far Right Gateway Pundit will tell you that.    The information you gathered about BLM, Micah Johnson, and the \textbf{Black} Panthers were all false. This you know.    BLM:  your claim that they murdered 11 police officers, is false. There's not one reliable source that states that claim. ". . .calling for the death of white people and especially white cops" is not the same as killing white people. Something BLM has not done. Your views on the \textbf{Black} Panthers is skewed simply because you refuse to understand why they came about to begin with. There's not one source that will tell you about the \textbf{black} panthers being "violent and killed many white people". Nowhere can that claim be found. Incidentally, thas the view that most white people who are ignorant about the \textbf{Black} Panthers are ready to accept just because anything pro \textbf{black} is seen as an instant threat to white people with far right thinking. Now I will agree with you the New \textbf{Black} Panthers is a whole nother breed. And it's no secret that they have called for the death of white people, even their genocide. However, again, calling for and doing are two totally different things. Nowhere can you find even the most extreme \textbf{black} panther actually going out and committing violence against white people. Nowhere.  In the case of Micah Johnson, your claim of these alleged voicemails cannot be found anywhere. Oops. I guess you lied again.  ~ What is factual is that Micah was upset about BLM. ~ His support of BLM, in which you claim, is false. His own words he proclaimed \textbf{nothing} in support of BLM. ~what is fact is that, once again he was a lone gunman. "He said he was upset about BLM, . . .upset about recent police shootings, and upset at white people." Facts. ~He was not affiliated with any groups. Facts.~As a matter of fact, Pro \textbf{black} power groups would not accept Micah because they deemed him to be unstable or "unfit for recruitment". Micah was blacklisted. Thus whatever he felt for white folk, namely police officers, he acted alone. The information on the white supremacists doing the most extreme killings still stands true.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Ken McLeod I almost didnt see your post responding to the BLM etc.   Again, you havent shown evidence proving BLM murdered 11 police officers. You are a man that stands on verifiable, tangible proof. Show me a link that says exactly as you say that they killed 11 police officers.        Just because a few people within the organization called for the death of police does not mean those are the sentiments of the movement. Again, calling for police death is not the same as committing it. This you know. BLM has not murdered anyone.     And you can look up all day long and not find BLM listed as being a \textbf{racist} hate group. Now granted, that might be the opinion of many white people who don't like or understand the purpose of BLM, but that does not mean they are a \textbf{racist} organization.      About the property damage: BLM is about peaceful protest. In many cases, you will find some unruly protesters within and many unruly protesters without that may operate in ways that are counterproductive to the groups main mission. However, the anger and frustration that those individuals feel tends to come out through property damage and harsh words, but again BLM has not murdered anyone. Those bad apples may have taken their frustrations out on property but not on people. And whatever you claimed about Micah Johnson still isn't true. And in my prior post I've proving you wrong. Everything I stated can be found.    And you insist on going on the narrative that the \textbf{Black} Panthers were a violent organization. If they were, why were they violent?  Everything you're saying about them is exactly what J Edgar Hoover wanted you (all whites) to believe. It's documented history that he wanted to sabotage the \textbf{Black} Panthers. Even after all of the heinous and terroristic acts the Klu Klux Klan had committed, for years, towards \textbf{black} people, he put out the statement that the \textbf{Black} Panthers were a "threat to National Security". And if one is honest in their research regarding the \textbf{Black} Panthers, something that I would like you to be, one would know that they were far from anything that J Edgar Hoover claimed them to be. If you can first acknowledge how terroristic the police and society was towards \textbf{black} people during that time then hopefully you can acknowledge why the existence of the \textbf{Black} Panthers came about to begin with.         I will acknowledge that Huey Newton did kill an officer and he served his time. However, the link you provided listing the officers that were killed by so-called \textbf{black} panthers I find that interesting, considering how J Edgar Hoover along with the FBI were using underhanded and manipulative methods with the purpose to defame/discredit and dismantle a group that was only standing up to injustices done to their people, and were well within their right to do so. But again the mission of white supremacy (J Edgar Hoover) was to have these \textbf{black} men been seen as a threat to National Security. In other words, a threat to white people.    And when one understands the level of sabotage put in by J Edgar Hoover and the FBI, I question the legitimacy of the link you provided;        it was no secret that the police and \textbf{black} panthers had bad blood, but if anything, there was more conflict and more bloodshed within the organization than it was on the outside. And this was all due to the manipulative hand of J Edgar Hoover and the FBI cointelpro.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Ken McLeod I can understand how BLM can be seen as a menace or nuisance to society. And its easy to understand how their approach can be off putting and misguided in the examples you gave. However, their main goal, tho frightfully annoying it may seem, is to bring awareness to the unarmed \textbf{black} lives lost by police who misused their power and authority in ways that should not have ended in death by the hands of the police.      Not only are the protest fueled by the fact that lives are lost, but when video footage shows improper use of police force, and the reckless ways in which the police handle the situation, on a number of occasions, prior to the footage being released, we have statements from cops stating how the altercation  conflict came about.. Many times the police give false statements and the statements are in conflict with what the video footage shows.        So when an unarmed \textbf{black} life is lost due to improper police force, people see how the police officer gets off. There's no arrests made, no prison time, sometime police officers are awarded and promoted to a higher rank. If there is a trial there are times when the officer manages to get off. These are the slaps in the face that causes frustration and anger and resentment towards not only the police, but the entire justice system.   Thus the reason why BLM exist. The good that BLM do is simply bringing awareness to a \textbf{blind} and unaware Society.   And actually some of the things that you listed that they do when they protest, their purpose is to agitate and be "in your face" with the information they're fighting for.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Blind & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}3/286 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.049 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Ken Mcleod You left out the fact that \textbf{black} people convicted of murder are more likely as in 50 more likely to be innocent than other convicted murderers. About 15 of murders commited by \textbf{black} people are done to white people but, these cases make up 31 of all \textbf{black} exoneration's. The convictions that have \textbf{black} people as defendants are 22 more likely to include police misconduct than those with white defendants, which does provide evidence for unconscious or conscious racial biases among the judicial system and the police force. Judging by exoneration's a \textbf{black} person serving time for \textbf{sexual} assault is three and half times as likely to be innocent than there white counterparts. Assault from a \textbf{black} man to a white women are the minority of cases, but they make up half of eye-witness misidentifications that lead to exoneration's.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Nah, that's b.s. and you know it.  Dylan Roof is a  \textbf{terrorist}.  He is also a \textbf{terrorist} that got the death penalty.  Have you ever considered that the authorities might be trying to prevent another Dylan Roof situation by keeping an eye on people who publicly post hate against  others?  Look at this guy's Facebook posts.  The Dallas Police shooting/attack where police were targeted and murdered is the subject that really got him in trouble.  He laughed at people being murdered and said good and they deserved it.  Being outraged that \textbf{black}  men have been killed by police is one thing.  To be happy and to endorse killing cops or other groups is quite another.  It speaks loudly that it's only wrong when it happens to \textbf{black} people and that all other people deserve to be murdered in cold blood.  Just like the \textbf{Black} Israelites who stand on street corners and yell at people.  Screaming at white men about how they are going  to be their slaves.  Screaming at white women about how when things turn around that they are going to be brutally raped by them.  They also claim God supports this.  It's hate.  Is it really about wanting equality, or is it actually about the desire to to be in a superior position of power so that they can force any kind  of treatment they want to on anyone without any consequences?  Long  before the Atlantic Slave Trade, there was the Barbary Coast Slave Trade.  Long before white Europeans colonized regions  of Africa, North America, South America, and  India, the Moors invaded and conquered the Iberian Peninsula.  Long before the white man ever owned slaves, the Bible Speaks of Abraham owning  slaves.  Yet \textbf{black} extremists like the \textbf{Black} Israelites ignore these facts and only see the suffering of people who look like them, forget that if they really are the descendants of the Israelites that it's documented how they owned slaves and how blacks have not only enslaved people of other races  over the years, but enslaved people of their own \textbf{race}, and their only wish is to be in  a position to further brutalize, enslave, rape, and steal from other races and groups  of people.  Again, it's only wrong  when it happens to \textbf{black} people, right?  This line of thinking  is even more harsh, hateful, and brutal than anything that has happened to anyone throughout history.  Yet people still endorse it because they belong to this particular \textbf{race} and want radicalism that works only in their favor.  "Good.  They deserved it" is exactly what he said about policemen being  murdered in the streets.  Did those particular policemen murder anyone?  Yet  it's  okay with him that they were targeted and murdered in cold blood just because they wear a uniform and a badge.  It speaks loudly that he sees one set of morals, standards, and rights for one group and clearly thinks anything goes for cops and people who do not look like him.  We are all being played and \textbf{black} people  who follow this man's line of thinking  are the biggest fools of  all.  Play right into the hands of the people who seek to control you.  Your people have suffered for centuries for this and if this line of thinking continues,  they will continue to suffer for it.  Not just the extremists - but everyone.

Yet you all refuse to accept it. And that is fine if you can't acclimate, you can always return to Africa and be among people who might share your beliefs a little better.  But if you choose to stay in America, where do you get off thinking you can make white people pay for your issues?  You're mad because Police profile you?  There's a reason they profile you.  You may not be bad, but far too many of your \textbf{race} are.  Chicago's a war zone because of many in your \textbf{race} (and about every other large city in the US.) I went to Trenton on business, stayed at a nice hotel in a nice part of town, and I was told by the staff to not go outside at night because of the violence your \textbf{race} brought to the city.  It's not hard to understand why they profile blacks.  You all need to accept that and fix your problems before pointing the finger t white people.  Stop being a victim. Oh, one last thing:  The Democratic party is still enslaving you.  They used to enslave your ancestors a long time ago through physical means.  For the past 50 years they've been enslaving you through welfare, food stamps, medicaid and other entitlements.  They tell you  that the Conservatives are out to get you and don't care about you and that if you vote for Liberals, they'll give you more from the nipple and thus keep you enslaved.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Isn't very smart to fiddle with your firearm while open carrying or in public, man or \textbf{woman} of any color. Keep it on your person with the sling or a holster, but anytime a gun is in hands people will understandably become nervous. Most firearms owners regard that as \textbf{common} sense, and I necessarily don't want to lose my right to carry a firearm because someone else couldn't keep it out of their hands and either created panic or injured another person from playing with it like a toy. The fact that this was at a public park on a park bench around who-knows how many children, and they couldn't show proper discipline is unacceptable. I am all for everyone enjoying their rights, but just because we can openly carry a firearm doesn't mean we should flaunt it while doing so. "Keep it in your pants" applies here, and that is why most gun owners just prefer concealed carry. I am uncomfortable even when I have to adjust my concealed carry rig in a way that might expose my firearm. Even if it means a bathroom stop for a simple belt adjust whilst shopping with my family because I know that it only takes one person with a skewed conception or ignorance on firearms laws; possibly even with just a bias on firearms to make the shopping trip quite possibly a disaster. If you value your self-defense and safety, you really should reconsider the situation you put yourself in when open-carrying; even more so if you can't keep the damn thing out of your hands and secured on your sling. Just because we can doesn't mean we always should, and the mistake isn't worth your own safety or that of others around you to prove a point. But if it is worth that to you, just don't fiddle with it on a park bench in open sight. Keep it respectfully secured to your person.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Common, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}2/324 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.617 \\  \hline

If the US government would do their job and take all that money they use for the phoney "war on drugs" in suburban neighborhoods, putting people of color in prison for things whites aren't put in jail for, and quit guaranteeing prison quotas,things would start to improve. If they'd put that money towards the people, businesses, and neighborhoods they obliterated during the 70's - the years the CIA brought coke into the inner cities, things would start to improve. If they'd spend more money on recruiting \textbf{black} police from the underserved areas, things would improve.Back in the 70's the CIA targeted \textbf{black} communities, then the govt spread propaganda about the breakdown of the \textbf{black} family. In other words, they caused problems by incarcerating \textbf{black} men and breaking their families apart. Until the government makes amends for that there will be more division among people. We need to get all of these \textbf{elderly} white men with Nixon era values out of govt and have a govt that actually represents the population.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small All I see is in the comments is how the FBI ignore the anti-govt white extremists. What about Waco, Ruby Ridge, Ted Kaczynski, some of the tactics used and rights they violated during the investigation were shady asf. Not saying that \textbf{racism} doesn't exist among law enforcement but the vast majority of it exists on an individual and not a national institutional level. Hate on an individual level is impossible to completely destroy but what's important is to look at if strides are being made to put forth measures to try an eliminate it on an institutional level, remove any barriers that exist for the purpose to intentionally deny the rights and opportunity for a certain demographic of people whether its \textbf{race}, \textbf{gender}, \textbf{age}, \textbf{sexual} orientation. And the sentiment in the country is Cleary moving towards that objective for the past 50 yrs which in reality is not a long period of time. No can say that minorities or \textbf{race} \textbf{gender} and \textbf{sex} orientation have less barriers and more opportunity on a national institutional level than 50, 25, 10 or even 5 yrs. And since the civil rights movement that line has consistently moved in that direction to the point now that not only previous barriers have been removed that would inhibit a demographic from having an equal opportunity as another citizen, but in recent years many policies have been instituted that would give a minority and added advantage not available to ever citizen like affirmative action for example. Although I can relate and understand that despite these inequality barriers have been removed for equal opportunities certain aspects in life make it harder than others to succeed in life like the economic viability of where you live, the level of public education available to children in those areas, and even the existence of individual prejudice of those in the community you are raised in. Those are all hurdles that are difficult to overcome that makes success harder than others who live in a different area and situation. But on a national level no law or policy is in place that prevents anyone from making ones own success or future like was in place 20, 50, 100, 150 yrs ago even though some people have to work harder then others. To guarantee equal opportunity for every one of the 325mil is near impossible and will like take along time if every to establish its a process which first has to start by guarennting equal rights for all and removing any systematic barriers that prevent that before work on ensuring equal opportunity for everyone which in this point in our history we are starting to work and strive for and is an almost impossible problem to solve, what matters most is as a \textbf{nation} which direction are we moving in regards to that issue which for the past 50+ yrs has been towards the positive.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Gender, Nation, Race, Racism, Sex, Sexual & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}9/483 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.863 \\  \hline

Furthermore if you think our Marines said fk it and layed down their arms and we would face no consequences youre very nieve. This is the whole problem with liberal think tanks.

I dont have a problem with anyone supporting blacks but they shouldnt throw their own under the bus while doing so unless its a clear cut case in which they should be. Like when Ben Shapiro says "hey let me know about injustice and i will fight it with you" Thats more like the REALITY of 2019. All this other shite is DRAMA and politically motivated power grabs.

We also have military courts ,unlike most of the enemy, that is very strict and not like civilian courts with all those rights so you best believe when a soldier shoots to kill he/she makes sure its a immediate threat and legal.

You speak of being part native American yet want everyone to believe that whites had things the worst and continue to get the short end of the stick. Reality seems to have not awaken you yet. People filled with so much hate and anger can only do one thing - spread hate and anger. You like many people in this country have been brain washed into believing the color of one's skin is of importance. It's propaganda, put in place to get the ignorant riled up and that everyone is out to get you the white \textbf{race}. We know what white privilege looks like because its been televised and we see it on a reg basis put out there to create animosity and spread the truth which is hate does exists. Why was the BIE put out? Ask yourself the true reasoning for it? Do you know? I don't either. What I do know is if people keep letting this happen it will continue to divide the \textbf{nation} and leave us at risk for being attacked and taken over from another country. We need to cut this bullshit and find a way to treat it. I don't believe we can stop it but we can treat it. Learn to love more. You spoke of being accepted in the GD gang which was predominantly \textbf{black} yet you speak of how they treated whites. So what you're saying is there was love for them until one day you just said enough is enough? Sounds like something did not go your way and you turned hateful towards them. If they beat up whites and did everything you said they did then you would've been getting your ass stomped from the beginning and not been part of the gang. Your story doesn't seem to add up. Seems like you knew people in the group but i doubt you were part of that organization. If you were and stood around watching them hurt innocent white people then that would make you a coward and a fraud. I have friends of all colors and would never let any one of them hurt the next based on the color of their skin. Sounds like BS Mr. Fye.

The history of violence towards blacks has been ongoing for centuries. Our citizens have been taught to believe \textbf{racism} is the issue in this country. The issue's bigger than \textbf{racism}. \textbf{Racism} was created to divide and make a \textbf{race} feel superior or inferior. It is propaganda at its finest. Let the ignorant fight the ignorant and divide. What this marine is doing is not extreme. It is like many countrymen believe, that our second amendment right is to bare arms and he must teach his family and community how to protect themselves against attacks that have been happening for centuries. You seem to be taking this personal without understanding the struggles that are happening in this country. The \textbf{black} panther organization was not white hating. They had voluntary whites within the organization. They did not hunt down and hang white people. The KKK did though. They were not hunted down in their beds and killed by the police for doing that. Do you not seem to see the big picture. Propaganda has clouded people's minds including yours. Take some time before replying and think if this could possibly be clouding your mind. You most likely have not lived the life of the less fortunate due to skin color. Maybe due to having less fortunate parents but not skin color.

Incidents that are apparently separated can actually be related through internet communications and relations.  Just because one person wasn't in the same state or because they didn't have the same exact views as the other person, does not mean that they are separate.  What a terrible argument from someone who works at NYU, a supposedly good high ranking school.  Oh, and to say that this is similar to government efforts to intervene in the civil rights era is a gross misrepresentation of what's actually happening, and clear \textbf{race} baiting.  It also aides to the conspiracy theories that BIE tend to promote.  BIE are not different than White Nationalist extremists.  They commit similar acts of violence against the state, and should be categorized similarly.  Finally, Vice's attempt to show police interference with that last little provocative interview at the park with rifles,  was not caused by their \textbf{race}.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small So I hate guns, they make me fearful and I hate seeing them in public, I would prefer if we banned carrying guns in public altogether. I grew up hearing about mass shootings so often especially 2010-now, when I lived in Arizona, I was not far the 2011 Tuscon shootings and was always scared of being shot after that, kind of caused me to develop Agoraphobia. But as guns are apart of life in the US, people even carry them in toy stores (I'm not even joking, saw that the other day, wtf) and your legally allowed to carry, I think it's smart that these men are using that to their advantage and using it as a form of protest. I hope it causes changes, hopefully raising awareness of police brutality, \textbf{black} lives matter, etc. However, I am concerned after seeing how the officers approached the men (which is not typical for how they treat white people) that their protest could cause more harm, and lead to more unjust shootings of \textbf{black} people. Another way I could see this turning out is White People‚Ñ¢ getting threatened by \textbf{black} people carrying guns and getting less pro the second amendment, so we can finally get some safe gun legislation in this country.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Jozef J I have personally been to the US embassy in Trinidad at 6:00 am in the morning and witnessed people lining up for blocks to get a tourist visa into the US.  Many of these people have every intention of working in the US under the table and many will stay permanently if they are able.  Trinidad by global standards  actually has a high standard of living with a solid oil producing base.  And yet people leave there at a very steady pace to come to the US.

On both sides of my \textbf{African} family there was polygamy (8‚Äì10 wives) and the \textbf{transition} to monogamy (colonial influence) wasn't smooth, but what has helped is also the colonialist Christianity.  If you adopt the colonialist method halfway it doesn't work.  It had to be full Christianity with no mixing of traditional religion.  Frankly, Christianity is better, bc the traditional religion is anxiety ridden and I've seen how it creates paranoia and distrust.  Also, on one side Christianity put a stop to female genital mutilation which was a rite of passage.  A lot of \textbf{African} Americans want to shake of the 'white man's' religion, but we are not missing anything really.  Anyway, my point is there needs to be a unified purpose and mutual vision to sustain a marriage and family.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small We (the \textbf{black} community) since much earlier than the KKK was formed have been being abused, controlled, and killed by our white counterparts solely because we don't look the same. People want to shame us for focusing on the past 500+ years of OUR history, but it is pretty much etched into our minds because even at school, public school where we learn about all cultures, the only bit of history our great educational system thinks is important enough to teach young children is about our slavery and killings carried out by people of the SAME \textbf{race}  (THE HUMAN \textbf{RACE}) but with just a lot less melanin than us (Yes, think back to your history books. We learned about the KKK in like the 4th grade and never skipped a year up until high school). Maybe my guy a little higher in the comments shouldn't have used the word "lynching" to speak about the countless murders that have happened, and will continue to happen until we are able to police our own communities. I mean, how are we supposed to be protected when the same people policing our communities are the ones who are afraid of  us because of our skin color and the way that some of us speak?... or even just the fkn cloths we wear, I mean c'mon. The only way for us to feel  and actually BE safe is to exercise our rights which this beautiful country bestowed upon us, at least before they are all taken away because of whatever changes the higher ups deem necessary. Just look at the broader picture for this video: Americans are being called terrorists for organizing marches and teaching their community about why we should be and stay armed. This has been happening forever on the whiter side of things, but since some \textbf{black}, non-felon, nonviolent Americans decided to wake up and exercise their rights it's become a matter of Homeland Security... as if we flaunt "Come And Take It" flags on our front porches and rage about standing our ground. This planet, which we all evolved on,  should be enough of a reason for us to treat everyone fairly, no matter what. Sadly I can't go back in time and stop the fear mongering and hatred from starting in the first place, but if only 10 of the planet started to wake up to what we have become it would make a mountain of a difference compared to us being filled with the negativity that's been driving us for millennia.

Hope you guys get a clue.Ps. I am a college student and was raised by two Navy parents. I shouldn't have to have had a vast majority of my childhood without my parents because they were fighting in foreign wars for oil, especially if when they retired they would have to worry about being called a \textbf{terrorist} for having a certain political view. Rather than fighting the battles we have going at our own home turf the gov't would rather spend multiple billions annually on oil wars rather than spend a few billion fixing the communities they never gave a chance. I wasn't raised in the hood but i did have to stay with cousins and grandparents who didn't have the best upbringing, so i got to experience what they lived like, but it only ever lasted a year at a time max. I understand people saying to just "do better" but it's a lot harder than it seems. Especially since employers discriminate based on how names sound and what not.

The more exaggerations are made in the name of proving a point the less your point is valid. Travon Martin was not a lynching in any way shape or form.  The fact that you guys are claiming so shows me that you are desperate to find examples to fit your narrative that isn't true.  If a \textbf{black} person was drug in the streets and hung up and lynched in a tree by a bunch of white people it would literally make the world news.  We would talk about it non stop and the "Government" that you hate so much would prosecute the perpetrators.  Your feelings aren't facts.  So sad that most blacks today are actually more similar to white people in the 1800s then white people today.  The only people where it's socially acceptable to be a \textbf{racist} bigot are blacks in today environment. Yet they believe they are more oppressed now then their ancestors who were slaves.  Doesn't make sense.  Everybody is \textbf{racist} that's why we had a \textbf{black} president last term?  Everybody is \textbf{racist} that's why white people worship \textbf{black} people in sports, music, and culture?  Everybody is \textbf{racist} that's why the vast majority of white children this generation have interracial marriage?  Everybody is \textbf{racist} that's why \textbf{black} people are the fastest growing economic demographic in America right now?  \textbf{Racism} still exists i'm not ignorant enough to think it doesn't....but don't tell me that America is more \textbf{racist} and shitty than other countries.  Don't tell me that blacks can't be \textbf{racist} too get the fuck outta here.  \textbf{Racism} is and always will be part of human nature....it's tribalism.  Doesn't mean we haven't improved a shit ton from our past and doesn't mean we won't significantly improve in the future.  However the 'us vs them' and 'I'm a victim' attitude will only keep a further divide and perpetuate the very thing you fear.  If you treat me like a \textbf{racist} everyday...you tell me i'm \textbf{racist} everyday...I give you my hand in peace and you slap it down....you demean me and my culture....you make up stories that aren't factual or 100 true....you reject me on the basis of my skin color and tell me it's not \textbf{racism}....you want further conflict and no peace....then what you get in return is someone just like you.......a \textbf{racist}.  Stop using a past as a reason to be angry now.  Because your anger now will be a reason for whites to be angry with you in the future.  And the cycle goes on and on.  And trust me....white people will only take so much shit....you think whites are really being \textbf{racist} to you?  You think things are bad now?  Trust me my friend they aren't.....and if provoked enough and the divide continues whites may go back to being true racists....the very thing you've never seen and have no idea of how bad things could be.

So your right about that . It's entirely possible a suicide could of been something more dark and evil. That why I hope all Americans realize we need to stick together. I've been getting censored by YouTube by reaching out to my neighbors and getting to know them and then the censorship started. That's might sound \textbf{crazy} but it's true. It happened tonight. I just want to tell everyone don't trust these companies Youtube and Google especially if your \textbf{black} and I'm saying this as a concern citizen that happens to be white because the \textbf{black} community knows as well as I do that blacks are targeted unfairly by law enforcement and and receive longer sentences for identical crimes. There are whole studies on this and Joe Rogan has an attorney on to talk about unfair sentencing. Anyone who reads this should watch it before Youtube censors that too. I want everyone to know that I'm 33 now and I've decided to turn back to God because the American culture I followed in my Youth led to incarceration for me unfortunately. When I say American culture I'm talking about the leftist ideology. It poisoned my mind and convinced me to Turn from God. I'm glad I finally woke up. Another piece advice I would offer my fellow \textbf{black} Americans is to be weary of anyone who's job it is to take away your freedom and put you in a cage. They say laws protect us. But not if you are the intended target of those laws. We need to be allies in this coming struggle of people who hide in the dark and want to take Americans freedom of speech and our 2nd amendments. Everyone always remember the people hold the power and the more people you have the more power you have Americans of all races need to stick together. These big tech companies are starting to censor our speech. I worry about the future generation of Americans and how these big tech companies could manipulate society and events just by censoring your speech or omitting certain parts of your speech. I often wonder if that Jussie Smollet  would of pulled off his plan which I hope no one buys for a second that was only his idea. With all the social media attention and Press coverage it was insane! And before that you had the Covington kid from Kentucky and they made it look like some kind of important spectacle because a kid was smirking??? I'm not saying these are false events what I'm saying is the Mass media use these events to cause a scene they are the provocateurs of all the division we see. Just please if you ever one these big tech companies services or apps and some seems to be turning you against your own citizens??? I would be suspicious. If they turn Americans against each other and it gets too ugly and deadly the president can institute Marshal law and then that constitution becomes \textbf{nothing} more than a flimsy paper and the military starts acting as the policeman and will may even try and take our 2nd amendment from all of us to under Marshal law. Don't ever think the public is against you because the only way that happens is if they manipulate it to happen. I totally agree about the police They are not the public and there job is to enforce laws on us. Anytime you see a fellow citizen being questioned by cops if you feel brave enough record a video of if possible. That's how you help your neighbors and fellow citizens. We can't let them keep dividing us. And please do not fall for any of the \textbf{Race} baiting the Press pushes on is daily. I think they realize cable is dying and they are doing and finding what ever gets outrageous to get everyone to watch. What better way to get peoples attention than to push racial tension???

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Kyle, In almost all the open carry videos I have seen the officer approaches the person in question without their guns drawn, and in most videos it is a single officer maybe two not the at least half dozen in this video. Even with two or three men, sitting peacefully at a table the response was not proportionate especially for a state that promotes itself as open carry and freedom loving. AND, referencing the uniform crime statistics by \textbf{race} chart is a not so subtle call out to the \textbf{common} talking point about crime and \textbf{race}, not to mention specifically calling out \textbf{race} as a factor and using that to disprove a completely opposite assertion. Also in most other videos the person carrying was not asked to surrender their weapon for inspection. To me it is not about whether or not they were stopped or approached but the tact that was used during that stop or approach. Let me also mention that in most open carry confrontation videos I have seen that subject of the stop was uncooperative at best and belligerent at worst provoking the officer in ways that these guys did not and through experience would not dare do.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Common, Race & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}4/201 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.99 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small As they should. Like I replied to Kyle my issue was not with the cops being called but with the disproportional responses as to their number and the fact that the men were asked to surrender their weapons for inspection. Bias is subtle and it shades how we approach each other in ways that are often not easy to spot. I am not anti police, not one bit, I rely on them like everyone else to protect and serve, but police are people and subject to the same biases the rest of us hold. I also believe that many officers are not aware of their own biases and some smaller proportion actually hold views that contradict their mandate. My goal was not to call anyone \textbf{racist} but to point out where the law and preconceived notions of people by appearance factor into encounters like this. It is obvious to me that these men at one time all had "The talk" and that saddens me.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/164 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.61 \\  \hline

Watch how they treat Patriot Militias, Gun Owners in America vs how they treat \& support the \textbf{Terrorist} loving \textbf{Black} Extremists. Cant be proud \& white... but you can be proud \& \textbf{black}... seriously? How they portray Cops vs BLM, Lefty Orgs. Look at the titles. Multiple ex-employees have talked about the radical leftists within the company \& how the culture has completely changed. Some vids are worse than others. They label all white people Alt Right or \textbf{Racist}, for wanting America to remain America. No hate involved in that... just fighting the radical left. The jack ass who said only terrorists in America are white is a complete sperg. Terror \& Evil has been committed by all ethnicities in America but some shouldn't have even been here. FBI didn't do their job on others (Cruz - not white). Some had strange backgrounds \& cover-ups (Vegas). Draw Mohamed Shootout in TX (Muslim). \textbf{Black} dude decapitated his co-worker. \textbf{Immigrant} crime, Chicago, Drug Mules/Dealers, Rape Gangs plus all the foiled attempts... all whites? Nope, a few were white. Stop watching CNN \& wake up. Look who runs the companies plus the ADL, SPLC etc... the Alinsky game plan and marching orders come from there. Divide and Conquer.Frankly, don't really care. Life is great, I'm prospering, so is America. We are trending in the right direction, about to get the Kav in SCOTUS,  MAGA Rond 2 will be awesome \& hopefully secure the border or get the wall, deport recent arrivals, change dual citizenship laws, secure voting for Americans, etc. I am proud of who I am, where I come from \& what we have accomplished throughout history \& building the modern world.

What does keeping a low profile after being released on BS charges have to do with protecting ones self and family? You keep a low profile when you've done something wrong, and possibly plan to continue doing wrong. Even a person that deserved to be incarcerated but has paid their debt to society should also have \textbf{nothing} to fear from honest law enforcement.He's a patriot. He's a citizen. Why should he fear his government? The government he served as a U.S. Marine.The society is civil Andy just, or it isn't. Either way, the social exist by intent. No organized society exists by happenstance.If more people like him, white, \textbf{Black}, everyone would be unified and more critical of the government, and realize that the left wing and the right wing belong to the same vulture, maybe the government would fear We The People. Unfortunately, this vulture is in the pocket of the mega wealthy. The mega wealthy that control economics, political, and the culture. We the people are divided and conquered through \textbf{racism}, economic and political exploitation, and for profit militarism.
