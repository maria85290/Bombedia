Second of all, to the Boomers who always criticize younger generations, your generation wasn't perfect either, you were born after World War Two and a seemingly good, easy world. Now I'm not going to pretend that your lives were easy or perfect, but Mother Earth had a lot less problems then than now, so anyways I'm with the story. Baby boomers then decided that taxes were stupid and basically you brought the \textbf{nation} into outstanding debt almost single handedly, then when the reports and evidence of climate change came though, y'all didn't care! Factories were making YOU money and stuff YOU wanted. So instead of fixing your mistake, you dumped all that sh*t on the younger generations to try and clean up. But wait! There's more! A majority of the government is influenced by mostly boomers, who seem to oppose change, and also boomers don't exactly support \textbf{mental} health.So yes, I'm sorry your jealous Boomers, but think about all of the things you had, and took away from us when you were the majority.p.s (this is the majority of the boomers, but certainly not every boomer ever)\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Mental, Nation & \cellcolor{green!27}Nationality - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}2/248 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.806 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small This entire "debate" is based off of stereotypical instances, and at the most, is trivial. Just because technology has advanced doesn't mean we have to continue using the obsolete devices of the past. The only advantage an \textbf{old} analog television will provide over an HD unit is the feeling of nostalgia, and that only applies to a certain amount of people. All of these are a result of time; how do you think older generations felt in the 1950's, when the television exploded in popularity and became internationally known? If you're into the older pop culture and devices, good for you. But don't judge others for enjoying something that wasn't in your childhood.EDIT: If you're young and enjoy something of the past generations, no need to shame your peers who don't.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small So this is a \textbf{common} but over used trope at the moment so we're going to break this down a bit. 1. The difference between how 13yr olds dress now vs 10 or 20 years ago can be explained through the sexualisation of minors that our media (owned by straight \textbf{old} white men) pushes. Now children are being told they need to look good or a certain way instead of being allowed to be kids. This is intentional and it's large scale grooming of young girls (afab people). Don't blame them, blame creepy adults. 2. Children using technology instead of toys is not their fault. A child doesn't just get an iPad or tablet from no where. The parent made the decision to give them one and to just put them in front of it day in day out. My neice do3snt have a tablet. She has toys. She gets to watch some tv after school if she's been good. But mostly she plays with her toys and makes up games. Don't blame or mock the child. Look to education parents to do better by their children. 3. Younger people on their phones doesn't make them ignorant or stupid. I can't text and message people on my phone. I check in with my \textbf{disabled} mother when out. I can check bus schedules as well as my bank balance all from my phone. I can check the news too and get live updates online. I do a lot of work from my phone and most of the time young people can carry out maybe 3+ conversations on their phone plus real life interactions. Stop assuming that phones make young people \textbf{dumb} when it's been proven to do the opposite. 4. \textbf{Old} fashioned news papers and such are not better than online/technology. We currently have a climate emergency. The productions of news papers and such does not help with this at all. It's also always big corporate businesses and puppets for billionaires who publish/write in these papers where as online anyone can do it meaning that fair and independent news is possible.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Common, Disabled, Dumb, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}5/350 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.429 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small As a 14 year \textbf{old}, I understand that times have changed. Technology has improved considerably and there are new trends that have changed the world greatly too. But I disagree with some of these as some of them are really over exaggerated. Like the WiFi on the restaurant. That is just a hoax. All we need is for parents to enforce rules for their children.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small at times like these, i feel like i was born in the wrong generation. yeah, i go on my phone constantly. but that appears to be the only thing keeping me in this generation. maybe its because i'm more educated because i grew up with cousins who were born in the 80s. maybe its because i grew up in a leaning-more-towards-poor household and we didn't have electronics like ipads until we were 9. or maybe its just because we got a lot of hand me downs from my older cousins. i don't know but i don't belong in this generation and i feel judged for not dressing up like an 18 year \textbf{old} when i'm 15.edit: oh my god that 16 year \textbf{old} didn't know what the rugrats was? 3 years ago my entire science class of 12 - 13 year olds got excited at the mention of watching an episode of rugrats and we all got into a nostalgic mood. maybe its just my country or city that's like this. or maybe i am right and its just lack of education.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}2/183 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.093 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Aysu H. I do it. I do many things with my friends and other people and away from the phone.And I am very happy for the time I spend with my friends when I was 11. I can't remember what I watched on TV, I didn't own a phone or a computer, but I remember what I did with my friends. Right now I don't have school anymore and many friends aren't there so I spend more time with my phone, but honestly, I can't remember half of the things I watched on YouTube (or at least I don't think at it), but I can remember every minute I spend with other people.In 10 years, what do you want to tell others what you did this time? "Just chillin' around" or do you want to tell them exiting stories about what you experienced? Sorry for my long reply, but I believe that spending too much time before the screen on a too young \textbf{age} isn't good for the people. I can understand spending some time on the phone, but that doesn't make you happy, maybe in the moment you are doing that, but not for life. And young people have a better opportunity to spend time with their friends because they usually have more free time, they should use that time\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/223 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.448 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small This is what i used to do as a kid. This is going to be long scroll away if you dont want to waste your time.I was born on 2001 and as a kid i mostly had those 90s things. I had both a dvd player and a vhs player ( whenever i see a vhs i remove those tape things inside and play around with them ), my dad gave me one of the portable disk mp3 players ( I broke it when i was 4 )i had a 'phone' when i was 5 it was a \textbf{old} nokia phone but it never worked. I used to play snake and this certain game where you bounce on clouds ( idk whats its name tbh ) on my mums phone. I used to play on a ps1 when i was 5 then it had got spoiled so my dad got me a ps2 when i was 7 ( i still have the ps2 and it works ) as a kid i really loved to play with sand when my family and i go to the beach and i loved crayons. I played a lot of football ( soccer ) and i used to ride my bike with my friends every day ! Oh and finally i loved toys like legos, hotwheels, ( any car toy, just give me one and ill play with it ).Now i just stare at my phone the whole day, play ps4 most of the times and just study !\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}1/256 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.391 \\  \hline
