  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I'm glad this stuff comes up more and more so people get aware of this, by the way where I live which is Germany, that is most likely to be ridiculed by men not women. What I often don't like about it, is the way it is played out in a competitive way against womens rights rather than fighting on the same side (also applies to all the so called 'Feminists' who turned the definition of Feminism on it's head). By the way, the women and children first thing, yeah it was basically proven by many witnesses to not be a thing in reality, once there is a catastrophy brains go into survival mode, and many brains go me first. Since men are mostly stronger, women and children don't stand a chance. That's why it was brought up I guess. I call myself a feminist (more the \textbf{old} style way), but I would never say women are capable of everything. I'm a very small women and very \textbf{lightweight}. I know that my body is not able to do certain things. That's why I cannot be a pilot, go to miltary, police or other forces, firewomen all not possible, even though my mindset and other skills would be fitting. And I for sure don't call this discrimination. But if you're a women that can take on the physical challanges, it shouldn't be a thing to be allowed to do it without stupid remarks. Just as a caring man shouldn't be ridiculed if he want's to work in a kindergarten or care for \textbf{old} people.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Lightweight, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}3/263 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.141 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small This is true. I have tried saying at school to my friends about other sexist things against men, and how girls at school (the majority, there are a few girls who see both types of \textbf{sexism}) think they can do anything they want.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Yeah, no feminist denies that \textbf{sexism} against men isn't a thing; it's fucking easy to disprove that so way to set such a low bar for yourself. Feminists, however, mainly focus on women's issue but that doesn't mean men's problems are left out in the dark. Good job completely misconstruing the feminist standpoint.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Yo okay, so I'm just seeing this now but thought I'd reply 3 months late anyway.I'm not gonna deny that the bulk of feminists focus on women's rights; it's absolutely true. But you have to understand the different dynamics that play into \textbf{sexism}, one main one being that it's generally women who are held back by \textbf{sexism} and it's usually more "feminine"  traits that are looked down upon. It does effect men; I don't think any feminist denies that. When you or TJ say that feminists think that no man suffers from \textbf{sexism}, that's just grasping at straws instead of trying to actually refute and combat a lot of feminist arguments, generally held by most feminists (and being that "men don't suffer from \textbf{sexism}" isn't really a widely held feminist belief, it's kind of pointless to point fingers at feminists for thinking this very disputable idea). Also, something I want you to understand is that wanting equal rights doesn't just stop when legally, people are equal under the law. The truth is that when a society or culture has seen a group of people in certain lights, that doesn't just go away once they're legally equal.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}4/197 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.03 \\  \hline

And \textbf{woman} always say that men are animals, and dogs, because \textbf{woman} think that men are fucking shits with no feelings.

Last, in P.E, girls would always be loud in the locker, room, and people won't do shit. Once, we were making noise in there, and we had to run a lap in less that 1:30, and our field is pretty big. We literally run 3 laps, and that is a mile. If we didn't do it in that time, we would have to do 30 sit ups, and 30 push ups, and after we had to do an exercise of 20 jumping jacks, 15 seconds of leg stretchers on each side, 15 seconds of paper clips on each side, and 15 seconds of flamingo on each foot, and the girls were like, c'mon boys!!! 🤣😂HAHAHAHA!!! 💀I will kill you☠️\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}5/224 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.232 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I completely agree with this video, except now \textbf{sexism} is MOSTLY against men. Sure, in the past, it was against women. I'm not saying that's a good thing, but unacceptable \textbf{sexism} against women is better than accepted \textbf{sexism} against men. What I'm trying to say is that \textbf{sexism} against women is now socially unacceptable, which is good. They achieved equality. But now I'd say about half of women want superiority. If you don't agree with me just listen to this ridiculous but true law: If a women hurts a male it is perfectly fine, legal, no big deal. If a man hurts a female (even if it is for self defense!) it is illegal and he will most likely not be accepted into society anymore. If a man or a women punch a 6 year \textbf{old} boy it is legal. That law basically states that women are more sensitive than 6 year \textbf{old} boys. And some people say this is because women are physically weaker. That is considered sexist. Well, if women aren't physically weaker, that law has no logic at all. It is the same as \textbf{racism}. If a women needs help, she will get help. If a man needs help, he will be considered weak unless he gets out of the situation without help. The way I see it, mother nature gave women the advantage because making them slightly physically weaker (no offense) gives feminists a reason to create these ridiculous laws acceptable things in society.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Old, Racism, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}7/248 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.823 \\  \hline

Evolutionary instincts in most humans to place women first ontop of women's  hypergamy, feminisms self centered behavior and their ability to sleep with the government for funds and legislation in their favor while their "oppressors" are away at work.. We don't need feminism we need humanism the only reason we do need mens rights awareness groups is just to simply bring a balance to the damage modern feminism has brought but if feminism ends tomorrow you won't see any mens rights groups feeling the need to continue\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Patriarchy & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/159 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.629 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Okay, first of all, I totally agree with you. Male \textbf{sexism} does exist. But throughout the whole part where you talked about the titanic, I was confused. The reason women and children go first is because women can produce more children, which leads to a larger population ( at the time, population wasn't as much of a problem ) and children because they have a longer life to live making goods or whatever. The men stayed behind or went last because they are to have a shorter life ahead of them, since you know their older. They won't be able to do as much as a child would do. Otherwise, good video, keep it up.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/115 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.87 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I don't mean to be a bother or anything, but with the breast cancer vs prostate cancer debate I think I have a little input. First off, it's all horrible and should have proportional representation in medical research, media coverage, ect. but I do believe that the second factor about that debacle is (I could be totally wrong) that prostate cancer is far more prevalent in \textbf{elderly} men opposed to young-middle aged men. So it affects less young men, while breast cancer affects people at an evenly distributed rate. I could be wrong on that, but that's where I believe some of the difference lies. While they may take similar lives, one may steal more years per life on average. Plus, everyone loves thinking about helping some woman's breasts, and not some dude's prostate.

Even in China, males are expected to pay for all the females in their family while the women can work and get to keep all the money they make.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Melon Lord Thing is the hijab isn't about being pretty. It's modesty to an absurd extreme; the idea that men aren't capable of seeing a \textbf{woman}'s personality unless their body is covered up. The idea that men are incapable of controlling their urges when they see a \textbf{woman}. And I don't know about you, but the sight of Muslim women covered from head to toe, while the guy with them has shorts and a short sleeve shirt doesn't give me the warm fuzzies in the slightest. I'm not speaking as a feminist, I'm just speaking as a human being. The only positive to come out of this is I'm starting to see hijabs made by Coach, lol.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@TheaterPup I know exactly what the hijab is meant for, but it does have its side effects. Women should have the CHOICE to wear or not to wear it, at least a free choice protected by law. Seeing a \textbf{woman} covered head to toe wearing shorts and short sleeves to me is like seeing me next to a \textbf{woman} who is wearing something more revealing than a bikini whilst I am wearing full khaki trousers and button-up long-sleeve shirt on a hot day because I have to go to work. As long as it is a choice, it is fine by me, and if it isn't a choice, then I stop giving a fuck and go about my day.I mean, there is SOME merit in what I said about them looking pretty, considering a number of Muslim women want to wear Hijabs BECAUSE they look good (again, primarily Iranian and \textbf{Indian} ones).

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Melon Lord You're basically defending their right to oppress, and suppress, themselves. It's a choice, but not one to be proud of. We'll have to agree to disagree on that one. You can find it attractive but that doesn't mean you turn a \textbf{blind} eye to its meaning.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@TheaterPup  When it is only worn by choice, it loses its meaning. To someone who wears it by choice, that's the meaning it has. Think of a gun for example. Do guns symbolize freedom, or violence? Or does the gun owner choose for himself what his gun symbolizes? Does he own the gun because he wants to hurt people, like a \textbf{common} liberal stereotype, or does he own a gun to exercise a constitutional right (assume we are in America here)? Same, does an individual \textbf{woman} wear a hijab to appease a superior male figure, or does she wear a hijab to look modest in her OWN desire (or in my example does she wear the hijab because it is in itself a form of fashion and culture)? Guns are designed to be fired, that's their purpose. A hijab is designed to cover a human body, that's its purpose. What they symbolize is subjective. Just as the firing of a gun doesn't necessarily kill someone (if I fire a gun in a shooting range, I hurt \textbf{nobody}), wearing a hijab does not necessarily make the wearer oppressed.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Common, Nobody, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Gender - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}3/187 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.604 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@TheaterPup If a \textbf{woman} imposes her beliefs on other women then it is immoral. If the \textbf{woman} keeps her beliefs to herself, then that's fine. Also what's the double standard here? I personally don't like my legs showing, and I am a guy, so I choose to wear long trousers. Plenty of women don't like exposing too much skin, and will wear what they see fit. A double standard would be a Muslim \textbf{woman} preaching Women's freedom and then complaining that Western women don't wear Hijabs. THAT is a double standard, and THAT can be shamed. The standard run-of-the-mill Muslim \textbf{woman} that walks down the street with her purse over her shoulder is not doing anything.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}4/116 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.448 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Melon Lord The double standard is that women have to cover up so as not to tempt men, but men don't have to do the same to their own bodies. It paints women as objects that tempt men, and though it's their own fault. And it paints men as being unable to control themselves. It's primitive and degrading to both genders.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@TheaterPup That's the political and religious institution of the hijab. A \textbf{woman} who wears it for the sake of wearing it does not exhibit that double standard (though she may think it). Especially when you look in pluralistic societies like Muslim Americans, Muslim Turks, Muslim Indians, and Muslim Chinese (China is more pluralistic than Arabia and Iran, for the sake of argument), most women don't particularly care, though they will get irritated if a man ogles them. Most women do. Everyone has what they are comfortable wearing. Your argument is like someone would give to an arachnophobia: that spiders are harmless (in this case, the human body is natural, \textbf{sex} is natural, and \textbf{sexual} attraction is natural, all truths), and that anybody who feels uncomfortable or afraid should be ashamed that they are (basically people who are self conscious, not wanting others to lust them, or not wanting to get harassed for undesirable looks i.e obesity, acne, scars, etc.).I mean, you have a valid concern. Just that it is targeted at the wrong people. Aim it at fundamentalist Muslims and Muslim feminists who demand that their ideas are the best and be spread to everyone else. Not to mention that, in my experience, there is the matter of a \textbf{woman} choosing to wear very skimpy clothing, but becoming very aggressive if anyone ogles her (it actually isn't controllable; men will check out a fine ass if they see one, as will women, and just because it is uncontrollable doesn't make it wrong, since they have not harmed anyone).\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Sex, Sexual, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}4/259 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.544 \\  \hline

It was often done without anesthesia, due to the absurd opinion that the babies won't feel a thing.Female genital mutilation is outlawed all over the western world and beyond. Male circumcision on the other hand is not even an issue for most people. \textbf{Sexism} is one of the reasons for that - but there's \textbf{sexism} against men in many fields.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Redrosewitch By \textbf{common} definition you are absolutely right. I have actually invested in this a bit and took a course on the Philosophy of Feminism and I got a lot of these things explained by the Feminists that have devoted their lives to applying reasoning to this.When the Feminists say "\textbf{sexism}", they are referring to a technical definition. To put this in perspective, "pull" means a very different thing in political terms than it does when you and I use it everyday. We aren't agreeing on our terms when we engage and when we do we bicker about the word. It looks to be that we are fighting over exclusive rights to a buzzword because it is critical if you are going to smuggle in syllogisms.When you define \textbf{sexism} as "hatred of a person based on their \textbf{sex} or \textbf{gender}" then Feminists have to agree or they have to defend a claim that is impossible to make. On Tumblr, there are fewer people who understand the Philosophy itself and only see the privilege of men (Their own is invisible to themselves) and take this "Smarter people than me figured it out" approach that is rooted in practicality and/or laziness. They are usually happy to accept the privilege of their \textbf{race} because frankly in western society it is hammered into us to recognize the history of colonial racial oppression at least superficially.Pull that thread courteously and most of these Tumblr folks will either back off or make a fool of themselves in front of their cohorts who will either try to engage, in which case rinse and repeat or they will claim that you are minimizing them, in which case your coup de grace is to say something to the effect of "Do your concepts and arguments function without use of that word in particular?".

If they thought that breast cancer only effected women, it isn't \textbf{sexism}. It would be comparable to a person thinking that only men or only women can be stimulated anally (and I have met a person that thought only men could be stimulated that way, btw). It's just an anatomical/medical thing that they didn't know.I personally give these people the benefit of the doubt and simply accuse them of being MORONS (rather than sexists).

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Wow...I like most of your videos but this one surprised me. It surprised me because you actually seem to be very passionate about your belief in this. Yes, you can believe whatever you want, but this one surprised me because of your extreme lack of empathy. It's what I see from most straight,white men. (I know that last sentence probably set you off, and it was supposed to, so please hear me out).  It comes off like a spoiled king sitting on his golden throne bemoaning the servants and how they get all the breaks. Male privilege is real, just like white privilege and straight privilege. Yes, people will discriminate against men, but it's disproportionate compared to how many more people discriminate against women, especially on a daily basis. You sound like a white guy getting mad because of all those whiny \textbf{black} people who don't know how hard it is being a white guy and all the discrimination we get. Any reverse discrimination a white guy gets is infinitesimal compared to the actual discrimination a \textbf{black} guy gets ever day of his life. The same can be said for \textbf{g\textbf{ay}} people compared to straight people. It's also the same for women compared to men.You don't know what it's like being a minority (or a \textbf{woman}, who I know make up more of the population so lets not get hung up on semantics), or being ACTUALLY discriminated against. Reverse discrimination is way different then actual discrimination. Women and children first is an archaic argument, BTW, and, if you were being honest, doesn't really affect you in 2015. How do I know what I'm talking about is true? I don't. I just have my life experience. I am a \textbf{g\textbf{ay}}, white male and an Atheist. I understand discrimination all too well in the form of \textbf{homophobia} and it effects me almost every day of my life, in big ways and small ways. I know what it's like to be discriminated against because of being \textbf{g\textbf{ay}}, but, amusingly, I also know what it's like to be discriminated against because of being straight. You see, I "pass" as straight, and most, if not all, people assume I'm straight. So, very rarely, a case will come up where it seems like I'm being discriminated against because I'm straight. I can also tell you, those scenarios occur rarely, if ever. However, I can tell you I experience \textbf{homophobia} almost everyday of my life, and sometimes it's so bad, that it's almost crippling. If you are truly being honest with yourself, you'd understand that women are women everyday of their lives. \textbf{Sexism} and discrimination are a very real part of their lives that they live with EVERYDAY. You come off as pretty arrogant.  You think you know what it's like being a \textbf{woman} in this society? You think it's not that bad and men get it just the same? Tell that to women forced to wear burkas and not allowed to leave their homes. Tell that to the girls who are murdered in the Middle East because they are trying to go to school. Tell that to the women in our country who still get paid \$.75 to every dollar a man makes. Tell it to the girls suffering from the crippling eating disorders because every magazine, movie, and t.v. show tells them they are too \textbf{fat}. Tell that to the thousands and thousands of women who have been raped and are afraid to ever leave their homes alone for fear of violence against them.This video of yours comes off at the very least, unsympathetic and at the worst, extremely misogynistic.

It was fighting to make the rights of females equal to those of men. when the movement restarted, it started with the same intentions as the original, but then the actions of the few converted the many and the whole thing spiraled out of control. To fight for one side or the other is not whats needed in order for changes to be made. we need \textbf{gender} equality on both sides. By male genital mutilation do you mean circumcision?

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Honestly, the world has taken a turn for the worst. The problem is, what 'feminists' don't realise is that they are NOT preaching equality. The word "Feminist," literally means someone who supports or sympathises with the natural behaviour of women. BIOLOGICALLY, women are built to be less dominant, more sympathetic and more diligent, in the sense that they are better with organisation and managing things, therefore so this is can be seen as the NATURAL BEHAVIOUR OF WOMEN. However our society has changed in recent years, so that now men and women share the same RIGHTS to the most reasonable extent, which is great, I cannot deny. Having equal rights is one thing however, but denying natural human biology is another. In the eyes of modern day 'equality,' I have the right to be a part of any club I want, and no one can deny me acceptance into the club. I also have a right to attend any school or university I want, so I don't have to be a girl to go to an all girls school because we're all have the right to be a part of anything we like, don't we? The problem is, you can only go so far as to provide people with equal rights. However, the \textbf{common} misconception is that equal means "the same." This is entirely false. Equal means "even," or "level." No body on this earth is the same, but the biggest physical division between people is by \textbf{gender}. By this I mean that there are a lot of differences between men and women. Does this mean that naturally the two genders despise each other? No. It simply means you can't compare a man to a women because they are both built very differently. Why then do we all act as if men and women should perform the same roles, and be subject to the same things. No body thinks of the way people are MEANT to act anymore. The traditional idea of the family is fading, and inevitably the next generation will grow up in a very different and strange way. We are only contributing to this problem. And the problem is that we are not recognising the things that NEED to be changed, we are creating illusions of these problems that don't exist.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Common, Gender & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}2/384 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.521 \\  \hline

Sorry, but where is the evidence that women cannot act dominant according just to their bodies? Where is the evidence that they shouldn't have the same roles as men? The only and I mean THE ONLY thing that should differ women from men are their primary and secondary \textbf{sex} organs. For anything else there are exceptions, therefor it cannot be a legit rule. Actually, even for the \textbf{sex} organs there are exceptions. But what I mean is, a womans mind doesn't work different then a mans. Only because it's the norm that women do that and men do that doesn't say it is the right or the only thing to do.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@MrElionorWow... you really do not get it. Ok, but first things first. If you want people to get your point then please keep it below 67 words per sentence.You're actually invalidating your own argument. Why don't men solve the problem of discrimination against men? Because there are lots of assholes out there that think that men have to (and can) solve all their problems on their own. They might even compare all men to Mike Tyson who of course should not start crying and go to his mother to complain about how unfair the world is.Just odd that this does not seem to apply for women. Why do men have to solve their own problems but women should get all support of the whole of society? They certainly are big girls that can handle it themselves.Just by the way... how the fuck do you come to the conclusion that men are the most privileged "class" of society? Women got a longer lifespan than men and in medicine most research funds that are spent for \textbf{gender} specific fields benefit women - not men. On the other hand the draft only forces men to go to the army in most countries. Oh yeah - what a privilege to die for your country or to simply waste months or years of your life.It's just not that simple. The people on the very top of society might most often be men, but the people at the very bottom are often usually men too. Look at homeless people for example. Society does not seem to regard men as beings that need protection. But EVERYONE can get into a situation in which you need help.So... why exactly should women not help me to solve my problems? I didn't say they should solve ALL my problems or that I should rely solely on them. I simply think that people should solve the problems of people and society should help to solve the problems of its members. Why should women only focus on the problems of women or men only focus on the problems of men? Inequalities are inequalities, no matter who is being harmed. And having a \textbf{woman} speak up for you as a man is not a shame but should be regarded as sth. totally normal, same as a man speaking up for a \textbf{woman} is considered to be normal.And yes: Privileges often go along with responsibilities. But while womens rights activists actively demand equal rights, they pass when it's about the distribution of responsibilities. The result of that can never be true equality.You either treat people equally regardless of their \textbf{gender} or you don't.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@BobTheTrueCactus​Putting aside your sudden problem with my grammar as i said there is no one for men to cry to what's more no one cares that's the draw back of having the most privileges (how do i know that? I look around) and it's selfish and childish to expect someone else what's more someone less fortunate then you to solve your problems women don't sit back saying "fix it for me" why would men expect that? I agree if women were treated as equals it would be unfair to favor women but that's not the case and why do women live longer than men? What's more how would you want to equalize it? And I said they had less benefits not non and believe it or not for some people it is a privilege to serve and die for their country but do you think the draft offers both sexes the this privilege? Why does the draft only take men? It's because for the longest time it was the general consensus that women could only make and raise babies you don't think there were women who wanted to fight? Were they taken seriously? Hell no all they ever heard was "don't worry your pretty little head about it" even now a \textbf{woman} has to work twice as hard to be worth half as much in the army make no mistake the draft is sexist against women not men it's not that hard either women have real problems do you really think it's fair to ask them to stop and kiss your booboos? And what's perhaps most telling is despite your statement that people should solve the problems of people and the society all you have asked in this thread is for women to help men you never said anything about men needing to help women but i guess that's a given right?\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/313 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.319 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Ok, I learned something new today. Women have the chance to join the army if they wish. Men are forced to join it and have to go to prison if they won't. And that's sexist against women. Good to know.The draft is no opportunity. Opportunities are voluntary - and if it was a privilege then you wouldn't put people into prison if they don't want to go.At least in the western world women are not less fortunate than men. That's just nonsense. About the lifespan: Let's just take the example of cancer research. Research of types of cancer that mainly or exclusively affect women (breast and ovary cancer) receive multiple times as much funding as cancer research that mainly benefits men (testicular and prostate cancer). This does not reflect the amount of caused deaths by those types of cancer at all, so maybe this is a field where we could start equalizing a little and basing the funding on the benefit it would cause - not on the \textbf{gender} of the patients. This would automatically decrease the inequalities in this field.And you're putting words in my mouth again. What I said is, society needs to help people that are in need and to erase inequalities. Society includes men and women. So yeah, men and women are responsible to erase inequalities that affect members of society. Both genders suffer from those inequalities, both genders should do sth. about it. Together.You said:"And what's perhaps most telling is despite your statement that people should solve the problems of people and the society all you have asked in this thread is for women to help men you never said anything about men needing to help women but i guess that's a given right?"﻿I actually adressed that in the comment you just replied to:"Why should women only focus on the problems of women or men only focus on the problems of men? Inequalities are inequalities, no matter who is being harmed. And having a \textbf{woman} speak up for you as a man is not a shame but should be regarded as sth. totally normal, same as a man speaking up for a \textbf{woman} is considered to be normal." Support should go both ways.Dude, I'm talking about \textbf{gender} equality all the time. It goes without saying that this counts for both genders.Society has to enforce equal treatment. If somebody is discriminated against because of the \textbf{gender}, then the society should work on fixing this. Society shouldn't help because the person who is being discriminated against is male/female, but because that person is discriminated against due to the \textbf{gender}.

Women aren't drafted because generally they're not physically capable enough to carry all the equipment for long distances.

Nevertheless, the studies suggested that men and women on the whole possess an equal aptitude for math and science."So basically, from 111 studies, the conclusion  was there was \textbf{gender} differences, but, if we manipulate data in a certain way, we can "prove" that there is an equal aptitude.Don't you see anything wrong with this?I just did a search on "boys and competition" on Google and took the first link. Here it is :  [LINK] I'll quote an interesting part : " The authors then studied the speed of the children in the \textbf{race}. When the children ran alone, there was no difference in performance. In competition, boys but not girls improved."Again, I just took the first link returned by Google. Almost all studies shows this. Competition is the motivator for boys.Having said that, I'll give you another study, this one about studies in psychology :  [LINK] So basically, most psychology studies are bullshit. And the worse is that was not about broad affirmation like boys and girls are the same, but about specific and measurable tests.We can't do real research in psychology.

Being able to cooperate is essential to any individual who lives in a society and societies must absolutely limit competition to allow the ability to cooperate to evolve. An ultra competitive society will self-destruct.Do women share, have compassion and want "equality" when it favors them? Of course! They're not \textbf{dumb}. It's exactly the same as saying men respect laws only when it favors them. It's exactly the same as saying men will go to war only when it favors them.By the way, if you think women do not compete when they "share", you obviously don't know much about women.You say that a woman's brain is too solipsistic to realize anything? That's certainly not true. Women are obsessed with what the others are thinking. Men view structure and roles, women view individuals and relationship. But neither of them have a "solipsistic brain".As for this "winning" thing, "winning" an Internet argument is completely worthless.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@William Baric Yeah, of course I didn't mean in a 100 competitive society. It was meant as in a reasonably competitive one.My problem with the sharing, compassion, equality, was the hypocrisy. And no, there isn't a movement of men, which claims they want one thing, which actually pushing for what they say they are against. For feminists (and to be honest women in general too), they love to dress their agenda in pretty words such as "equality", while at the same time they push for female supremacy, and male oppression. They want the benefits of being women, while getting the benefits of being male, but without the corresponding responsibilities. I've heard this statement from so many females, and not from even one male - "I know this is wrong/not right/bad/whatever, but it's right for me!" - NEVER FROM A MAN. Last time I heard it, was a couple of days ago. And almost no women find an issue with such an overall approach. This speaks VOLUMES for the female brain. And this is the female solipsism I'm talking about. Another example - why so many guys go out, meet a girl, ask for her number, she gives it, he says "I'd like to go out with you one of the next few days", she says "yeah, why not?", and then she flakes. SO many times, and I'm not talking about myself only, this is the same bullshit that men all around the world deal with, and they can agree that it happens. On the other hand I don't see many women complaining from the same issue. If a guy exchanges contacts with a girl, he is more than willing to see her again and plans to follow up on it (on average). I'll tell you why this happens - it's because women decide how they feel on the spot, do something, without looking into it in a long-term perspective, and then when they wake up the next day, they decide that "meh, I don't feel like it anymore, so the arrangement is void". They have no intention of standing by their words, if they don't currently, on the spot feel like it. To a \textbf{woman} it's all about how she feels right now.

That's why I used expressions like "in general" and "generally".As for the argument that "no civilization can survive without the one thing and the other", my point was that a particular society structure can't be optimized for both men and women at the same time, which means depending on the societies' choices, one \textbf{gender} will inevitably be favored over the other.I'll take the education system as an example. Up until the 60s, schools were organized around individual responsibilities, hierarchy and competition. This environment clearly favored boys. However, starting in the 60s, feminists pushed for a lot of reforms, and the result is since the mid 70s or the early 80s (depending on countries) the education system clearly favor girls.One solution would be segregation between men and women in society, including different roles assigned to men and women, but I'm guessing you would be completely against this idea.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/173 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.578 \\  \hline

Men aren't allowed to be weak, they're not allowed to cry, or else they'll get called pussies. God forbid can a man be scared and take a place in a lifeboat, no, he has to be brave and save all the poor helpless women. This is basically what feminism wants to stop, and a lot of men are just to stupid to realize this. At the same time women are encouraged to be fragile and innocent, men are raised to not show weakness. What feminism is working towards is not only that women should be allowed to be strong and tough, but also that men should be allowed to be weak, to be fragile, to be in needof help (like the man with breast cancer, and all men with prostate cancer), and that \textbf{gender} roles are completely annihilated.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I feel very similarly. I think with any person the situation is simply that you will agree with some of their views and disagree with others, even if your feelings about the views exist on extreme ends of the spectrum. I think people act a lot of the time like if you strongly disagree with what someone thinks, that you should feel as though that discredits them entirely, but I think that wrong. I've found people with whom I very strongly disagree with 49 times out of 50, but then there will be that one view where I think they're spot on, or they at the very least make some good points. I think it's just that it's gonna be rare to find someone who's reasoning is perfect, who doesn't have emotions and biases effecting their perspective, but that doesn't mean there aren't times where they are going to see things very logically. I think with most people you can find things you agree with. Even after understanding that, I still have trouble coming to terms with strongly agree with and strongly disagreeing with a single individuals different views, or a certain set of views with a certain label (I can find opinions of value with on each side of the \textbf{sexism} argument), and I don't know if that's my own issue or if it has to do with the us-vs-them mentality that's so prevalent, that makes me feel like I need to have a well defined set of views that fit in with an already established set of views.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I don't think you are directly addressing feminism. Feminism is defined as the the belief that women are equal to men. My question for you is who? You say feminists do this and that, who are these feminists? I do consider myself a feminist but I do realize that \textbf{sexism} against men exists. That is exactly how I found this video, because I wondered why this issue isn't addressed. Don't stereotype all feminists, I'm 99 the people you are talking about are ignorant feminists, they have the right purpose, but incorrect education on the matter. If you would like to address the issue I suggest you do so in a less vulgar manner, that way you will receive more feedback. I agree and do believe that the idea of \textbf{sexism} against men is underrated and seldom addressed, however I don't agree with all of your videos. Realize what you are saying. If there is \textbf{sexism} against women then there is also \textbf{sexism} against men. Your video titled there is no Rape culture? Really? I hear rape jokes daily. By saying it doesn't exist is thereby denying part of the problem. If we have an issue called '\textbf{sexism}' then we must recognize that there are two sides of that regarding both sexes. If you want your side as a male to be recognized and respected then you must start out by doing the same and work your way forward. Just a suggestion.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small UN Women Goodwill Ambassador Emma Watson has spoken up about being sexualised by the media and the importance of feminism in her first major speech. Read it in fullEmma Watson has given her first major speech as UN Women Goodwill Ambassador.She spoke in New York on Saturday, at an event launching the HeForShe campaign, which aims to improve \textbf{gender} equality.Her speech is reproduced in full here:Today we are launching a campaign called 'HeForShe.'I am reaching out to you because I need your help. We want to end \textbf{gender} inequality—and to do that we need everyone to be involved.This is the first campaign of its kind at the UN: we want to try and galvanize as many men and boys as possible to be advocates for \textbf{gender} equality. And we don't just want to talk about it, but make sure it is tangible.I was appointed six months ago and the more I have spoken about feminism the more I have realized that fighting for women's rights has too often become synonymous with man-hating. If there is one thing I know for certain, it is that this has to stop.ADVERTISEMENTFor the record, feminism by definition is: 'The belief that men and women should have equal rights and opportunities. It is the theory of the political, economic and social equality of the sexes.'I decided I was a feministI started questioning \textbf{gender}-based assumptions when at eight I was confused at being called 'bossy,' because I wanted to direct the plays we would put on for our parents—but the boys were not.When at 14 I started being sexualised by certain elements of the press.When at 15 my girlfriends started dropping out of their sports teams because they didn't want to appear 'muscly.'When at 18 my male friends were unable to express their feelings.I decided I was a feminist and this seemed uncomplicated to me. But my recent research has shown me that feminism has become an unpopular word.Apparently I am among the ranks of women whose expressions are seen as too strong, too aggressive, isolating, anti-men and, unattractive.Why is the word such an uncomfortable one?Not everyone has been as lucky as me Emma WatsonI am from Britain and think it is right that as a \textbf{woman} I am paid the same as my male counterparts. I think it is right that I should be able to make decisions about my own body. I think it is right that women be involved on my behalf in the policies and decision-making of my country.I think it is right that socially I am afforded the same respect as men. But sadly I can say that there is no one country in the world where all women can expect to receive these rights.No country in the world can yet say they have achieved \textbf{gender} equality.These rights I consider to be human rights but I am one of the lucky ones. My life is a sheer privilege because my parents didn't love me less because I was born a daughter. My school did not limit me because I was a girl. My mentors didn't assume I would go less far because I might give birth to a child one day.These influencers were the \textbf{gender} equality ambassadors that made who I am today. They may not know it, but they are the inadvertent feminists who are. And we need more of those. And if you still hate the word—it is not the word that is important but the idea and the ambition behind it. Because not all women have been afforded the same rights that I have. In fact, statistically, very few have been.Men, \textbf{gender} equality will help you tooIn 1997, Hilary Clinton made a famous speech in Beijing about women's rights. Sadly many of the things she wanted to change are still a reality today.But what stood out for me the most was that only 30 per cent of her audience were male. How can we affect change in the world when only half of it is invited or feel welcome to participate in the conversation?Men—I would like to take this opportunity to extend your formal invitation. \textbf{Gender} equality is your issue too.Because to date, I've seen my father's role as a parent being valued less by society despite my needing his presence as a child as much as my mother's.I've seen young men suffering from \textbf{mental} illness unable to ask for help for fear it would make them look less 'macho'—in fact in the UK suicide is the biggest killer of men between 20-49; eclipsing road accidents, cancer and coronary heart disease. I've seen men made fragile and insecure by a distorted sense of what constitutes male success. Men don't have the benefits of equality either.This is all about freedom \textbf{Gender} equality will help men tooWe don't often talk about men being imprisoned by \textbf{gender} stereotypes but I can see that that they are and that when they are free, things will change for women as a natural consequence.If men don't have to be aggressive in order to be accepted women won't feel compelled to be submissive. If men don't have to control, women won't have to be controlled.Both men and women should feel free to be sensitive. Both men and women should feel free to be strong… It is time that we all perceive \textbf{gender} on a spectrum not as two opposing sets of ideals.If we stop defining each other by what we are not and start defining ourselves by what we are—we can all be freer and this is what HeForShe is about. It's about freedom.I want men to take up this mantle. So their daughters, sisters and mothers can be free from prejudice but also so that their sons have permission to be vulnerable and human too—reclaim those parts of themselves they abandoned and in doing so be a more true and complete version of themselves.Who is this Harry Potter girl?You might be thinking who is this Harry Potter girl? And what is she doing up on stage at the UN. It's a good question and trust me I have been asking myself the same thing. I don't know if I am qualified to be here. All I know is that I care about this problem. And I want to make it better.And having seen what I've seen—and given the chance—I feel it is my duty to say something. English statesman Edmund Burke said: 'All that is needed for the forces of evil to triumph is for enough good men and women to do \textbf{nothing}.'In my nervousness for this speech and in my moments of doubt I've told myself firmly—if not me, who, if not now, when. If you have similar doubts when opportunities are presented to you I hope those words might be helpful.Because the reality is that if we do \textbf{nothing} it will take 75 years, or for me to be nearly a hundred before women can expect to be paid the same as men for the same work. 15.5 million girls will be married in the next 16 years as children. And at current rates it won't be until 2086 before all rural \textbf{African} girls will be able to receive a secondary education.If you believe in equality, you might be one of those inadvertent feminists I spoke of earlier.And for this I applaud you.We are struggling for a uniting word but the good news is we have a uniting movement. It is called HeForShe. I am inviting you to step forward, to be seen to speak up, To be the he for she. And to ask yourself if not me, who, if not now when.Thank you.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African, Gender, Mental, Nothing, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black, Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}15/1316 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.14 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Sarah McBroom In general, women do get paid less than men, that's something. Two things need to be mentioned, though. One, this discrepancy is not caused by \textbf{gender} (thus refuting the alleged that women get paid less just because they are women), and two, the average \textbf{woman} does get paid more than the average man, mainly because of the average professions they have. I am not going to enlist the reasons here because there isn't enough space in here. My master's thesis, which was exactly on this topic, had more than 200 pages. I can mention some sources for research, though: [LINK]  [LINK]  [LINK]  [LINK] ... amongst others. Also, I have to point out that iwpr is hardly any reliable, as much as mra websites aren't either, considering their only interest is proving themselves right, thus distorting facts to suit their own views.As a \textbf{woman} (considering you dismissed the other commentator because he is male), I can say that some of what you said is right, and some of what he said is right. Men and women depend on each other, and I have never seen a man being considered "weak" for asking for help, as much as I normally see men asking for women's help and vice versa. I have always seen it as complementary, what a man has a \textbf{woman} might not have and, again, vice versa. I believe you are right when you say that women's sexuality is still a taboo, while men's is more carelessly percieved, although I do think women generally judge both men and women much more than men do. And pregnancy really creates an unfair disadvantage to women, one that I'm sorry to say, I don't see a way out. Apparently we are bound to choose, I guess.On the other hand, yes, men have it harder as a whole. Fathers have barely any rights, women do receive way lower punishment for the same crime, and get more support when a victim than men. There are way more female shelters than male shelters (and male beggars, by the way). Prostate cancer is more deadly and less studied and prevented than breast cancer. More women are raped than men, but only if we exclude prison rapes, and men suffer more violence than women. Most cases of domestic abuse against men go unreported, so it is impossible to say which happens more, but at least here in my country more wives kill their husbands than the other way around.Everything I mentioned is \textbf{common} knowledge, so I'm not going to find sources, as it is quite easy to do so. In conclusion, then, yes, women are privileged if compared to men. That doesn't mean that women have it all easy, but society as a whole protects women while it creates rather unfair expectations to men.

Because jobs back then required strength. Guess who has bigger muscles? Oh yeah men. Guess who thought wars? Oh yeah men. Who were more educated and favoured by religion? Oh yeah men.

Because double standards do exist, but I don't think we should get rid of ALL of them.

In my opinion, any medical tests should be free, but apart from that while we're furious about breast cancer awareness marathons being all about female health, lets not forget we have Movember. If men have the whole month dedicated to their health issues, why shouldn't women?And about the whole "women and children first"  - this comes from the fact that men are physically stronger than females and they have better chances to survive AND from the fact that usually it's females who have to take care of children (I'm talking about the whole "women must be housewives in the first place" thing that existed since... well, the beginning of human history)  .   After all, it'd be stupid not to acknowledge that \textbf{sexism} against men exists, but, as someone already said, it still comes nowhere near \textbf{sexism} against women.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Sexism & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/213 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.408 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Jamie Windsor     Yeah, I think there are a small number of insane people out there, both male and female, and the male ones do tend to want to rape people, both women AND men, while the women ones, merely tend to want to kill and cause harm.  So of these very small number of insane men, who obsess about power and control, \textbf{sex} is just one small observable distinction, in their ritual violence.  BUT that's not what is occurring amongst the majority of events that are labeled 'rape'.  In MOST situations called 'rape', a male is honestly confused by a lifetime of disinformation about relationships and \textbf{sex} itself.  Questions about what it is, how does it work, how to do it, what is the point of it, whether to lead or follow, whether women like harsh sensation, whether they want to be restrained, what signals are valid and what are part of some nuance that may be implied... in other words, the same sort of incongruities one experiences in any social intercourse including situations such as buying products, pushing a cart around a supermarket, driving on the roads, ordering a latte, asking someone to dance, getting a phone number, negotiating for rates and services and commenting on the internet.  So 'rape' is mostly a conflict in one's behavior versus another's, and 'rape' that includes \textbf{sex}, is about \textbf{sex}.Everyone asks what a male who is raped, was wearing.  And in fact men who tease other men about being raped say things like, "Don't drop the soap", implying that rape is often situational.  Men believe, and rightly so, that if one is in prison, and they bend over in a public shower and parade their anuses to all other men, that either a psychotic power \textbf{freak} will jump on them, or someone who feels compelled to fit his penis in a hole that feels good will.  So yes, one does not want to then, bend over in a public shower and display one's asshole.  But feminists claim they have an intrinsic right, to bend over in a public shower and display their tits and pussies.  That men must restrain all motivations and maintain a distance, and while I agree both men and women 'should' be able to bend over in a public shower, and display their organs as they wish without being attacked, I also say... "Only a fucking idiot would!", and not expect that someone will disagree with their notion of personal space.  So yup, idiot victims can sometimes be to blame for idiot behavior and no, not all idiots have well defined domains of personal space.  So as a societal control mechanism, personal space doesn't work for mad men, and as for any sane guys who rape, obviously they did not understand the 'manual' they were expected to have read.  So you see, I believe in the small occurrence of abnormal psychology, mixed statistically with a wide misinformation ploy about the mechanics of poor social  training, while you simply accept the feminist party line proclaiming that men are evil, and then mirror their meme reinforced words.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Freak, Sex & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}5/517 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.967 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small No. Rape is pretty simple. When there is consent from both parties, that is not rape. When there is not consent from both parties, that is rape. It's pretty straightforward. If a girl says 'no', it's rape. If a girl is too drunk to say 'yes' (and understand what she is agreeing to), that is also rape. There's no grey area. The problem is that whilst some people make out that rape is only committed by 'psychos' and 'nutcases', the fact is that otherwise 'normal' people commit \textbf{sex} crimes. This is massively perpetuated by a culture of acceptance toward these acts. People are handed excuses and victim blaming ensues. Let's look at \textbf{sex}-related crimes as a whole. Is it out of the question that you or someone you know might post 'revenge porn' online in a moment of anger at an ex who cheated? The effects of that are potentially devastating for someone. It can have a massive detrimental effect on people's careers, \textbf{mental} well being, self esteem etc. Yet there are plenty of 'post your ex' style sites out there and no-one bats an eyelid.

I'm sure you wouldn't do that.By saying men rape because of biology and feminism can't fix that, you are contributing to a culture of acceptance of rape. It infers that it's just natural to men and that gives it credit and forgiveness. It's like saying "they can't help it". I recommend you read the article I mentioned. It addresses all the points you've been raising very well.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Common, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}2/165 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.212 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Jamie Windsor 1) I already pointed out that when you say "the reason why feminism focuses more one women".. and that is sexist because you are looking for women to be oppressed but refuse to look at men's issues. Still waiting for proof that feminists address men's issues.2) Rape does not happen because of biology... rape happens because of some men are douchebags it has \textbf{nothing} to do with education... But it doesn't tell us how to "tackle the perp".. and that is what most people ask for if it isn't for laws.. what else can we do...The flaw in this logic is you assume we are telling our boys that it is OK to rape when we have laws that contradict that notion... You have to tell the would be victim how to behave to some degree or you are setting them up for failure.. like not telling a child to stay away from a hot stove... it's ridiculous not to.. To that point.. it is NEVER the victims fault.. EVER.. but giving them tools to recognize safety from would be deviants can help and shouldn't be looked down on.Feminists seem to believe you can just tell men not to rape and they won't.... because now they have an education... you know what.. that is only half of the solution.. I'm not saying don't do that.. but to assume that's the only thing you have to do is setting up an ignorant girl to fall in the hands of a "trusting guy" and assume a false sense of security. 3) I read the article and it addresses \textbf{nothing} about men and their issues.. that is the problem with feminism and the challenge I have given to 100s of feminists.. Feminists somehow think if we bring women equal then that will help the men.. but men have issues of their own and feminism does NOT address those. (at least none that I have seen). and of the neutral \textbf{gender} issues that MAKE THEM women issues.. "because it effects them more".. that's sexist. that's feminism.4) It is a myth to think women get it worse when I'm a man and I feel I get it worse.. so.. that is anecdotal evidence... I have never been a \textbf{woman}, and I doubt she has ever been a man so she has no idea what men have gone though.... to be spit in the face simply because you are a man and "thought" to be part of the "\textbf{patriarchy}" by your so called "equality"I'm sorry.. Laura is no better than the rest of the feminists and one big "lip service".. that talks about equality but ignores male issues.I don't think she is a bad person.. I just think she is ignorant to think "women get it worse" when I think the problem is we have an issue of "the grass is always greener.." parable on our hands.5) What I posted was a snip of introducing the blog.. I went into the blog to read it and did a search for "men".. "male".. "guy" and other synonyms...and even Laura justifies her reasons why she talks mostly about women because she also thinks it "vastly effects women more" instead of addressing it as a societal issue.. she makes it a \textbf{woman}'s issue.. down playing men's issue with it. even though acknowledging men get it too.. that's horrible.6) I absolutely know that \textbf{sexual} harassment happens in the work place.. I don't deny it.. and in fact I have been victim to it (and I'm a man).. so I absolutely know it women get it worse.. But to say it's condoned? every new hire orientation talks about \textbf{sexual} harassment.. every new job I have gotten talks about it.. there is a \textbf{zero} tolerance policy in every place I have worked..On that note.. it's about what you can prove, of course feminists believe in guilty till proven innocent.. because why would someone lie? that's a good question... WHY WOULD someone lie? but I had a friend (and luckily I was there) to act as a witness to an attack on his character and defended him saying he never said anything harassing.I don't want rapist or molesters to get off scott free.. but you would rather an innocent man get put into jail or fired than let a guilty man go free.. and I am against that line of thinking.This is why I will never be a feminist because I don't feed into victimization... and most people don't.I am for \textbf{gender} equality but I will speak out about how it is unfair that women get less time in prison for the same crimes as men... Feminists say \textbf{nothing}.I will speak out how more women attain scholarships just because they are a \textbf{woman}.. and men still have to "earn them"...I will speak out about domestic violence and call it a societal issue and not make it a \textbf{woman}'s issue because "women get it worse".. It's bad no matter who it happens to.Those are the top three reasons I will never be a feminist.. and you can thank Andrea DwarkinGloria SteinemSheila JeffriesAnita Sarkeesianand many others... for every one "equality feminist" there are 100s more that are not actually for equality but supremacy.. and this is what society sees and that is why there are only 23 willing to call themselves feminists..Without a label.. I can be for the same things feminists are for without names like I listed telling me what I believe.. THOSE are the faces of feminism... feminist.org is the face of feminism... as long as 'true" feminists do not attack those people like I listed or that organization I listed... they are just as bad and are for female supremacy just like every other feminist. despite what the dictionary says.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender, Nothing, Patriarchy, Sexual, Woman, Zero & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}11/982 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.12 \\  \hline

There is social pressure to conform to \textbf{gender} stereotypes. Anyone who doesn't is seen as 'abnormal' and therefore the subject of ridicule.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I'll start from the top.Feminists care only about female rights. So you know no real feminists. Identifying yourself as one is a sign of self-hate in men. The term feminist has been used primarily because it appears to be apologizing to women for centuries of oppression, but also because the movement was originally designed to get women the vote and equal rights in the workplace. The name stuck.Egalitarians care about equality between the sexes, not just advancing one and effectively abandoning the other.The feminism TJ is talking about is Western Modern Feminism. Women have rights over their bodies here. Women here are in high paid jobs, and the wage gap has been debunked already. That is because of past feminist movements. Sure, there may be an issue worldwide with abuse of females, but that's no reason to still be harping on about it in the developed world.Feminism may well fight \textbf{racism} and \textbf{homophobia}, but I don't see why or how. I mean, feminists tend to be rational thinkers (even though they label themselves wrongly). I would be willing to bet that they are also very environmentally conscious and anti-war. These beliefs are normally kept in the same basket, you see.By identifying yourself as a feminist, you are allowing the ultra-feminists - those who would like to see men bow before them, and in some cases die - the chance to appear somewhat sane.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Hjalmar Zola Christensen Yes but in the current, first-world climate feminism is not needed. None of their arguments, however large, are valid.The wage gap is a statistical lie. A woman's career is a woman's choice, the pay associated with that is not decided by the "\textbf{patriarchy}". We cannot teach women to be what feminists want them to be.There are already laws against rape, assault and \textbf{sexual} discrimination. We cannot "teach" criminals not to be criminals. We cannot force the courts to believe every alleged rape victim is telling the truth. We cannot convict a man without evidence.To change anything else, we would have to give up the freedoms of the free world we live in. To balance the wage gap we would have to become \textbf{communist}. To change the justice system we would have to become authoritarian.I would like to highlight the issues feminism has conveniently bypassed in it's rampage for "equality". Men who are raped are far less likely to report it. Men who are assaulted by their partners will not be believed when it comes to court. Men who want custody of their child have to fight the legal system in order to do so. Men who are accused of rape are shunned by society, whereas women who accuse men of rape are seen as being strong - even if there wasn't any actual rape. I would like an organisation which would fight for my own rights - BUT NOT FEMINISM - because it has tarred its own reputation. It also implies that female rights are lacking, when in fact they are not.Is it any wonder that people find feminism completely retarded when Hilary Clinton suggests women are the real casualties of war when men die? Or when Anita Sarkeesian has to troll on herself to get attention? Or when they suggest that rape accusations should be believed without evidence? When they bang on about a \textbf{patriarchy} which, when analysed, only seeks to benefit women? Or when they claim that men looking at or talking to them is equal to rape? Or simply because they appear to be unable to form cogent arguments in defence of any of their points or their entire movement?Do you see the issue I have with feminism? It has reached a point where it cannot gain any more rights for women without destroying not only the rights for men, but for everyone. I support feminism in countries where it is necessary.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Hi A.A! First time watcher, and I realize that this is an \textbf{old} video, but I feel like adding to the melting pot a bit here. The reason that we have a women and children first mentality is mainly because of an ancient sub- conscious. In a time of crisis, women are more valuable then men because as men we can inseminate multiple females, while the females have to carry the baby for around 8 months. As for children, it's a similar principle. Children are the next generation, and even if we are not related to them, we know their importance and we need to protect them. As for how it explains what is going on now, it's a similar mentality, though, as illustrated here, it can be quite cruel.

NO \textbf{woman} EVER in modern history has been legally obligated to die for their country, yet it is commonplace still. 2: The justice system. Men are less likely to receive help during domestic violence ( I've experienced this myself.) and are often viewed as the criminal even when you were the one being assaulted. Men are more likely to be judged guilty and receive longer sentences for the same crimes. 3: Men are less likely to receive treatment in hospitals and \textbf{mental} sickness is a lot more disregarded compared to females.4: \textbf{Sexual} assault research only focuses on women, barely any research on it has been done on men. A report from the UK issued by their own public health organization stated that 40 of all victims of pedophilia had female attackers.

I also can't do anything about the fact that they try to slap me when I do something they don't like or refuse a request for help.

"She started it!" never works if they didn't see it happen. I think your original story is a false positive for \textbf{sexism}.Where does \textbf{sexism} against men happen? Whenever something bad happens to a guy and he cries and is treated like a wimp instead of being given a shoulder. When a guy gets hit and no one intervenes. When male rape is treated as impossible.Where does \textbf{sexism} against women happen? In the workplace and business, primarily. Anywhere there are positions of power. In the middle east. In any country where women aren't allowed to vote. At the parties where guys grab at us without asking. When women are raped and people victim blame. Or when we are shamed for having too much \textbf{sex}. And in the movies (see: Bechdel Test).In the extreme, you have men who get treated like they can do anything, and if they can't, they aren't real men. Their lives however, are expendable, and they don't have feelings, they just act.The women, meanwhile, are treated as precious and perfect and worth protecting. But they receive less respect, less pay, and they aren't considered to be any threat, as though they are incapable of what men can do.Women aren't respected for what they can do. Men are undervalued for who they are.This is because men are seen as subjects, women as objects. Which is what feminists have said all along.The thing to realize is, this dichotomy is damaging to both genders, more or less equally, and in very different ways.We need to show men more compassion, and women more respect.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Sex, Sexism & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}4/300 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.333 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Pablo Grant Interesting way of putting it. I don't disagree with you that this happens, though wouldn't "going out and making money" qualify as action and therefore fit the subject/object dichotomy? Maybe we should call it "subjectification"...Not that housework isn't an action too. It's just much less glamorous. Meanwhile there's no denying the push for physical beauty, which is more intense on women than men. (I'd even say that, to some extent, housework is about keeping the home "beautiful" and an extension of that)You could say that men and women are both treated as subjects AND objects in a stereotypical way. I'm arguing the subject half for men is more intense and the object half for women more intense. So though I do agree that \textbf{sexism} is bigger than just the subject/object dichotomy, I still think that dichotomy exists as a larger pattern.I like your point it's just a standard part of how the brain categorizes things, though, and in some respects it is good. I mean that if you tried to treat your math teacher as your friend instead of generically as a math teacher, that could lead to trouble. Such categorizations are not intrinsically bad, they are there to help us organize the world.It's when we start disadvantaging someone or talking down to someone or ignoring someone's plight because of their category that we get \textbf{sexism}.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Sexism & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/232 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.862 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Jade Harley It isn't just men that have this revulsion. Some women dislike the label as well, and choose not to identify with it because of the 'raging female supremacist harpy' stigma attached to it.The issue is that you take no steps to distinguish yourself from female supremacists if you just use the term 'feminist.' When feminists talk about "the \textbf{patriarchy}," to anyone who hasn't taken a women studies class (IE almost everyone), it sounds like they're explicitly blaming the problems of the world on men.To have a constructive dialogue in the real world, you need to abandon silly words that make it insanely obvious (whether it's true or not) that you're just talking about how men being in charge is bad for everyone. The terminology that feminists tend to fall back on are fine in a classroom, but if the goal is to have a social movement rather than academic observation, then you need to rethink how you communicate.It's not that tricky. Don't apply any label to yourself (feminist, MRA, whatever), talk about "\textbf{gender} equality issues" rather than "men's rights" or "women's rights," and say "the way that society views men and women" rather than "the \textbf{patriarchy}," and you'll be making the same points, but in a way that might actually have a chance of changing someone's perception. If a lot of your ideas sound wonky using these kinds of words, then it's possible that there is bias inherent to your arguments and beliefs that you're unaware of.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender, Patriarchy & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}3/252 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.19 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Jade Harley \@zero132132 Semantics aside, I'm going to go ahead and try to lay out the case that men's issues are actually due to the same phenomena feminists talk about. I'll use women hitting men, since I've thought it through.The reason people think it's acceptable for women to hit men is that women are seen as weak and powerless at all times, even when they are the aggressor. Our perception is that women pose no threat to men; we dismiss them as harmless. We forget that they can use blunt objects as weapons, and instead focus on the abstract idea that a man can easily overpower a \textbf{woman}. So we see the \textbf{woman} as an \textbf{underdog} challenging a greater power and winning. If the man calls for help, we wonder why. After all, it's just a girl, why does he need help? Isn't he a real man?Meanwhile, if a man hits a \textbf{woman}, it's seen as someone in power abusing their power and attacking something weak and helpless. Not just something weak, but something precious and to worth protecting. Like kicking a puppy dog, the man has crossed a moral event horizon and there's no way we can feel sympathy for him even if it was in self defense.Of course, here, it's not so much an established \textbf{patriarchy} as a perception that is a problem. We see the male as being in power...even when he has no power at all. So the real difference is in the perceptions and the assumptions of power. In any given situation, the men are assumed to have the answers, the ability to solve the problems, the ability to lead. We overlook the women and dismiss them as harmless trifles.Men are respected for their capabilities. Women are by default dismissed and not respected for being able to do stuff. This is because men do stuff, women are stuff. Men are subjects, women are objects.This does not mean women get only the short end of the stick. We value both doing and being in this society. While men get respected for what they can do, women are valued for who they are. They are seen as intrinsically precious - something to protect.We put enormous pressure on men, expecting them to "take it like a man" whenever they encounter difficulties in life, and to not express their feelings. If a man faces a difficulty and cries, he is considered wimpy. We don't immediately provide him with a shoulder for support. There's a lack of compassion for him. Fewer social institutions he can go to for help. There are women's shelters, but you don't see many men's shelters. In this dichotomy men are given the responsibility of running the world, and taking care of the precious women; the women are to be quiet and stay out of the man's way. If a man can't handle his responsibility, he is now a worthless thing, neither capable nor valued.So women are not respected as subjects, and men are not valued as objects. Both are lacking in what the other \textbf{gender}, by default, has.What I gather feminists want to do, and should be trying to do, is gain respect for women's capabilities, for their leadership, for the quality of their opinions. To be perceived in any given situation as equally powerful, able, and respectable as men.But men need something too! - compassion, care, protection, their lives valued, their feelings expressed, love.What women lack in society, and what men lack in society, are arguably very different things. Having two different movements makes sense to me, because of this.If we can obtain these things, then when a \textbf{woman} hits a man, we won't see a powerless, precious thing virtuously attacking something powerful yet expendable whose job was to protect that \textbf{woman} and therefore is probably deserving of the attack, but rather one human being hitting another; both of them precious human lives, both very capable of large amounts of damage.[Of course, \textbf{gender} stereotyping is far wider in scope than a simple Do/Be dichotomy. But it should demonstrate how the subject/object principle is damaging to men as well as women in at least two ways each: very high expectations for men's capabilities (if they fail, they are devalued), meanwhile overlooking or dismissing female capability; and too high expectations on female beauty and personality traits (if they fail, they are devalued), meanwhile overlooking or dismissing male worth.]Final Side Note: Women are basically treated similar to children. Children get even less respect and are seen as far less capable than adults, while being treated as intensely precious things to protect. So one way to counter some of the unconscious notions is to keep reminding yourself that women are adults. In fact, I am of the opinion that we should go even beyond respect of women, and start respecting children as full persons, too; not giving them careers, but showing respect for their concerns and listening to what they say at least. The only person I've seen respect children this way is Mr. Rogers (from Mr. Rogers Neighborhood).\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender, Patriarchy, Underdog, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General, Social Class - Destitute & \cellcolor{green!27}9/854 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.054 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Caitlin BallWhile you are at it, you might want to look a bit closer at this "original feminism" idea. The sad fact is that what most people (and I suspect you as well) believe is \textbf{nothing} more than a lie.Some of the earliest organised roots of feminism is the anti-suffragist movement. A movement of women who opposed women getting the vote. Mainly because they feared that they would also get the obligations that came with the privilege when men got the vote (such as the draft). As we all know, they got the privilege but never a single one of the obligations.That was basically the "first wave" of feminism."Second wave" feminism was the hyper militant variety that gave the world the SCUM manifesto, Andrea Dworkin etc.It was \textbf{nothing} more than pure hate.Look up Erin Pizzey. She is considered one of the leading experts on domestic violence. Back during the "second wave" days, she was held as a champion and hero by feminists for being responsible for the creation of some of the first women's shelters. She then realized that most domestic violence is reciprocal and that in non-reciprocally violent relationships, WOMEN are actually the aggressor  70 of the time (which has been varified by many studies since). But when she came forward with this and suggested that there was also a need for men's shelters, she became feminisms most hated enemy. She and her family (including her children and grandchildren) received so many death threats from feminists that she needed police protection and had her mail checked by bomb disposal units. They even killed her family's dog when they couldn't get to her. Eventually she had to leave the country.And all she did was tell the truth. That particular truth just happened to by unpopular with feminists.She now works for men's rights.That brings us to today and the so called "third wave" of feminism."Third wave" feminism is all about female superiority. Getting as many privileges and as few responsibilities for women as possible.Just take a look at laws in the western world.I will happily give you as many examples as you would like, of laws that directly discriminate against men to benefit women.Feminism today has two main weapon: Victim-hood and shaming.They do everything to ensure that women are seen as victims in all things and use that as a platform for preferential treatment. This is mostly done through made up "statistics" and emotional appeals.While these non-arguments fall apart as soon as you look at them critically, most people never question it and those who do are attacked and quite often end up loosing jobs or worse as a result of public shaming campaigns.A very sad fact is that today's feminists are among the worst thing to ever happen to women. Their relentless to make sure that all women are considered victims by default, is the same as saying that women are not capable of taking responsibility for themselves. Many feminist sponsored western laws have reduced women to children in the eyes of the law.Any \textbf{woman} who considers herself more than a helpless, irresponsible child with no personal agency, should be fighting AGAINST feminism.Bottom line. The feminism that people think is all about equality, never existed. It is the lie that are told to the unquestioning masses to get their support. And that support is what gives them the legitimacy that they need to gain the political power to affect laws.If you care about equality then don't give your support to those who are actively fighting against equality. Don't legitimise them by calling yourself a feminist when that does not accurately describe you position. Call yourself a humanitarian, egalitarian or something entirely different.

Any society should clearly define the social role of each \textbf{gender}.

It was the women that defined the image of men - a skilful hunter, brave soldier, protector of the \textbf{woman}, a knight.  The men would start wars and build temples for women. To prove the love for the women men developed crafts, skills, arts and sciences.  The viability of any \textbf{nation}, any society is exclusively determined by the attitude of women towards men.

The \textbf{gender} role that women feel is pushed on them is equal to the \textbf{gender} role pushed on men. Men are expected to be tough, ignore emotions instead of coping, and to some degree violence is expected of us also. The \textbf{gender} role which oppresses men is in many ways the cause of some female oppression. The so called "rape culture" is not a result of men being innately sexist and violent, but a result of them being expected to be sexist and violent in the same way that women are expected to be passive and obedient. This has caused many logical, passive, and moral men to feel misrepresented by feminists. The \textbf{woman} in your Feminism vs. Freedom of Speech video actually offends me.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Ferdinand Salazar That's just fucking silly. Staying home and eating sweets isn't objectively the ultimate joy and life purpose of women. That's an example of REAL \textbf{sexism}. You're assuming that if you just give women sweets and a place to live then they're plenty happy and that's all they need - no reason to give them any choice in what they do or any rights. My point was that \textbf{sexism} is on both sides. Men, like I said, have a \textbf{gender} expectation of aggression and toughness, which is why they were sent to war and died in massive numbers. Is that injustice? Yes, and in more ways than just a \textbf{gender} issue. That being said, your choice of a single poorly defined example doesn't somehow disprove that women have been oppressed throughout history - mainly because all kinds of people have been oppressed... since the beginning of civilization. Additionally, this concept that all women labelled men who stayed behind cowards - it's imaginary. Sure - they only sacrificed their husbands. I seriously doubt there are a great many women who wouldn't rather have known their husband was safe doing something besides fighting a war.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I almost fell asleep of boredom from the first minute; however, I managed to push through so to make a comment.\textbf{Sexism} against men does not exist…simply because women are not powerful enough to exploit men. Sure, a \textbf{woman} in the workplace might have a higher position or get paid more…but bottom line is any man could physically hold a \textbf{woman} down and have his way with her despite any perception of her in the workplace or world for that matter. Allow me to continue:You do not even resemble a man, you look more like a throwback hippie wearing poindexter glasses bitching and moaning about nonsense. Like hippies do...In my experience most people in positions of power are male, simply because they are far more competent when it comes to handling people since they do not become emotional or too power hungry like women do in a social situation. Men have had a far greater impact on human history in general since we have carried all the burdens of real work and innovation.Men are also superior when is comes to driving, earning more money for the same job or any job for that matter, coordination, physical strength, \textbf{mental} capacity, abilities, being honest, multitasking, \textbf{sex}, tipping, not being sexist, inventing, changing the entire world, leaving an impression for generations to read about hundreds of years later, and creating new and awe inspiring technologies which make our lives easier which you women take for granted. We have Albert Einstein, Leonardo Da Vinci, George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Stephen King, Isaac Asimov, Ludwig van Beethoven, George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, Superman, Steven Hawking, Isaac Newton, Spiderman, Adolf Hitler (one of the most powerful humans in history, no \textbf{woman} has ever achieved such power for either good or evil), Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, Optimus Prime, Eric Drexler, Jonas Salk (cured polio and eventually aids had he not died), John Hancock, Linus Pauling, Alexander Fleming, Sigmund Freud,Thomas Alva Edison, Charles Darwin, Galileo Galilei, Luke Skywalker, Orson Welles, Rembrandt, Michelangelo, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Jesus Christ, Nicolai Tesla, Santa Claus, and Genghis Khan, just to name very very few.Who have women got aside from...Margaret Thatcher? Wow, I had to think for that one lol. Any \textbf{woman} that actually did make something of herself was only due to the fact she rode the coat tails of a hard working man. So when you think about it...there have been and are MORE men in greater positions than women for many good reasons. And you are lucky you got to work in one piece by not crashing the car…your husband or boyfriend probably dropped you off since you failed your driving test. Just some food for thought bitch.There is only one thing women need to be responsible for since they barely do anything. 1. Cook at home for the Man. 1. Please the Man sexually so to not give him reason to move on or cheat on you. 1. Always be in fear of him being dissatisfied with anything. 1. Bake something if you get bored. 1. Frequently bring a smoking hot girlfriend over for your Man to look at and offer him a 3-way even if it disturbs you mentally.It's a MAN world out there, remember that.

What usually happens if a male hits a female, or even is a female hits a male and the male hits back, is the female hits back and tells a figure of authority (institution would be professors or advisors, maybe president, outside of an institution would be father or boyfriend, other males or females, boss, or even the judicial system) and then this authority figure either beats up on the male or reprimands them in one way or another, suspension, being fired, prison etc. while the female gets away with exchanging the punch or punching first\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}3/176 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.705 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Max Werner Yes men have seen the " feminists who are extremely \textbf{weird} and say things that might sound stupid". Like you know, these feminists who call for the castration of or systematic purging of men down to 1 of the human population. I don't classify that as "\textbf{weird}" I classify that as threatening and dangerous.What I haven't seen is the other "good" feminists you speak of, standing up and shouting those "\textbf{weird}" voices down. You paint a very sterile face for feminism that isn't real. You want to believe that feminism is a good thing, so you marginalize the side of feminism that is,what you call "\textbf{weird}", what I call subversive and anti-social. You just can't bring yourself to look at the mountains of evidence that proves the majority of feminism today is a hateful group of bigots, who deny the social obligations and accountability of women, while working tirelessly to maintain and protect, through legal means, women's privilege in contemporary society.You speak of the mystical 13 income difference between men and women. However you ignore the studies that prove once women's work place privileges (i.e. maternity leave, shorter work weeks, and women leaving the work force to raise children) is removed from the equation, that 13 you speak of disappears. You will then marginalize the fact that because so many of these privileges are protected by law it proves women have to work less than men to maintain the same amount, if not more, job security than men.  Here's a fun statistic for you, 57 of university graduates in the USA are women verses 43 men. How does that figure into your "we teach our daughters to be good at staying at home and taking care of everything" theory? This is yet more proof that the "\textbf{patriarchy}" that feminists harp on and on about is \textbf{nothing} more than a lie they propagate to maintain political relevance, and to protect their oppressive biological matriarchy they hold over our society with an iron grip.Furthermore, what are they (you) doing that's so positive. Feminism thus far has not increased the number of women who report \textbf{sexual} assault to the authorities. Feminism has not reduced the number of women who enter the \textbf{sex} trade. Feminism has not decreased the numbers of single mothers below the poverty line. Feminism has not increased the number of female teenagers on birth control. In fact these numbers have stayed about the same of the last 50 years. I haven't seen one feminist paper or video about any of these things here on Youtube. I have, however, seen several video's telling men that being a "nice guy" is sexist, or men should be "castrated", or it's men's fault women have to wear makeup, or all MRM's are rape apologists. So again where is this good, positive feminism that is working for the betterment of humanity that you seem to identify yourself with so passionately? Saying "I am a feminist who believes in \textbf{gender} equality", is like saying "I am a \textbf{racist} who believes in racial equality" its an oxymoron.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender, Nothing, Patriarchy, Racist, Sex, Sexual, Weird & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!5}10/515 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.942 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small i can't respond to all the points you had cause it takes too much time but here's an explanation to some of your problems:1. Here's a fun statistic for you, 57 of university graduates in the USA are women verses 43 men - That's because we expect more out of a little girl than boys, because they mature faster. A boy playing instead of listening to his teacher is much more commonly seen in our culture than a girl doing the same. Another reason for that statistic is that alot of "manly" (man dominated) jobs don't need that much education, but they still get payed much. the "womanly" jobs however get payed way less even though the same education was required. And now i know what all you liberals will say about this: A \textbf{woman} can choose to work at the male dominated job then, the doors are open for anyone. YES BUT a \textbf{woman} is not encouraged to do so by society, alot of women who want to work as for example a construction worker are emediately looked down upon as being non womanly or gross or unattractive or whatever degrading you might think of in this situation. I'm not saying everyone thinks this way but the majority of people, i would say, do.2. Feminism thus far has not increased the number of women who report \textbf{sexual} assault to the authorities. Feminism has not reduced the number of women who enter the \textbf{sex} trade. Feminism has not decreased the numbers of single mothers below the poverty line.- YES IT HAS i don't know where you've got your statistics from, or what country, but feminism has done alot of good things. I can't speak for what it has done for your country but for sweden it has increased the reports of rape, however our politics are so fucked up that many of the proven cases of rape still get denied. feminism has created alot of shelters for women who are oppressed or getting sexually abused and so on. just look this shit up you can easily google what feminism has done.3. However you ignore the studies that prove once women's work place privileges (i.e. maternity leave, shorter work weeks, and women leaving the work force to raise children) is removed from the equation, that 13 you speak of disappears - That is irrelevant because because women taking care o the kids is a patriarchal structure. We expect women to take care of the kids and we teach them to enjoy doing so. For example when we give our daughters baby-toys that they take care of and feed and so on. By doing this we encourage them to do so later on in their life because this is what they've learnt to enjoy! So no, women don't work less because they're lazy, they work "less" because they're working unpayed at home.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Sex, Sexual, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}4/484 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.826 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Max Werner I am from the USA, and I can assure you that all my claims have statistical backing. 1) Your logic is unsound, based on one very sound principle, you don't educate slaves. If women are "slaves" to the \textbf{patriarchy}, as you imply, then why would said \textbf{patriarchy} waste the HUGE amount of resources it takes to educate them? Why would we require more education out of women if our cultural idea regarding women was for them to "stay at home and take care of the babies"? Based on your argument, you have to admit that is a HUGE waste of resources. At one point in human civilization, it is true, women where expected to carry out domestic responsibilities while men carried out cumulative collection of resources for his family or social group. But not anymore. Maybe that is your problem. Maybe you are basing your argument on historical data (which I grant you is correct but was based on the paradigm of the human cooperative agreements not oppression) that simply is not the situation in the modern western culture anymore. Healthcare administration and direction is 92 dominated by women in the USA, education and school administration is 71 dominated by women in the USA. Both vital industries,both require astronomically high levels of education, both dominated by women. You can not find a single comparison industry for men in the US. That is proof that \textbf{patriarchy} is a myth. 2) How can a "proven case of rape" be denied? Sweden has jurisprudence, which means they have a legal structure. They also follow Ei incumbit probatio qui dicit, non qui negat (the burden of proof is on he who declares, not on he who denies). If rape is "proven", are Sweden's judges saying, "guilty of the charge of rape, you are free to go Mr. Rapist"? I highly doubt that. But now that I know you are in Sweden, I did some checking. The number of single mothers under the poverty line has went down since 1984 (well done you) but the feminist movement had no hand in it. This change was brought about by government policies to increase living conditions for all households in your country. Men got this lifestyle economic increase as well. No where could I find any articles or studies linking these governmental policy changes with the feminist movement. Not even from feminists themselves have claimed it. The number of \textbf{sex} trade workers in Sweden has increased by 27 since 1991 and for Sweden that is saying something. Plus in 2009 the Swedish government released statistics that stated \textbf{sex} crimes are reported more frequently than in any other country in the E.U. but the number of \textbf{sex} crimes reported increased by 58 over 10 years.  Even with the increased reports sounds like Sweden has a real problem with \textbf{sex} crimes, how are the feminists helping that?3)Your assumption on this bullet point is that women are "forced" to take care of children. Are you saying that no \textbf{woman} wants to take care of her off spring? No one "forces" women to leave the work force. In face, here in the states, it was found that 61 of women who leave the workforce to take care of children do so against their mates wishes. Men here do not want to lose the income a \textbf{woman} brings home. So your argument again is unsound based on the fact women are not "forced" to do anything, except gestate the fetus and if you have a problem with that take it up with nature or god or whatever because that is definitely not men's faults.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Patriarchy, Sex, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}9/605 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.488 \\  \hline

My original as well as continued argument was that men are not less important in anyway, and the value of a \textbf{sex} is not solely based on the reproductive abilities, it is also based on continued survival of the human \textbf{race}. Don't believe me? I'll quote myself: "We are equally important. But with your original argument that would mean men are more important because the man is the holder of the semen which impregnates Women." This was proving the statement goes both ways meaning I neutralized his argument. Following up with: "Men and Women have different contributions to the survival of humanity, those contributions equal out, Women are better than men at some things and men are better than women at somethings. We arent equal in everything but added up,men and women are just as important. we are equal overall." As well as: "We are exactly equal overall, men are superior in some areas and so are women it evens out overall men can self reproduce with science so can women." This was to neutralize all arguments of superiority through the mere fact that reproduction does not hold value in the current world as humans can now be created not born.

Admittedly women were only defenceless because patriarchal attitudes, which dictated that women were the weaker \textbf{sex} and therefore were often treated like children.

These "honour killings" also happen in western countries. Women in Muslim countries can be stoned for "having an affair", even if that affair was rape. In fact rape is more often used against women as a form of domination. Domestic violence against women is likewise more \textbf{common} than against men.

Just use your \textbf{common} sense and think about this for a minute: if someone stronger and someone weaker are in a physical fight, which one is likely to come off worse? Obviously the weaker. Therefore violence against women is more dangerous. You are also ignoring the fact that in many countries domestic abuse against women is legal.I'm sorry, but are you genuinely claiming that there is a conspiracy theory concerning the wage gap between men and women? When a study done last November showed female graduates in the UK earned 5 grand less than men? Next you'll try claiming that men are disposable slaves to women- oh wait, you did that. The \textbf{sexual} objectification I was referring to is the fact that many men choose not to view women as thinking, feeling human beings, but instead as objects designed for their gratification and pleasure. I am not saying that \textbf{sexual} desire is wrong in either \textbf{gender}- that would be ridiculous. But I am saying that in many countries and in certain sections of western society women are not treated like equals.I am not, and never claimed to be, a feminist.The reason I do not identify myself as such is because feminists tend to ignore the massive global issues of \textbf{gender} equality and focus instead on what cannot even be deemed first world problems.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Common, Gender, Sexual & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}4/268 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.493 \\  \hline

Because by creating certain institution for women only you are just creating more arguments which ends up in solving \textbf{nothing} at all And yes you are right certain institutions SHOULD be open to everyone but why stop and medicine and politics? Why don't we open up beauty and hair salons to men because you cant deny that a man can hardly get a job in one of them as they are male that is just an attitude built into society which women need to change just as much as men need to change their attitudes also. And how dare you say that men don't feel pressured to look good!!! I was REALLY insulted by that, everyday I wake up and look at my self in the mirror and almost vomit I swear I hate how I look and my body shape, my legs are hairy and my legs are big. I know that in reality I am not that ugly and very few people call me ugly but regardless society has told me that I am imperfect and that I need to be extremely \textbf{thin} and to have a six pack If I am going to be attractive to anyone, I know that this isn't the case and that to some people I might appear attractive (although God knows why they would think that, some people are into different things I guess and I am pretty sure that EVERYONE can find someone who thinks they are attractive) but regardless it is not only women who feel pressured to look good and we need to not only change that for women but for men also. (I would like to mention that I am heavily against these beauty magazines especially the ones that photo shop the women as I think it send a negative message to them. every time I see a \textbf{woman} who has been driven to starving herself because of this and yes I realise that the problem is far heavier for women it make me feel sick. And I am a male) To fight these images the \textbf{common} \textbf{woman} and man need to stand together, hold hands and show that we are equal and we were made to be equal, that it shouldn't matter what  we look like on the outside and what \textbf{gender} we are a part of but who we are on the inside, and we can do that if we address the attitudes that people have towards the other \textbf{gender} not towards statistics about who has more jobs in what areas because when we get to the root of it there will always be inequality among certain jobs and that isn't the problem the problem is the attitude people have towards that. Yeah I get your point about this \textbf{old} boys club that everyone seems to talk about but these men are going to die off and we should just make sure that the next people who get the jobs have been educated to believe that everyone is equal and that the most qualified person gets the job.

You can't talk as if you know a man and how 'uneasy the mere presence of females makes us' unless you are a man. Are you a man?Also I never assumed that the end goal of feminism was at suffrage. That was about equality, this is note. Equality is a two-way street.I will reiterate my question from before, are you a male or a female? You talk about men as if they are some foreign species. We want exactly what you want, equality. You seem to want handouts based on \textbf{sex} or skin colour. I'm not saying that we should treat all areas as equal, but they should at the very least receive the attention that they deserve on both sides. The only place that feminists have any room to argue is in media, and that is solely based on demand. There are so many more men that spend time constantly watching movies, television, and playing video games than there are women. If you want women to have their own institutions, start a film studio aimed at 'female' entertainment. I agree that the number of \textbf{old} men running studios is concerning, but that does not mean that all content is inherently \textbf{racist}. If you don't like the capitalist method of supply and demand, there are other countries that don't serve to meet these goals.I don't see one other coherent statements to make a response to. If English is your second language, maybe you should write in your first and I will translate it to make it easier for both sides.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nobody, Old, Racist, Sex, Zero & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s, Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}5/344 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.453 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Mmm .. I am a female. I am not particularly against our economic system. I am nor pro nor against feminism, and I have no problem with men- I grew up with many. I try look at things at an even keel. However, I never mentioned anything about handouts, on the contrary, perhaps it will serve in your benefit to reread what I wrote.  I am not new to the universal mindset, as you can agree there is one above any individual. I am not denying your claims and moreso agree with some: especially pertaining to media, entertainment,and your right. Let's agree that both men and women have seperate functions as ordained to specifically western ( predominantly 1st world- arguably american) society tradition: women- madonna/whore/bimbo/sexy dork/sexy doc/sexy nurse/sexy cat ( ohh but well, we do this all for ourselves anyway) men- provider, military tool, macho fucker- yes those can be troubling, now let me add the extra dimensions allowed to your \textbf{gender}- intellect, fool, savant, etc- despite the classifications at the end of the day, I am not going to be seeing how your physical characteristics have deflected any of these from the main quarry- that men are multidimensional and women are not. Theres a reason women dont run for government, and thats because no one wanted a job after the previous election that obviously ate women alive, since no one gave a shit about your qualifications- prime example- most women in political seats. There is \textbf{misogyny} even among women. However, I dont aim to argue, just to reverb. It sucks that now there are groups that disqualify you. No one told the guy to skip out on a hospital visit during his chest pains- he purposely tried to 'infiltrate' this circle with ambition and nobility. I am sure most men however, are not iching for a job that all of society denotes as lower class/simple labor, as most of those positions belong predominantly to women.. I have no doubt that most people generally do not cry about this being a lost opportunity. At the end of the day, all vague stats, and insults aside, I am simply saying, it sucks! When your welcome in most circles, and now your finding that you are exempt from some. I guess the next wave of anything is going to be men from feeling so alienated from women. But while constant objectifation doesnt help, Im sure you are just as much a victim from \textbf{gender} constructed flaws. its only a little easier because history and law is on your side.  longliverockanroll- dont get so mad, its only a conversation. If only people saw outside of themselves, and what theyre meant to think. There is no substance behind your insults. Just because you are mad doesnt make you right. I am very much for both genders pulling their heads out of their asses but we probably wont live to see that day. Ps.

Kind of ironic. Your first example was unfortunate, and I hope he sued. Occasionally men are disadvantaged due to their \textbf{sex}, but very rarely in comparison to women.

When "Feminazi's (i.e. actual angry women, not all feminists) go around preaching how they are feminists and represent "feminism" how am I supposed to NOT see them as the poster children for what modern feminism represents?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Hey TJ, I just wanted to supply some citations for you. Big fan by the way.According to Cancer.gov the estimate for 2013 for both Breast and Prostate cancer is as follows.Breast Cancer: New cases: 232,340 (female); 2,240 (male) Deaths: 39,620 (female); 410 (male)Prostate Cancer: New cases: 238,590. Deaths: 29,720So as we can see there are roughly 8-9 thousand more men getting breast or prostate cancer each year than there are women, however since breastcancer has a higher mortality rate and considering that it's a rare condition for men, more women die. Now these numbers are current and we as a society is doing a lot to help women in diagnosing and treating breast cancer taking that into account i speculate that the female deathtoll would be much higher if breastcancer had received the same amount of attention as prostatecancer, so to sum up. I completely agree with your notion of female privilige, but I also understand why we as a society has chosen to focus our attention at breast cancer before prostate and I don't think it's entirely because of the afflicted's \textbf{gender}. As for an argument for \textbf{sexism} against men I believe that the "\textbf{old} but gold" is referring to the fact that there is an extreme bias in costudy cases.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small TL:DR - there's a pervasive tendency in society to see women as being for \textbf{sex}, to devalue their actual accomplishments, personality, strengths etc., and to place a disproportionate emphasis on their looks.

My bad for not putting it better.If you approach a \textbf{woman} because you find her hot, I'm not expecting you to automatically see her as highly intelligent or anything before you talk to her. The problem doesn't come from finding a \textbf{woman} sexy, or talking to her because you find her hot - it comes from not seeing them as anything but \textbf{sex} objects.

Men who are the victims of physical or \textbf{sexual} domestic violence at the hands of their intimate partners (yes, many abusers are women) often have absolutely no resources available.
