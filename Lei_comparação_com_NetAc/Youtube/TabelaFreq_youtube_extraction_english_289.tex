  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Are we going to sit here and pretend that the English are native to Britain? If my memory serves me correctly (and it does), the Anglo-Saxons invaded the British Isles and replaced the Romano-British and Celtic populations. The Anglo-Saxons and Jutes invaded from modern day Denmark and northern Germany, and before that, they had probably migrated south-west from modern day Sweden. That generally tends to be the migration pattern of most Germanic tribes during that time. It was during the Roman conquests of the Gauls and other Celtic tribes that spurred the Germanic tribes to migrate southwards out of Sweden into Northern Germany, Poland, and Eastern Europe. And it was likewise, the Hunnic invasions and weakening of the Roman Empire, that pushed a new Germanic migration/invasion westward into modern day Britain, France, the Lowlands, Spain, and Italy. I'm sorry, but what country isn't made up of stolen land. We all came from somewhere different and made new homes and countries where we settled. Should the Turkish give Turkey back to the Greeks. Should the Arabs accept Israeli rule. How about England? Maybe we should give England back to the Cornish, Welsh, Highland Scots, etc...? That's right BBC, it's time for you to pack up and move back to Southern Sweden where you ancestors came from some 1,600 years ago. This is not to say however, that Native Americans as a demographic are not being unfairly treated. I lived quite some time in an Alaska Native village and there are certainly issues that must be addressed, both in terms of \textbf{racism} and community/social problems. Alcoholism and drug use is rampant and there needs to be both more social accountability, and public resources to help overcome these challenges that plague the futures of their communities.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Racism & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/293 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.341 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Comanches came in and took the land from the Apaches by war, Aztecs, Incas and Mayans all grew their empires by conquering lands from other tribes. The Tainos and Canib tribes fought over land. When Spain Defeated the Aztec empire, the did so with an army of 1,000 Spanish soldiers and 75,000 soldiers from the Tlaxcallans, Choulatecs and Totonac tribes.. The practice of claiming the land of conquered enemies extended well past the colonization of America. It wasn't until the conclusion of World War II in 1945 that western culture shunned the practice (and even then, the Soviet Union claimed Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Austria, and many other territories as part of their victory spoils). To claim 'white Europeans' 'stole' America from the native tribes is to force the cultural norms of the past 50 years (that white Europeans created) on events that happened hundreds of years earlier. That is just ignorant. steal-americaAnother problem I have with the 'White people stole America from the Natives' mentality is that it is insulting to Native Americans. It portrays them as ignorant fools easily duped by the evil white man. When, in fact, the brave Native American tribes fought hard, vicious battles to preserve their lands. The United States Census Bureau in 1894 counted over 40 wars involving 'white' Americans and Native Americans between the years 1789 and 1846, which killed 19,000 whites and about 30,000 Indians. During these wars Native Americans committed atrocities against the white settlers. Slaughtering whole towns, raping, scalping, and murdering children were regular acts. During the Pontiacs War in 1764, 4 Delaware \textbf{Indian} Warriors entered a settlers log schoolhouse. There, they killed and scalped the teacher, and nine children. Two children were scalped, but survived their injuries, and 4 other children were taken prisoners. This is the first school massacre on record in America (and it happened before America was even a \textbf{nation}). As you can see, to claim that Native Americans were peace loving nomads that were fooled by the white people is just plain ignorant. If there is one thing we can learn from the Native Americans loss of land to white settlers, it is that we need to have tighter control over our immigration policies. The Native Americans believed that the first European settlers were just refugees trying to escape persecution in their homeland. They thought the American continent was large enough and the resources plentiful enough that they could share it with a few of these foreigners. But soon, these few turned into many, and the many demanded more. Soon the demands turned into violent conflicts, and the Native Americans were trapped in warfare with the new 'immigrants'. The colonists eventually conquered the Native Americans and claimed the land as spoils of war. History repeats itself, and if we are not wary these new waves of undocumented immigrants, and refugees will soon be waging war on us. The native Americans are not native to America at all can you just remember 'native' Americans derived from mongols in Eurasia they crossed the baring strait from Asia learn your history boy The so-called 'native' Americans have their chance to make America theirs but they lost the war AmericWhat schools wont teach and what someone whos great grandmother was \textbf{indian} and great grandfather irish also mentioned:Spanish, portuguese and joomigration to america and the term Marrano and the slave trade of central and southern americas. anglosaxons had little to do with any of this to.

My great grandmother was born on a reservation \& I know her first name but I never knew the last name because I guess it was supposed to be kept a secret by the turn of the century bcuz all the children were being taken away by the whites. She ended up marrying a Frenchmen \& learning to speak French \& say they were French. My grandmother was born in 1899, which is \textbf{weird} bcuz most of my friends grandparents are about 20-25 years older. But it sucks I don't know any of the history \& I watched a documentary on how so many families had to flee \& they lost their culture and history etc. \textbf{Crazy} thing is now on my mums side I am pretty much almost full Russian. lol....Anyway, I was watching the "American \textbf{Indian} wars" \& I felt like it was not so much from the Native side \& that's what I am looking for now. I get that as far as the alcoholism etc it was passed down from decades of depression \& when a culture is stripped apart and destroyed and treated like trash. As I said, my family we couldn't even say we were Native. That makes me said as I would've them rather have stood strong. However, my fiance is Greek \& his grandparents, when they came here in the 1920s-ish to NY-they had to change their names too-or they did...They all shortened their last names \& changed their first...Just terrible...You are as good as anyone! I have been happier at times in life when I had \textbf{nothing} or less than when I had it all! I think I lost so much of my Native history bcuz it was the \textbf{woman} and she married off into a different culture-and was scared! She must have been born in the 1860-70's-ish...STAY STRONG...PRIDE IS BETTER THAN "SHIT"...I WISH WE STILL LIVED IN THOSE \textbf{OLD} WAYS. I KNOW IT WAS A TOUGH LIFE, BUT IT WAS RIGHT...WHAT THE SPIRIT INTENDED...NOW LOOK WHAT'S HAPPENING. THEY ARE RUINING THE EARTH!!!

The GSC is up and to the right of me, the Conference Head is behind me twice with one of them as live action as he appeared next to the left of me when I posted that video and chuckled. I think he was live but in separate realm. I'll explain. (I'll never forget his chuckle as he tilted his head upwards) His brother is to the left of me still there as all three are to this day. He came before 05/13/19 and flew past me in another realm with three assistants all in their spacecraft. His brother was in a bronze \textbf{colored} and the three assistants were in grayish silver. We live on one of three universes in the back of his spacecraft. He placed me second in command. As you will see on hand drawing. I can't begin to explain everything, there's many visions and much detail. Can you find someone who can draw with pencil like DiCaprio did in the movie Titanic? I can not pay until monies come in. I do not want a dime of this money ever! It goes to everyone, worldwide. I can not turn away from a need.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Get outta here with your daffy ass. Do you actually think that the native Indians just germinated out of the soil of North America.? And when they did migrate to this continent, they fought amongst themselves, one tribe against another in order to expand their territory and secure the survival for the next generation. Every tribe of North America conquered other tribes and even committed genocide of other warring factions. So, before you point the finger at anyone else for spilling blood you better look at the neighbors you yourselves obliterated.  It's shit like this that just pisses me off.

Before the White man, the \textbf{Indian} tribes that the White man would eventually meet was part of the migratory wave that led to genocides of earlier tribes. When the new 'natives' settled in they turned on each other. When the White man arrived he found a mottled bunch of tribes that often fought each other, had centuries-long conflicts and grudges with one another, entire tribes sacrificed to whatever god the conquering tribe believed in. Slavery existed too before the White man arrived. What the White man did was to unintentionally exchange diseases with the natives; some diseases the Europeans brought back home, killing thousands as a result. Sadly for the natives, having a weaker immune system for lack of living close to animals and lacking the evolutionary pressure that diseases and war imposed on the Europeans, they died by the hundreds of thousands before the Europeans ever encountered them. Entire tribes lost before the White man ever saw them. Yet you people act as if the White man intentionally tried to genocide the natives when in fact there is no such proof, the Europeans was too few for centuries to have killed hundreds of thousands, and the Europeans were appalled by the misery they witnessed amongst the natives. Not only this, but the Europeans tried to help the sick natives.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Ironically, the British (you know, the people that own BBC?) Were absolutely notorious for invading other people, stealing their land, killing off the locals etc, all in the name of their glorious "empire". What a crock of shite. The British were carving up North America and the Natives with it long before the United States was even a country. Even more ironic is the Natives in this video (and the comment thread for that matter) talking about "stolen land". let's talk about how the Native Americans stole each other's land while we're at it. We can also talk about how Native Americans even practice their own forms of slavery. or better yet let's talk about a few notable massacres committed by Native Americans against their own \textbf{ethnic} brothers and sisters. Native Americans were in a constant state of war with one another for more than 15,000 years before the first Europeans set foot in North America. Steven LeBlanc, Author of the book Constant Battles: Myth of the Peaceful, Noble Savage, spent more than 30 years as a historian and archeologist. He participated in more than 20 international digs and even personally managed/oversaw more than 16 right here in the United States. He states the most prevalent and consistent findings he found at every dig-site he was at, was evidence of warfare. Look at the Pueblo in present day New Mexico and Arizona. They built huge cities (called Pueblos). These Pueblos were iconic because they had absolutely no windows (in a desert where temps reach in excess of a hundred degrees on a daily). The only method of entering these Pueblos was climbing a detachable ladder to the roof, and then climbing down a hatch in the roof into the main room. Now why would they do this? Because of raids carried out by Apache, Navajo, Tohono Od'ham, Chichimecs etc. The Anasazi people built huge cities in the cliffs called "cliff dwellings" because they offered amazing defensive capabilities. The Apache were not farmers or traders, they were raiders. They would hunt and fish until the food was scarce, and then they would raid their neighbors for whatever they could. The term Apache means "enemy" in Navajo. Now why would one Native Tribe call another an enemy? Certainly not because they were a peaceable people. The Lakota Sioux were especially infamous for their wholesale slaughter of the \textbf{Crow}, Cree, Pawnee, Kiowa etc, even pushing them out of the \textbf{Black} Hills, and then claiming it was their "religious" right! Who does that sound like to you? Oh yeah, the Christian Conquistadores  who slaughtered people at the Acoma Pueblo for no less a religious cause. How about the Massacre at Cutthroat Gap where Osage Warriors snuck into a hunting camp and slaughtered ever man, \textbf{woman}, and child? After that, to add insult to injury, they mutilated the bodies. This is known today as 'The night they were beheaded" because Osage Warriors literally decapitated the bodies. Or better yet, the Camp Grant Massacre where Tohono Od'ham Warriors snuck into a camp of sleeping Apache, and slaughtered them completely. The only survivors, 48 \textbf{woman} and children, were then taken to Mexico and sold to the government as slaves, where they died soon after. Or how about the Paleo people called the Thule who's migration from present day Alaska to Greenland ended after they completely killed off another group of people known as the Dorset, and even displaced Nordic settlers who had settled in Greenland!? Don't even get me started on the Five Civilized Tribes and their practices of Chattel Slavery. Most of these reservations sit on land that doesn't even belong to the tribe that currently lives on it, but instead belongs to another tribe their tribe historically displaced through constant raids and warfare.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Crow, Ethnic, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}5/628 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.796 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I've been to both reservations shown in the documentary. Pine Ridge is almost certainly the worst reservation in the US. Rosebud has a lot of problems with alcoholism and meth, but it isn't as bad. What isn't mentioned here at all is Pine Ridge's history, and the history of the Lakota in general. In their day, the Lakota were the bad asses, the conquerors, the \textbf{nation} that terrorized and took land and property from other tribes at will. It's ironic that the Lakota claim that they are the victims, that their land was stolen, when their way of life was all about taking what they wanted. Fun Fact: they stole their "sacred" \textbf{Black} Hills from the Cheyenne. Their last war chief, \textbf{R\textbf{ed}} Cloud, was a great strategist and warrior, the only chief to force the US to negotiate with him rather than the other way around, but he was no angel -- not to say that the US government were angels dealing with the Lakota, but out of all the tribes in the US, it was most fitting that the Lakota were taken down the same way they lived, through conquest. Nonetheless, considering the Lakota's conquering history, it was a bitter loss which is still felt today.Pine Ridge is a mess: Part of it are the idiotic layers of Washington and tribal bureaucracy that tends to stifle innovation and industry. It is a socialist, welfare state. The government doles out food, basic housing, a stipend, free health care, and free secondary education (if you get that far). It's enough to live on, but there's no pride in it, and it promotes a victim mentality. Worst of all, though, is the rampant alcoholism. It's a sad fact that native-Americans are genetically very susceptible to \textbf{alcohol} abuse, and alcoholism destroys everything. The Navajo tell their kids to leave the res, go out in the world, be successful, and then come back. Most of the Lakota who succeed follow the same path.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Nation, Red, alcohol & \cellcolor{green!27} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Behavioural Addiction - Alcohol, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - Native-American, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}5/330 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.515 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small As my Uncle says, if you want to know how the government will treat you...just look at the Native American. The Native Americans are our socialist society since they are not protected by the US Constitution and the government can take from them what they please without compensation.I understand why my great-grandfather would lie and say that he was Italian in order to get a job when he was a young man in the 1930s. My great-grandpa was Ojibwa (Chippewa) and he was born on one of the Michigan reservations in 1917. I heard stories about him going to the "\textbf{Indian}" reform schools and he had twisted fingers from them being broke by his teacher(s) in his boyhood. He worked odd jobs and even bootlegged booze for Al Capone for a short time when he was in his late teens. All worked out for him in the end, he met and married my great-grandma, who was the daughter of two Danish immigrants, and had 7 children with her. I guess that over the years he put on weight from my great-grandma's cooking and baking because it was so good. I was told that he really liked my great-great grandmother's breads, cakes, and pastries and when he told my great-grandma that, she got angry and went on a baking spree to prove that her baking was better than her mother's. After his marriage to my great-grandma, he was able to take a job as a tool and die maker in a factory and he worked there until he became ill with heart and lung issues. He had a bad smoking habit and I was told that he would binge drink occasionally. Now, I do not know if anyone outside the family knew that he was Native American or cared that he was Native because he made quite a few friends around the neighborhood. One neighbor even gave him a car when his \textbf{old} one broke down. He had a very no-nonsence attitude and he was very down to earth. My dad loved him and would sit out on the porch with him and listen to his advice and stories.My great-grandpa died in 1981 from complications of the heart.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Jhava Joe Most people had to do what they had to do back then. Even though Italians were also discriminated against in the work force back in those days, at least most Italians could find some type of work even if it wasn't a very good job. Other than Italians, the Irish, Chinese, and Polish were not looked upon favorably back in those days either. Sadly, it is just a fact of life and either you did your best to overcome the obstacles or just gave up and let it life take you down. Great-grandpa did not blame anyone for his mishaps or for his past...he just focused on the future and he despised victim mentality. He was also very wise and very observant. My dad told me a story once about him being a young teen and great-grandpa telling him, "The government is going to clip the wings of the eagle and no one will lift a finger to stop it." Dad always told me that if a Native tells you something than you best believe it because they are not wrong. You should chat with a Native in your area sometime...they are nice to talk to...at least the ones that I encountered were. I used to live near a reservation when I still lived in Michigan and occasionally the Natives would come to the store that I worked at and I would chat with them on my break.  I never went to the reservation because I did not believe that the tribal police would allow me on it. Despite have a great-grandfather who was Native, I am not registered with a tribe and I believe that they changed the laws years ago where you had to be registered with the tribe in order to go on the reservation. My great-Uncle lived with the Patowatami on their reservation, by Gun Lake, back in the mid or late 1970s but I guess that was alright then. My great-Uncle has the facial features of his father but blue eyes and blonde hair like his mother. Even my dad, as a teen, stayed on the Patowatami reservation for awhile. I was told that most of the Native girls had a crush on my dad because he was really tall, muscular, had striking big blue eyes and light brown hair. My dad really took after the Danish side, plus my dad's father was of British decent. Yes, I'll admit that there is some \textbf{racism} within the Native community but most are alright; however, I guess that can be seen in all racial groups and cultures around the world...you have your good and your bad. Personally, I just see people and I love my European side and my Native side equally. Both sides did great things and both sides did bad things in the past.

When she was 9 her Mother died, her white father abandoned the family. The children were given as servants(really slaves) to the farmers in the area. She work a farm for the next three years with only a blanket, and a dress(if you call call it that). Her sister and her shared a dirt floor storage shed to live in. The summer of her 12th year she fell picking apples.  Braking her back, some how they got he in the shed without killing or crippling her.

Trump, honestly, reminds me of a 1990s Democrat but it seems that we have shifted so far Left in the last few years or so, that anyone even slightly right of Stalin is a far-right extremist. They are also pissed that Trump is not PC and speaks his mind. Also, he is a businessman and not a Politician.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Mr Davs I don't need to ask immigrants why they leave their countries to go to places like the USA or UK. My parents were immigrants to the UK. The reason they left was not because they considered the UK to be a 'great' \textbf{nation}, it was because they saw no future in the \textbf{nation} they had left and at the time the UK was calling out for people the world over to live in Britain. I myself am technically an \textbf{immigrant} also. I left the UK to live in The Netherlands simply because I wanted to be physically closer to a bigger market - the EU for my work. The USA has more firearms in the hands of the public, than people. It is awash with weaponry and is of no surprise the USA is subjected to mass shootings virtually every week. I am quite sure many of the weapons available to the US public can in no way or form be suitable for just hunting - which is actually virtually banned here in the EU. As for 'rights', I am assuming you are referring to the ridiculous right to bear arms in your constitution. This amendment, the source of so much killing in the USA is not fit for purpose and should be scraped.  It was written into your constitution so that white men could arm themselves on the pretext of a rise of a tyrannical government - in spite of the fact genocide and slavery was already taking place in your country, so it beggars belief to know what 'tyrannical' really meant in their minds and against foreign foes.

Sure we are not perfect and we have our flaws like any other country, but we are much better off than most countries are. If you or anyone thinks that Immigrants don't come to our country because they don't think it's a great \textbf{nation} then you are fooling yourselves or you are big liars. As for Mass Shootings those are very rare crimes here in the United States, Mass shootings represent a very, very ,very tiny share of all shooting deaths here in America. You've been brainwashed to think that Mass Shootings happen all the time in the US and that lots and lots of people die from it ever year because we have the right to own guns it's just not true. A hell of a lot more shooting deaths come from drive-by shootings every year by gang-bangers and criminals with unregistered guns than mass shootings happening and making guns illegal here is not gonna make gun violence go away or make the murder rate go down in this country. If someone is going to kill someone they will kill someone with a gun or something else. You know in England homicides are at a record high for the past decade, knife crime is rising heavily there, so maybe we ought to ban knifes there? I don't think the people there should be allowed to have knifes in their household because too many people in the public there have knifes and there is so much killing going on there in those areas because of people owning knifes haha!

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Mr Davs On the contrary, I sincerly believe most people when they go to America have no thoughts of it being a 'great' \textbf{nation}. They are economic migrants for the most part interested in improving their standard of living. I'm very close to this issue because half of my own family left Jamaica to live in various parts of the USA and the idea of it being 'great' was not even on the table. However the assertion of the USA being a deep, anti \textbf{black}  \textbf{racist} \textbf{nation} was. Regardless, the lure of a higher standard of living outweighed any negative views of the USA for them. If on the other hand, in my opinion you are from a repressive place like the former Soviet block or Apartheid era South Africa etc, then yes I would agree that most people from these places would indeed think beyond a material aspect of going to the USA.  But there are also many other nations they could go to like that such as in the EU. As for mass shootings in the USA, I would have to vehmently disagree with you on this point. Even here in the EU we hear all the time of mass shootings in the USA. It is a very \textbf{common} event, an event you seem to be in denial of. Please refer to  [LINK] I would not at all be surprised if even more people are killed in 'drive by'  gang shootings. However the point is irrelevant. What is relevant however is that your gun laws are at this point in history is not fit for purpose and just leads to a massive, senseless lost of life. Yes,  you are correct about knife crime in the UK. I work in the UK (London), but live in The Netherlands. However comparing the absolute number of deaths or even a percentage of deaths between gun  knives in the USA and UK, it is quite obvious significantly more people in the USA die as a result of gun violence than knife related deaths in the UK. The city of Baltimore has been in the news recently. I was horrified to learn that deaths related to gun violence is over 300 per year. That is just under 1 person per day being shot dead and its a similar story for other US cities. In London death via knife is no where near that level and I have not even started talking about US cities like Chicago, Detroit.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black, Common, Nation, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Nationality - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!27}5/417 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.199 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small It must also be addressed as to whether the white man encroached upon and took possession of lands that were legally claimed by the \textbf{Indian}. The third maxim of International Law says we have to look at the \textbf{Indian}'s law, and that whatever measures or acts the white man took in regards to \textbf{Indian} land must be pursuant to \textbf{Indian} law. The following are some of the laws that were generally held by the Indians: 1. It was a law \textbf{common} among Indians that the stronger of two tribes or people (nations) has the right to conquer and subdue the weaker.2. Under \textbf{Indian} \textbf{common} law it was understood that land claims existed by inhabiting the land and by any use of the land.3. When any land was unoccupied or not used for one year, the land was free for anyone to claim and settle.This first law of the \textbf{Indian} could actually render all other arguments of land rights academic. This law was almost a way of life with the \textbf{Indian}, which is why they were always warring among themselves. The wars and conflicts between the white \textbf{race} and the \textbf{Indian} \textbf{race} throughout history were numerous, and the fact that the white \textbf{race} was the stronger cannot be doubted.According to the third \textbf{Indian} law listed, the white man, or any man or \textbf{nation}, had the right to possess the vast lands that were uninhabited or unclaimed by the \textbf{Indian} in America. Since the Indians never claimed the American continent from Atlantic to Pacific, the lands claimed by right of discovery are valid. Thus, the only legal conflict that can exist lies with the 3 of land the \textbf{Indian} had a legal claim to in America, in accordance to the second \textbf{Indian} law listed.In spite of the legal right the white \textbf{race} has to America, we often are confronted with the anti-American propaganda that the white \textbf{race} wronged the \textbf{Indian} by attacking and killing them and driving them out of their land. We thus need to look at the first conflicts that existed between the Indians and the colonial settlers. A summary of these first conflicts shows they were always initiated by Indians: •Shortly after the first colony was established at Jamestown in 1607, the settlers were attacked by the Indians, who wounded seventeen men and killed one boy.    •After the above conflict, peaceful relations prevailed, due to the wise policy of Captain John Smith and the good will of Powhatan, head chief of the \textbf{Indian} Confederacy. When Powhatan died in 1618, his brother Opechancanough, who disliked the English, began to plot war. In March 1622, the \textbf{Indian} tribes went on the warpath, and swept through a line of settlements marked by a trail of blood. In the white settlements, nearly 400 men, women, and children, were cruelly put to death before the ravages of the Indians could be checked. •For 22 years after the massacre of 1622 there was peace. But Opechancanouch, at last head chief, only waited for another opportunity. In 1644, there was a civil war in England, and he thought the expected moment was at hand. The massacre he waged left over 300 white settlers slain in two days. Again the whites took up arms in defense, and in 1646 the aged chief himself was taken and killed - there was never again a general uprising in Virginia. •In the Plymouth colony, a peace compact was established between the \textbf{Indian} chief Massasoit and Governor Carver. As time went on, the friendly \textbf{old} chief died. When his son, King Philip, came to be ruler of the Wampanoag tribe, trouble began to brew for the colonists. Urged on by his braves, King Philip began sending messages to friendly tribes, inviting them to join in a mighty war on the "pale faces." The war that followed was a terrible one. The Indians, avoiding the white troops, dodging them, and never meeting them face to face in the open field, carried on the contest in their savage way of massacring the helpless, and burning villages. Many a fair and quite settlement was made desolate. Women and children were ruthlessly murdered, and burned in the houses. But by the end of 1675 the force of the Indians was broken. •In the New Haven colony the situation with the Indians (the Pequets) was similar. At first there were peaceful relationships between them and the white settlers. During 1637, the Pequots attempted to organize a confederacy, but unable to secure the help of the Narragansetts due to the influence of Roger Williams, they took to the warpath alone. They did not come out in open battle, but waylaid a party of whites and killed thirty of them. In response to this, a small party of English, along with some seventy friendly Indians, attacked the Pequet stronghold, killing over 450 of that tribe. The great Pequet tribe was crushed, and nearly forty years of Peace ensued. History reveals that all the early hostilities and wars between the American Indians and the white settlers, were instigated or started by the Indians without just cause. Even though the white settlers had legal title to the land by way of purchase or claim of unoccupied lands, the \textbf{Indian} was always the one to disrupt peaceful relations with attacks, massacres, and wars. The retaliation by the white settlers were merely acts of self defense and self preservation in accordance with the law of nature. Thus it was the \textbf{Indian} who was the intruder and violator of land rights and of his own law. It was the \textbf{Indian} who, in the beginning, wronged the white man. The \textbf{Indian}'s treachery, barbaric and warlike manner, and sneak attacks on the colonists was positive proof of the anti-social nature of the \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} man. This exhibit of the \textbf{Indian}'s character caused much distrust of the \textbf{Indian}, and became the "code of conduct" which the \textbf{Indian} continued to live by and uphold in the future.Thus, the white \textbf{race} has a rightful and legal claim and title to America pursuant to international law, the \textbf{Indian}'s law, the law of nature, and by a combination thereof.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Common, Indian, Nation, Old, Race, Red & \cellcolor{green!5} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - General, Ethnicity - Native-American, Nationality - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}32/1024 & \cellcolor{green!5}3.125 \\  \hline

(Joosare chosen TOO but not by who people think) Comanches came in and took the land from the Apaches by war, Aztecs, Incas and Mayans all grew their empires by conquering lands from other tribes. The Tainos and Canib tribes fought over land. When Spain Defeated the Aztec empire, the did so with an army of 1,000 Spanish soldiers and 75,000 soldiers from the Tlaxcallans, Choulatecs and Totonac tribes.. The practice of claiming the land of conquered enemies extended well past the colonization of America. It wasn't until the conclusion of World War II in 1945 that western culture shunned the practice (and even then, the Soviet Union claimed Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Austria, and many other territories as part of their victory spoils). To claim 'whiteEuropeans' 'stole' America from the native tribes is to force the cultural norms of the past 50 years (that whiteEuropeans created) on events that happened hundreds of years earlier. That is just ignorant. steal-americaAnother problem I have with the 'Whitepeople stole America from the Natives' mentality is that it is insulting to NativeAmericans. It portrays them as ignorant fools easily duped by the evil white man. When, in fact, the brave NativeAmerican tribes fought hard, vicious battles to preserve their lands. The United States Census Bureau in 1894 counted over 40 wars involvingwhite' Americans and Native Americans between the years 1789 and 1846, which killed 19,000 whites and about 30,000 Indians. During these wars Native Americans committed atrocities against the white settlers. Slaughtering whole towns, raping, scalping, and murdering children were regular acts. During the Pontiacs War in 1764, 4 Delaware \textbf{Indian} Warriors entered a settlers log schoolhouse. There, they killed and scalped the teacher, and nine children. Two children were scalped, but survived their injuries, and 4 other children were taken prisoners. This is the first schoolmassacre on record in America (and it happened before America was even a \textbf{nation}). As you can see, to claim that NativeAmericans were peace loving nomads that were fooled by the whitepeople is just plain ignorant. If there is one thing we can learn from the Native Americans loss of land to white settlers, it is that we need to have tighter control over our immigration policies. The Native Americans believed that the firstEuropean settlers were just refugees trying to escape persecution in their homeland. They thought the American continent was large enough and the resources plentiful enough that they could share it with a few of these foreigners. But soon, these few turned into many, and the many demanded more. Soon the demands turned into violent conflicts, and the NativeAmericans were trapped in warfare with the new 'immigrants'. The colonists eventually conquered the Native Americans and claimed the land as spoils of war. History repeats itself, and if we are not wary these new waves of undocumented immigrants, and refugees will soon be waging war on us.

Most of the native tribes lived in harmony with the land and had a very strong spiritual connection, would it not be amazing if the whole world lived this way. Learn all the ways of the whites and Invaders so that you are wise when dealing with them but do not live as they do, they destroy everything. Do not get me wrong you cannot clump them all together nomore then all tribes can be clumped together for the actions of certain ones. It is time for Change remember your heritage and beliefs come together live, love and stand up, fight for what is right, there are many that will stand with you. Take a look at the laws and regulations on reservations and make changes to improve everything for all the people. Hunting, fishing the right way of life. The tribes were forced onto reservations, turn it into a place of Beauty of home of the right way of life. This world is a mess, getting worse everyday,why would anyone want to be a part of that, greed, corruption and just plain evil. Remember your ways turn the greed of them against them.

I actually use that term very lightly considering how much 'need' is really not needed. It's ironic how much money there is for scholarships for immigrants andHispanics, yet an Americanpatriot has to struggle through college.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Post that was sent to Thisstrategy is longer than most know: TheJooswere accused of conspiring with the Mooslimsacross the Mediterranean. "The ArabMoors were perceived as, and indeed were,a liberating force."(Stillman, p. 53) Theblack Mooslimswere greeted byJoos eager to aid them in administering the country. In many conquered towns the garrison was left in the hands of theJoos before the Mooslimsproceeded further north. Thus came the,"Golden \textbf{Age}" for SpanishJoos. The following quote is self-explanatory. It was written in 1912 by the CommunistJoo,Israel Cohen, taken from his book; 'A RacialProgram For The Twentieth Century', and entered into the Congressional Record on June 17, 1957, volume 103, page 8559: 'We must realize that our party's most powerful weapon isracial tensions. By propounding into the consciousness of the darkracesthat for centuries they have been oppressedbywhites, we can mold them to the program of the COMMUNISTPARTY. In America we will aim for subtle victory. While inflaming the Negrominority against theWhites, we will endeavor to instill in thewhites a guilt complex for their exploitation of theNegroes.This is what Trotsky, a Joo, was preparing theRussians for with the implementation of Communismwhich KarlMarx (author of the CommunistManifesto1848), another Joo, based on the BabylonianTalmud forGentiles: "We should turn Her(Russia) into a desert populated withwhiteNgers.

Because they are notmulticultural enough.Coins,arrowheads,ritual amulets, weapons, jewelery and weights that were kept in the past are now directly dumped into metal recycling bins upon discovery instead of being treasured and displayed.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small This is lying propoganda by((Them))UNs.The native Americans are not native to America at all can you just remember 'native' Americans derived from mongols in Eurasia they crossed the baring strait from Asia learn your history boy The so-called 'native' Americans have their chance to make America theirs but they lost the war America is not stolen it is conquered America is founded and built by Europeans and for Europeans America is a European country and it should stay that way.Comanches came in and took the land from the Apaches by war, Aztecs, Incas and Mayans all grew their empires by conquering lands from other tribes. The Tainos and Canib tribes fought over land. When Spain Defeated the Aztec empire, the did so with an army of 1,000 Spanish soldiers and 75,000 soldiers from the Tlaxcallans, Choulatecs and Totonac tribes.. The practice of claiming the land of conquered enemies extended well past the colonization of America. It wasn't until the conclusion of World War II in 1945 that western culture shunned the practice (and even then, the Soviet Union claimed Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Austria, and many other territories as part of their victory spoils). To claim 'white Europeans' 'stole' America from the native tribes is to force the cultural norms of the past 50 years (that white Europeans created) on events that happened hundreds of years earlier. That is just ignorant. steal-americaAnother problem I have with the 'White people stole America from the Natives' mentality is that it is insulting to Native Americans. It portrays them as ignorant fools easily duped by the evil white man. When, in fact, the brave Native American tribes fought hard, vicious battles to preserve their lands. The United States Census Bureau in 1894 counted over 40 wars involving 'white' Americans and Native Americans between the years 1789 and 1846, which killed 19,000 whites and about 30,000 Indians. During these wars Native Americans committed atrocities against the white settlers. Slaughtering whole towns, raping, scalping, and murdering children were regular acts. During the Pontiacs War in 1764, 4 Delaware \textbf{Indian} Warriors entered a settlers log schoolhouse. There, they killed and scalped the teacher, and nine children. Two children were scalped, but survived their injuries, and 4 other children were taken prisoners. This is the first school massacre on record in America (and it happened before America was even a \textbf{nation}). As you can see, to claim that Native Americans were peace loving nomads that were fooled by the white people is just plain ignorant. If there is one thing we can learn from the Native Americans loss of land to white settlers, it is that we need to have tighter control over our immigration policies. The Native Americans believed that the first European settlers were just refugees trying to escape persecution in their homeland. They thought the American continent was large enough and the resources plentiful enough that they could share it with a few of these foreigners. But soon, these few turned into many, and the many demanded more. Soon the demands turned into violent conflicts, and the Native Americans were trapped in warfare with the new 'immigrants'. The colonists eventually conquered the Native Americans and claimed the land as spoils of war. History repeats itself, and if we are not wary these new waves of undocumented immigrants, and refugees will soon be waging war on us. The native Americans are not native to America at all can you just remember 'native' Americans derived from mongols in Eurasia they crossed the baring strait from Asia learn your historySpain 694, Jews were accused of conspiring with the Muslims across the Mediterranean. "The Arab Moors were perceived as, and indeed were, a liberating force." (Stillman, p. 53) The (\textbf{Black}) Muslims were greeted by Jews eager to aid them in administering the country. In many conquered towns the garrison was left in the hands of the Jews before the Muslims proceeded further north. Thus came the, "Golden \textbf{Age}" for Spanish Jews. The following quote is self-explanatory. It was written in 1912 by the \textbf{Communist} Jew, Israel Cohen, taken from his book; ' A Racial Program For The Twentieth Century', and entered into the Congressional Record on June 17, 1957, volume 103, page 8559: 'We must realize that our party's most powerful weapon is racial tensions. By propounding into the consciousness of the dark races that for centuries they have been oppressed by whites, we can mold them to the program of the \textbf{COMMUNIST} PARTY. In America we will aim for subtle victory.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small It's not right for legal, law-abiding citizens and the men and women who have fought for this country to be treated as second-class citizens. And to the Liberals who insist on calling us a minority, give it up. Instead, we let them come here with their kids, grandparents, and extended family.  Not only that, they also manage to turn a 4-bedroom, 3-bath home into an apartment complex housing 3-4 families at a time.

I actually use that term very lightly considering how much 'need' is really not needed. It's ironic how much money there is for scholarships for immigrants andHispanics, yet an Americanpatriot has to struggle through college. Take for example my own father who, back in the day, was told by his high school counselor to give up the idea of receiving a scholarship unless he was an athletic superstar, simply because he was Caucasianwith no other \textbf{ethnic} background whatsoever.  Still, California GovernorBrown can't wait for his DREAMAct to be enacted.  Discriminationmuch?

The Tainos and Canib tribes fought over land. When Spain Defeated the Aztec empire, the did so with an army of 1,000 Spanish soldiers and 75,000 soldiers from the Tlaxcallans, Choulatecs and Totonac tribes.. The practice of claiming the land of conquered enemies extended well past the colonization of America. It wasn't until the conclusion of World War II in 1945 that western culture shunned the practice (and even then, the Soviet Union claimed Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Austria, and many other territories as part of their victory spoils). To claim 'white Europeans' 'stole' America from the native tribes is to force the cultural norms of the past 50 years (that white Europeans created) on events that happened hundreds of years earlier. That is just ignorant. steal-americaAnother problem I have with the 'White people stole America from the Natives' mentality is that it is insulting to Native Americans. It portrays them as ignorant fools easily duped by the evil white man. When, in fact, the brave Native American tribes fought hard, vicious battles to preserve their lands. The United States Census Bureau in 1894 counted over 40 wars involving 'white' Americans and Native Americans between the years 1789 and 1846, which killed 19,000 whites and about 30,000 Indians. During these wars Native Americans committed atrocities against the white settlers. Slaughtering whole towns, raping, scalping, and murdering children were regular acts. During the Pontiacs War in 1764, 4 Delaware \textbf{Indian} Warriors entered a settlers log schoolhouse. There, they killed and scalped the teacher, and nine children. Two children were scalped, but survived their injuries, and 4 other children were taken prisoners. This is the first school massacre on record in America (and it happened before America was even a \textbf{nation}). As you can see, to claim that Native Americans were peace loving nomads that were fooled by the white people is just plain ignorant. If there is one thing we can learn from the Native Americans loss of land to white settlers, it is that we need to have tighter control over our immigration policies. The Native Americans believed that the first European settlers were just refugees trying to escape persecution in their homeland. They thought the American continent was large enough and the resources plentiful enough that they could share it with a few of these foreigners. But soon, these few turned into many, and the many demanded more. Soon the demands turned into violent conflicts, and the Native Americans were trapped in warfare with the new 'immigrants'. The colonists eventually conquered the Native Americans and claimed the land as spoils of war. History repeats itself, and if we are not wary these new waves of undocumented immigrants, and refugees will soon be waging war on us. The native Americans are not native to America at all can you just remember 'native' Americans derived from mongols in Eurasia they crossed the baring strait from Asia learn your historySpain 694, Joos were accused of conspiring with the Muslims across the Mediterranean.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small America was not stolen. America was conquered. There is a big difference. If you don't understand that simple fact then I suggest you go research and learn about World History. It's not nice, it's not pretty, but it's reality. If you are going to cry about being conquered them go do something about it and stop crying. Also, if you think native Americans were living in peace with no issues here before Europeans came then once again go research. If Spaniards took land from one tribe, and that tribe had took that land from another tribe and another other tribe had taken that land from ANOTHER tribe then who has true ownership of that land? How can it be determined who should get that land? Who were the true bad people of this situation? Example: There were Central American tribes that did HORRIFIC things to other tribes and "stole" their land and raped their women and enslaved the men. But what the \textbf{common} uneducated belief is that they were all living here dancing with the animals and helping each other and living in total peace until those darn Europeans came and "stole" the land. PLEASE people, go get educated. Research, question, and analyze. You will find that every single culture or \textbf{race} has had times when they they were the victims and times when they were the antagonists.   PLEASE get educated. Also, since every culture or \textbf{race} has been victimized or oppressed at one time or another then NO ONE wants to hear you whine or cry. Go do something about it or stop complaining. ALSO BEFORE YOU START CALLING ME NAMES AND ASSUMING MY AFFILIATION, \textbf{RACE} OR CULTURE... I AM OF SPANISH AND NATIVE AMERICAN BLOOD. I DON'T HATE EITHER GROUP NOR DO I HATE ANY GROUP.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Wrong. When the Europeans came to the new land,  they were called settlers.  The American Indians were settlers also,  living off the land but they never established a country. There were many American \textbf{Indian} tribes.  Each tribe living separately. The Europeans and Asians have established countries for thousands of years and have conquered other countries for thousands of years thousands of years but the American Indians have never established a country to call their own. The tribes never united.Certain steps are necessary in order to establish a country - having a government with laws and having the ability to defend the land from domestic insurrection and foreign invasion. The American Indians consisting of many tribes didn't do any of that. The tribes were just that - tribes, with no cohesive unit. There have been many treaties with good intentions and many treaties were broken.  There is no excuse for breaking the treaties but might is right in war and having dominion over the land; and might has been right since the beginning of human civilization.I feel sorry for the American Indians but I don't think much else can be done to fix the problem, because Americans won't allow the break up of America to the American Indians.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Indian & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Native-American & \cellcolor{green!5}1/209 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.478 \\  \hline

Yes, some lands were taken by the white man, but the same was going on amongst the Indians long before the white man showed up. So why no grievance about Indians taking lands amongst themselves, not to mention land they took from the white man? Why no grievances from the left for the evil atrocities they committed against innocent white settlers? Women and children who were tortured and killed in the most horrific ways.

When Spain Defeated the Aztec empire, the did so with an army of 1,000 Spanish soldiers and 75,000 soldiers from the Tlaxcallans, Choulatecs and Totonac tribes.. The practice of claiming the land of conquered enemies extended well past the colonization of America. It wasn't until the conclusion of World War II in 1945 that western culture shunned the practice (and even then, the Soviet Union claimed Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Austria, and many other territories as part of their victory spoils). To claim 'white Europeans' 'stole' America from the native tribes is to force the cultural norms of the past 50 years (that white Europeans created) on events that happened hundreds of years earlier. That is just ignorant. steal-americaAnother problem I have with the 'White people stole America from the Natives' mentality is that it is insulting to Native Americans. It portrays them as ignorant fools easily duped by the evil white man. When, in fact, the brave Native American tribes fought hard, vicious battles to preserve their lands. The United States Census Bureau in 1894 counted over 40 wars involving 'white' Americans and Native Americans between the years 1789 and 1846, which killed 19,000 whites and about 30,000 Indians. During these wars Native Americans committed atrocities against the white settlers. Slaughtering whole towns, raping, scalping, and murdering children were regular acts. During the Pontiacs War in 1764, 4 Delaware \textbf{Indian} Warriors entered a settlers log schoolhouse. There, they killed and scalped the teacher, and nine children. Two children were scalped, but survived their injuries, and 4 other children were taken prisoners. This is the first school massacre on record in America (and it happened before America was even a \textbf{nation}). As you can see, to claim that Native Americans were peace loving nomads that were fooled by the white people is just plain ignorant. If there is one thing we can learn from the Native Americans loss of land to white settlers, it is that we need to have tighter control over our immigration policies. The Native Americans believed that the first European settlers were just refugees trying to escape persecution in their homeland. They thought the American continent was large enough and the resources plentiful enough that they could share it with a few of these foreigners. But soon, these few turned into many, and the many demanded more. Soon the demands turned into violent conflicts, and the Native Americans were trapped in warfare with the new 'immigrants'. The colonists eventually conquered the Native Americans and claimed the land as spoils of war. History repeats itself, and if we are not wary these new waves of undocumented immigrants, and refugees will soon be waging war on us. The native Americans are not native to America at all can you just remember 'native' Americans derived from mongols in Eurasia they crossed the baring strait from Asia learn your history boy The so-called 'native' Americans have their chance to make America theirs but they lost the war AmericWhat schools wont teach and what someone whos great grandmother was \textbf{indian} and great grandfather irish also mentioned:Spanish, portuguese and joomigration to america and the term Marrano and the slave trade of central and southern americas. anglosaxons had little to do with any of this to.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The native Americans are not native to America at all can you just remember 'native' Americans derived from mongols in Eurasia they crossed the baring strait from Asia learn your history boy The so-called 'native' Americans have their chance to make America theirs but they lost the war America is not stolen it is conquered America is founded and built by Europeans and for Europeans America is a European country and it should stay that way.Comanches came in and took the land from the Apaches by war, Aztecs, Incas and Mayans all grew their empires by conquering lands from other tribes. The Tainos and Canib tribes fought over land. When Spain Defeated the Aztec empire, the did so with an army of 1,000 Spanish soldiers and 75,000 soldiers from the Tlaxcallans, Choulatecs and Totonac tribes.. The practice of claiming the land of conquered enemies extended well past the colonization of America. It wasn't until the conclusion of World War II in 1945 that western culture shunned the practice (and even then, the Soviet Union claimed Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Austria, and many other territories as part of their victory spoils). To claim 'white Europeans' 'stole' America from the native tribes is to force the cultural norms of the past 50 years (that white Europeans created) on events that happened hundreds of years earlier. That is just ignorant. steal-americaAnother problem I have with the 'White people stole America from the Natives' mentality is that it is insulting to Native Americans. It portrays them as ignorant fools easily duped by the evil white man. When, in fact, the brave Native American tribes fought hard, vicious battles to preserve their lands. The United States Census Bureau in 1894 counted over 40 wars involving 'white' Americans and Native Americans between the years 1789 and 1846, which killed 19,000 whites and about 30,000 Indians. During these wars Native Americans committed atrocities against the white settlers. Slaughtering whole towns, raping, scalping, and murdering children were regular acts. During the Pontiacs War in 1764, 4 Delaware \textbf{Indian} Warriors entered a settlers log schoolhouse. There, they killed and scalped the teacher, and nine children. Two children were scalped, but survived their injuries, and 4 other children were taken prisoners. This is the first school massacre on record in America (and it happened before America was even a \textbf{nation}). As you can see, to claim that Native Americans were peace loving nomads that were fooled by the white people is just plain ignorant. If there is one thing we can learn from the Native Americans loss of land to white settlers, it is that we need to have tighter control over our immigration policies. The Native Americans believed that the first European settlers were just refugees trying to escape persecution in their homeland. They thought the American continent was large enough and the resources plentiful enough that they could share it with a few of these foreigners. But soon, these few turned into many, and the many demanded more. Soon the demands turned into violent conflicts, and the Native Americans were trapped in warfare with the new 'immigrants'.

In many conquered towns the garrison was left in the hands of the Joos before the Muslims proceeded further north. Thus came the, "Golden \textbf{Age}" for Spanish Joos.

By propounding into the consciousness of the dark races that for centuries they have been oppressed by whites, we can mold them to the program of the \textbf{COMMUNIST} PARTY.

While inflaming the \textbf{Negro} minority against the Whites, we will endeavor to instill in the whites a guilt complex for their exploitation of the Negroes.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Rene Medina America was not stolen. America was conquered. There is a big difference. If you don't understand that simple fact then I suggest you go research and learn about World History. It's not nice, it's not pretty, but it's reality. If you are going to cry about being conquered them go do something about it and stop crying. Also, if you think native Americans were living in peace with no issues here before Europeans came then once again go research. If Spaniards took land from one tribe, and that tribe had took that land from another tribe and another other tribe had taken that land from ANOTHER tribe then who has true ownership of that land? How can it be determined who should get that land? Who were the true bad people of this situation? Example: There were Central American tribes that did HORRIFIC things to other tribes and "stole" their land and raped their women and enslaved the men. But what the \textbf{common} uneducated belief is that they were all living here dancing with the animals and helping each other and living in total peace until those darn Europeans came and "stole" the land. PLEASE people, go get educated. Research, question, and analyze. You will find that every single culture or \textbf{race} has had times when they they were the victims and times when they were the antagonists.   PLEASE get educated. Also, since every culture or \textbf{race} has been victimized or oppressed at one time or another then NO ONE wants to hear you whine or cry. Go do something about it or stop complaining. ALSO BEFORE YOU START CALLING ME NAMES AND ASSUMING MY AFFILIATION, \textbf{RACE} OR CULTURE... I AM OF SPANISH AND NATIVE AMERICAN BLOOD. I DON'T HATE EITHER GROUP NOR DO I HATE ANY GROUP.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The native Americans are not native to America at all can you just remember 'native' Americans derived from mongols in Eurasia they crossed the baring strait from Asia learn your history boy The so-called 'native' Americans have their chance to make America theirs but they lost the war America is not stolen it is conquered America is founded and built by Europeans and for Europeans America is a European country and it should stay that way.Comanches came in and took the land from the Apaches by war, Aztecs, Incas and Mayans all grew their empires by conquering lands from other tribes. The Tainos and Canib tribes fought over land. When Spain Defeated the Aztec empire, the did so with an army of 1,000 Spanish soldiers and 75,000 soldiers from the Tlaxcallans, Choulatecs and Totonac tribes.. The practice of claiming the land of conquered enemies extended well past the colonization of America. It wasn't until the conclusion of World War II in 1945 that western culture shunned the practice (and even then, the Soviet Union claimed Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Austria, and many other territories as part of their victory spoils). To claim 'white Europeans' 'stole' America from the native tribes is to force the cultural norms of the past 50 years (that white Europeans created) on events that happened hundreds of years earlier. That is just ignorant. steal-americaAnother problem I have with the 'White people stole America from the Natives' mentality is that it is insulting to Native Americans. It portrays them as ignorant fools easily duped by the evil white man. When, in fact, the brave Native American tribes fought hard, vicious battles to preserve their lands. The United States Census Bureau in 1894 counted over 40 wars involving 'white' Americans and Native Americans between the years 1789 and 1846, which killed 19,000 whites and about 30,000 Indians. During these wars Native Americans committed atrocities against the white settlers. Slaughtering whole towns, raping, scalping, and murdering children were regular acts. During the Pontiacs War in 1764, 4 Delaware \textbf{Indian} Warriors entered a settlers log schoolhouse. There, they killed and scalped the teacher, and nine children. Two children were scalped, but survived their injuries, and 4 other children were taken prisoners. This is the first school massacre on record in America (and it happened before America was even a \textbf{nation}). As you can see, to claim that Native Americans were peace loving nomads that were fooled by the white people is just plain ignorant. If there is one thing we can learn from the Native Americans loss of land to white settlers, it is that we need to have tighter control over our immigration policies. The Native Americans believed that the first European settlers were just refugees trying to escape persecution in their homeland. They thought the American continent was large enough and the resources plentiful enough that they could share it with a few of these foreigners. But soon, these few turned into many, and the many demanded more. Soon the demands turned into violent conflicts, and the Native Americans were trapped in warfare with the new 'immigrants'. The colonists eventually conquered the Native Americans and claimed the land as spoils of war. History repeats itself, and if we are not wary these new waves of undocumented immigrants, and refugees will soon be waging war on us.

(Stillman, p. 53) The (\textbf{Black}) Muslims were greeted by Jews eager to aid them in administering the country. In many conquered towns the garrison was left in the hands of the Jews before the Muslims proceeded further north. Thus came the, "Golden \textbf{Age}" for Spanish Jews. The following quote is self-explanatory. It was written in 1912 by the \textbf{Communist} Jew, Israel Cohen, taken from his book; ' A Racial Program For The Twentieth Century', and entered into the Congressional Record on June 17, 1957, volume 103, page 8559: 'We must realize that our party's most powerful weapon is racial tensions. By propounding into the consciousness of the dark races that for centuries they have been oppressed by whites, we can mold them to the program of the \textbf{COMMUNIST} PARTY. In America we will aim for subtle victory. While inflaming the \textbf{Negro} minority against the Whites, we will endeavor to instill in the whites a guilt complex for their exploitation of the Negroes. We will aid the Negroes to rise in prominence in every walk of life, in the professions and in the world of sports and entertainment. With this prestige, the \textbf{Negro} will be able to intermarry with the whites and begin a process which will deliver America to our cause.' ~ Israel Cohen This is what Trotsky, a Jew, was preparing the Russians for with the implementation of Communism, which Karl Marx (author of the \textbf{Communist} Manifesto 1848), another Jew, based on the Babylonian Talmud for Gentiles: "We should turn Her (Russia) into a desert populated with white N*ggers. We will impose upon them such a tyranny that was never dreamt by the most hideous despots of the East. The peculiar trait of that tyranny is that it will be enacted from the left rather than the right and it will be \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} rather than white in color.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The Americas were originally \textbf{Indian} land, but since Columbus discovered the New World, a large number of whites have poured in. In the Americas, especially the United States, Indians have been devastated.  This set of photographs was taken in 1890, the last organized killing of Indians by the US government. There were originally 80 million Indians in the Americas, more than 10 million in the United States, and today the number has dropped to 4 million and 200,000 respectively. Before the founding of the United States, colonists and Protestants from Europe and the United Kingdom slaughtered the Indians. The British colonists released the rewards of the \textbf{Indian} scalp in the name of the Queen. This was \textbf{nothing} more than slaughtering the land and plundering the land. The United States, which pursues freedom, equality, and human rights, was killed by the Indians at the beginning of the founding of the country. The primary task of the US Army to build troops was to expand westward and slaughter the Indians. Most of the people who carry out these cruel policies are American democratic leaders, including the third president of the United States, Thomas Jefferson, who advocates "natural human rights."  He ordered the US military to take land from the west, and if the Indians resisted, they slaughtered.  He said: "In war, they may kill some of us, but we will kill them all." The United States has also issued a reward order for Indians. The law stipulates that every time a \textbf{Indian} man (whether men, women, children, or even babies) is handed over, the US government will issue a bonus of 50-100 dollars (killing Indians under the \textbf{age} of 12).  Infants and Killing Female Indians award \$50, killing young men and women over the \textbf{age} of 12 for \$100.) After the American Civil War, according to the US President Lincoln's Homestead Act, Americans moved westward, and many \textbf{Indian} villages became ghosts overnight.  With the cooperation of the militia, the regular US military launched more than 1,000 actions of different scales for the Indians. By 1890, the extermination of the Indians was basically completed. In 1862, President Lincoln ordered the tying of 38 chiefs of the Dakota-Sultan tribe in the Mankato region of Minnesota.  Most of these hanged people are clergy and political leaders of their tribe.  None of these chiefs have committed crimes accused by the US government. American soldiers are burying the bodies of Indians killed by them Many American historians have defended the American slaughter of Indians, but these actions are difficult to cover up.  Hitler's concentration camp killed one-third of the Jews, while the United States killed almost all American Indians.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Indian, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Native-American & \cellcolor{green!5}7/442 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.584 \\  \hline

Okay how is that statement \textbf{racist} or do you consider the truth to be \textbf{racist}? Let's break this down with historical facts. What happened when Columbus landed in the New World, did he not steal the Natives opening up slavery in the New World when he did not find the gold he thought he would fine or the spices? Did the Spanish not steal 181 tons of gold and 16,000 tons of silver from the New World. And latter the stolen labor of enslaved Africans. Now lets talk about the English and French, how much labor did they steal from enslaved Africans before the revolutionary war? Now lets talk about the newly formed United States, how much labor did the newly formed country steal from enslaved Africans? The truth is this and no one ever wants to admit it, there is not a continent on this planet when Europeans set foot, where destruction of indigenous culture did not occur, these are facts not mere subjective opinions. You and everyone else call it expansion, but the people that were encountered call it theft. So no its not \textbf{racist}, these are facts, in fact there are very few treaties with the Native Americans that US government has honored, when something valuable is discovered from gold and silver mines of South West or to the \textbf{Black} Hills if something of value is found on the land well the Native population had to be moved. Again these are facts, not just opinions, in fact from 1778 to 1871 there has been 500 treaties made with Native Americans and all of them have been broken by the US government and only one was broken by Native Americans again facts.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Nina Chistian America was not stolen. America was conquered. There is a big difference. If you don't understand that simple fact then I suggest you go research and learn about World History. It's not nice, it's not pretty, but it's reality. If you are going to cry about being conquered them go do something about it and stop crying. Also, if you think native Americans were living in peace with no issues here before Europeans came then once again go research. If Spaniards took land from one tribe, and that tribe had took that land from another tribe and another other tribe had taken that land from ANOTHER tribe then who has true ownership of that land? How can it be determined who should get that land? Who were the true bad people of this situation? Example: There were Central American tribes that did HORRIFIC things to other tribes and "stole" their land and raped their women and enslaved the men. But what the \textbf{common} uneducated belief is that they were all living here dancing with the animals and helping each other and living in total peace until those darn Europeans came and "stole" the land. PLEASE people, go get educated. Research, question, and analyze. You will find that every single culture or \textbf{race} has had times when they they were the victims and times when they were the antagonists.   PLEASE get educated. Also, since every culture or \textbf{race} has been victimized or oppressed at one time or another then NO ONE wants to hear you whine or cry. Go do something about it or stop complaining.

The Tainos and Canib tribes fought over land. When Spain Defeated the Aztec empire, the did so with an army of 1,000 Spanish soldiers and 75,000 soldiers from the Tlaxcallans, Choulatecs and Totonac tribes.. The practice of claiming the land of conquered enemies extended well past the colonization of America. It wasn't until the conclusion of World War II in 1945 that western culture shunned the practice (and even then, the Soviet Union claimed Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Austria, and many other territories as part of their victory spoils). To claim 'white Europeans' 'stole' America from the native tribes is to force the cultural norms of the past 50 years (that white Europeans created) on events that happened hundreds of years earlier. That is just ignorant. steal-americaAnother problem I have with the 'White people stole America from the Natives' mentality is that it is insulting to Native Americans. It portrays them as ignorant fools easily duped by the evil white man. When, in fact, the brave Native American tribes fought hard, vicious battles to preserve their lands. The United States Census Bureau in 1894 counted over 40 wars involving 'white' Americans and Native Americans between the years 1789 and 1846, which killed 19,000 whites and about 30,000 Indians. During these wars Native Americans committed atrocities against the white settlers. Slaughtering whole towns, raping, scalping, and murdering children were regular acts. During the Pontiacs War in 1764, 4 Delaware \textbf{Indian} Warriors entered a settlers log schoolhouse. There, they killed and scalped the teacher, and nine children. Two children were scalped, but survived their injuries, and 4 other children were taken prisoners. This is the first school massacre on record in America (and it happened before America was even a \textbf{nation}). As you can see, to claim that Native Americans were peace loving nomads that were fooled by the white people is just plain ignorant. If there is one thing we can learn from the Native Americans loss of land to white settlers, it is that we need to have tighter control over our immigration policies. The Native Americans believed that the first European settlers were just refugees trying to escape persecution in their homeland. They thought the American continent was large enough and the resources plentiful enough that they could share it with a few of these foreigners. But soon, these few turned into many, and the many demanded more. Soon the demands turned into violent conflicts, and the Native Americans were trapped in warfare with the new 'immigrants'. The colonists eventually conquered the Native Americans and claimed the land as spoils of war. History repeats itself, and if we are not wary these new waves of undocumented immigrants, and refugees will soon be waging war on us.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Spain 694, Jews were accused of conspiring with the Muslims across the Mediterranean. "The Arab Moors were perceived as, and indeed were, a liberating force." (Stillman, p. 53) The (\textbf{Black}) Muslims were greeted by Jews eager to aid them in administering the country. In many conquered towns the garrison was left in the hands of the Jews before the Muslims proceeded further north. Thus came the, "Golden \textbf{Age}" for Spanish Jews. The following quote is self-explanatory. It was written in 1912 by the \textbf{Communist} Jew, Israel Cohen, taken from his book; ' A Racial Program For The Twentieth Century', and entered into the Congressional Record on June 17, 1957, volume 103, page 8559: 'We must realize that our party's most powerful weapon is racial tensions. By propounding into the consciousness of the dark races that for centuries they have been oppressed by whites, we can mold them to the program of the \textbf{COMMUNIST} PARTY. In America we will aim for subtle victory. While inflaming the \textbf{Negro} minority against the Whites, we will endeavor to instill in the whites a guilt complex for their exploitation of the Negroes. We will aid the Negroes to rise in prominence in every walk of life, in the professions and in the world of sports and entertainment. With this prestige, the \textbf{Negro} will be able to intermarry with the whites and begin a process which will deliver America to our cause.' ~ Israel Cohen This is what Trotsky, a Jew, was preparing the Russians for with the implementation of Communism, which Karl Marx (author of the \textbf{Communist} Manifesto 1848), another Jew, based on the Babylonian Talmud for Gentiles: "We should turn Her (Russia) into a desert populated with white N*ggers. We will impose upon them such a tyranny that was never dreamt by the most hideous despots of the East. The peculiar trait of that tyranny is that it will be enacted from the left rather than the right and it will be \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} rather than white in color.

It would probably be easier for you to create your socialist utopia amongst the 'poor and helpless' Mexican natives.course the U.S. isn't just going to throw the parents and family of the child born within American borders back to Mexico!  Instead, we let them come here with their kids, grandparents, and extended family.  Not only that, they also manage to turn a 4-bedroom, 3-bath home into an apartment complex housing 3-4 families at a time.

Just because you think you have some claim to land does not mean you have claim to the cities and towns that were built by Europeans. That includes cities like Los Angeles that were founded by the Spanish and built by other Europeans.  If it was about land you'd be fine going out into the middle of nowhere and building a town or city for yourselves since you seem to be \textbf{racist}. So either we're a multicultural country that can dicate laws no matter the \textbf{race} of the citizen or you're a supremacist that thinks white people don't belong here. Do you guys even think about the shit you chime in on? For some reason you strike me as being a muppet and full of hate. Its not hateful to have immigration law btw, we can dictate who comes in but you guys don't want that because you have an obsession with turning the US into Mexico, why would you want to go backwards like that is my question.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Jay Kemme Comanches came in and took the land from the Apaches by war, Aztecs, Incas and Mayans all grew their empires by conquering lands from other tribes. The Tainos and Canib tribes fought over land. When Spain Defeated the Aztec empire, the did so with an army of 1,000 Spanish soldiers and 75,000 soldiers from the Tlaxcallans, Choulatecs and Totonac tribes.. The practice of claiming the land of conquered enemies extended well past the colonization of America. It wasn't until the conclusion of World War II in 1945 that western culture shunned the practice (and even then, the Soviet Union claimed Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Austria, and many other territories as part of their victory spoils). To claim 'whiteEuropeans' 'stole' America from the native tribes is to force the cultural norms of the past 50 years (that whiteEuropeans created) on events that happened hundreds of years earlier. That is just ignorant. steal-americaAnother problem I have with the 'Whitepeople stole America from the Natives' mentality is that it is insulting to NativeAmericans. It portrays them as ignorant fools easily duped by the evil white man. When, in fact, the brave NativeAmerican tribes fought hard, vicious battles to preserve their lands. The United States Census Bureau in 1894 counted over 40 wars involvingwhite' Americans and Native Americans between the years 1789 and 1846, which killed 19,000 whites and about 30,000 Indians. During these wars Native Americans committed atrocities against the white settlers. Slaughtering whole towns, raping, scalping, and murdering children were regular acts. During the Pontiacs War in 1764, 4 Delaware \textbf{Indian} Warriors entered a settlers log schoolhouse. There, they killed and scalped the teacher, and nine children. Two children were scalped, but survived their injuries, and 4 other children were taken prisoners. This is the first schoolmassacre on record in America (and it happened before America was even a \textbf{nation}). As you can see, to claim that NativeAmericans were peace loving nomads that were fooled by the whitepeople is just plain ignorant. If there is one thing we can learn from the Native Americans loss of land to white settlers, it is that we need to have tighter control over our immigration policies. The Native Americans believed that the firstEuropean settlers were just refugees trying to escape persecution in their homeland. They thought the American continent was large enough and the resources plentiful enough that they could share it with a few of these foreigners. But soon, these few turned into many, and the many demanded more. Soon the demands turned into violent conflicts, and the NativeAmericans were trapped in warfare with the new 'immigrants'. The colonists eventually conquered the Native Americans and claimed the land as spoils of war. History repeats itself, and if we are not wary these new waves of undocumented immigrants, and refugees will soon be waging war on us. The native Americans are not native to America at all can you just remember 'native' Americans derived from mongols in Eurasia they crossed the baring strait from Asia learn your history boy The so-called 'native' Americans have their chance to make America theirs but they lost the war America.The native Americans are not native to America at all can you just remember 'native' Americans derived frommongols inEurasia they crossed the baring strait from Asia learn your history boy The so-called 'native' Americans have their chance to make America theirs but they lost the war America is not stolen it is conquered America is founded and built by Europeans and for Europeans America is a European country and it should stay that way.Thisstrategy is longer than most know: TheJooswere accused of conspiring with the Mooslimsacross the Mediterranean. "The ArabMoors were perceived as, and indeed were,a liberating force."(Stillman, p. 53) Theblack Mooslimswere greeted byJoos eager to aid them in administering the country. In many conquered towns the garrison was left in the hands of theJoos before the Mooslimsproceeded further north. Thus came the,"Golden \textbf{Age}" for SpanishJoos. The following quote is self-explanatory. It was written in 1912 by the CommunistJoo,Israel Cohen, taken from his book; 'A RacialProgram For The Twentieth Century', and entered into the Congressional Record on June 17, 1957, volume 103, page 8559: 'We must realize that our party's most powerful weapon isracial tensions. By propounding into the consciousness of the darkracesthat for centuries they have been oppressedbywhites, we can mold them to the program of the COMMUNISTPARTY. In America we will aim for subtle victory. While inflaming the Negrominority against theWhites, we will endeavor to instill in thewhites a guilt complex for their exploitation of theNegroes.This is what Trotsky, a Joo, was preparing theRussians for with the for with the implementation of Communismwhich KarlMarx (author of the CommunistManifesto1848), another Joo, based on the BabylonianTalmud forGentiles: "We should turn Her(Russia) into a desert populated withwhiteNgers.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I identify more with my European ancestry, but I have strong DNA markers from Cherokee and Algonquin from Canada. My problem with all of this is the absolute defeatism encountered when dealing with our native tribes. Yes, land is stolen. Yes, every agreement was broken. Yes, there were horrible, forced displacements. But, in spite of all that, this country offers a chance to everyone - including members of native peoples. The worst thing to happen is institutionalized welfare. IMHO crime, abuse, drug abuse, etc are worse than in the inner cities. Anytime we live apart, cut off from th mainstream of society we run big risks. All the \textbf{crazy} religious sects, including Hasidic Jews and Amish, etc are \textbf{nothing} more than conversation topics. I remember reading about Iroqouis tribes and others from the eastern confederations adapting to the White Man's world. The ancient manhood test of climbing dangerous heights became an opportunity for the new men to become some of the best steel workers in the new cities of the last 150 years. Most tribes simply gave up, and my question as a descendant of some of these people is: where is the pride in that? Where is the pride in killing whales (as part of a native hunt in Puget Sound!) with outboard motors and high-powered rifles? Where is the Inuit pride in decimating hundreds and thousands of seals with ak-47s? Where is the Native pride in all the babies born with fetal \textbf{alcohol} syndrome? All the girls raped by relatives because no one knows, no one cares? Where is the self-discipline once so mastered? Where is the respect for nature in reservations littered with refrigerators, RVs and snowmobiles? Where? Native culture is dead, because the White man gave you a hand-out, and you took it! The welfare check is more deadly than Jackson's infected blankets! The Native people have so much to offer, and we never see it because everyone stays cocooned up on the rez. When I see native boys in bomber jackets selling heroin in Washington state, listening to rap music,  I only want to tell them that they are the nails in the coffin of Native America. No one with pride betrays his culture that way. It is why Europeans will always determine the path of this \textbf{nation}, whether we like it or not.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The first people to have discovered and lived in the Americas were the Solutrians who began to arrive in North America as far back as 50,000 years ago. They were an ice \textbf{age} people from what is now Spain and France. They came in seal skin boats along the edge of the Atlantic glaciers during the Wisconsinin period of glaciation. The currents along the ice ran east to west, and west to east far off shore, so they did not even have to paddle their way here and back. They first arrived in northern Virginia, and 20,000+ years ago had settlements all along Chesapeake Bay. Oyster fishermen in the bay and off shore at sea routinely dredge up mammoth bones with Solutrian style spear points in them (the oceans were about 150 meter lower then due to the continental ice sheets). They make a good living selling these artifacts. Off the west coast of Europe, many fishermen have given up fishing to dredge up mammoth bones to sell. A now retired researcher from the Smithsonian Institute, Dr. Dennis Stanford, has pursued this subject for most of his life and has written many scientific papers and books on the subject. You can find his videos on You Tube. White people were here first, but their numbers were decimated by the impact event that created the Carolina Bays land formations. Large Fauna like horses went extinct from this, but the Solutrians survived in small numbers, only to be exterminated by the late coming Mongolians who created the "Native Americans".

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Comanches came in and took the land from the Apaches by war, Aztecs, Incas and Mayans all grew their empires by conquering lands from other tribes. The Tainos and Canib tribes fought over land. When Spain Defeated the Aztec empire, the did so with an army of 1,000 Spanish soldiers and 75,000 soldiers from the Tlaxcallans, Choulatecs and Totonac tribes.. The practice of claiming the land of conquered enemies extended well past the colonization of America. It wasn't until the conclusion of World War II in 1945 that western culture shunned the practice (and even then, the Soviet Union claimed Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Austria, and many other territories as part of their victory spoils). To claim 'whiteEuropeans' 'stole' America from the native tribes is to force the cultural norms of the past 50 years (that whiteEuropeans created) on events that happened hundreds of years earlier. That is just ignorant. steal-americaAnother problem I have with the 'Whitepeople stole America from the Natives' mentality is that it is insulting to NativeAmericans. It portrays them as ignorant fools easily duped by the evil white man. When, in fact, the brave NativeAmerican tribes fought hard, vicious battles to preserve their lands. The United States Census Bureau in 1894 counted over 40 wars involvingwhite' Americans and Native Americans between the years 1789 and 1846, which killed 19,000 whites and about 30,000 Indians. During these wars Native Americans committed atrocities against the white settlers. Slaughtering whole towns, raping, scalping, and murdering children were regular acts. During the Pontiacs War in 1764, 4 Delaware \textbf{Indian} Warriors entered a settlers log schoolhouse. There, they killed and scalped the teacher, and nine children. Two children were scalped, but survived their injuries, and 4 other children were taken prisoners. This is the first schoolmassacre on record in America (and it happened before America was even a \textbf{nation}). As you can see, to claim that NativeAmericans were peace loving nomads that were fooled by the whitepeople is just plain ignorant. If there is one thing we can learn from the Native Americans loss of land to white settlers, it is that we need to have tighter control over our immigration policies. The Native Americans believed that the firstEuropean settlers were just refugees trying to escape persecution in their homeland. They thought the American continent was large enough and the resources plentiful enough that they could share it with a few of these foreigners. But soon, these few turned into many, and the many demanded more. Soon the demands turned into violent conflicts, and the NativeAmericans were trapped in warfare with the new 'immigrants'. The colonists eventually conquered the Native Americans and claimed the land as spoils of war. History repeats itself, and if we are not wary these new waves of undocumented immigrants, and refugees will soon be waging war on us. The native Americans are not native to America at all can you just remember 'native' Americans derived from mongols in Eurasia they crossed the baring strait from Asia learn your history boy The so-called 'native' Americans have their chance to make America theirs but they lost the war America.The native Americans are not native to America at all can you just remember 'native' Americans derived frommongols inEurasia they crossed the baring strait from Asia learn your history boy The so-called 'native' Americans have their chance to make America theirs but they lost the war America is not stolen it is conquered America is founded and built by Europeans and for Europeans America is a European country and it should stay that way.Thisstrategy is longer than most know: TheJooswere accused of conspiring with the Mooslimsacross the Mediterranean.

In many conquered towns the garrison was left in the hands of theJoos before the Mooslimsproceeded further north. Thus came the,"Golden \textbf{Age}" for SpanishJoos.

If you are going to cry about being conquered them go do something about it and stop crying. Also, if you think native Americans were living in peace with no issues here before Europeans came then once again go research. If Spaniards took land from one tribe, and that tribe had took that land from another tribe and another other tribe had taken that land from ANOTHER tribe then who has true ownership of that land? How can it be determined who should get that land? Who were the true bad people of this situation? Example: There were Central American tribes that did HORRIFIC things to other tribes and "stole" their land and raped their women and enslaved the men. But what the \textbf{common} uneducated belief is that they were all living here dancing with the animals and helping each other and living in total peace until those darn Europeans came and "stole" the land. PLEASE people, go get educated. Research, question, and analyze. You will find that every single culture or \textbf{race} has had times when they they were the victims and times when they were the antagonists.   PLEASE get educated.

(Stillman, p. 53) The (\textbf{Black}) Muslims were greeted by Jews eager to aid them in administering the country. In many conquered towns the garrison was left in the hands of the Jews before the Muslims proceeded further north. Thus came the, "Golden \textbf{Age}" for Spanish Jews. The following quote is self-explanatory. It was written in 1912 by the \textbf{Communist} Jew, Israel Cohen, taken from his book; ' A Racial Program For The Twentieth Century', and entered into the Congressional Record on June 17, 1957, volume 103, page 8559: 'We must realize that our party's most powerful weapon is racial tensions. By propounding into the consciousness of the dark races that for centuries they have been oppressed by whites, we can mold them to the program of the \textbf{COMMUNIST} PARTY. In America we will aim for subtle victory. While inflaming the \textbf{Negro} minority against the Whites, we will endeavor to instill in the whites a guilt complex for their exploitation of the Negroes. We will aid the Negroes to rise in prominence in every walk of life, in the professions and in the world of sports and entertainment. With this prestige, the \textbf{Negro} will be able to intermarry with the whites and begin a process which will deliver America to our cause.' ~ Israel Cohen This is what Trotsky, a Jew, was preparing the Russians for with the implementation of Communism, which Karl Marx (author of the \textbf{Communist} Manifesto 1848), another Jew, based on the Babylonian Talmud for Gentiles: "We should turn Her (Russia) into a desert populated with white N*ggers. We will impose upon them such a tyranny that was never dreamt by the most hideous despots of the East. The peculiar trait of that tyranny is that it will be enacted from the left rather than the right and it will be \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} rather than white in color.

Anyways according to scientists, archaeologists, anthropologist etc. the Native Americans migrated across the bearing straight to America from Siberia, and there is DNA that links them people and other similarities. If you have a hard time accepting that because you are trying to get a upper hand in the political game or find any reason to one up white because you are a \textbf{racist} then, keep the rest of your opinion to yourself, if you genuinely are just open for discussing and inquiring about things, without bias or motive, then cool. Also you need to accept the fact that the "native' people are a conquered people, yes is is harsh, those were different times and everyone was doing it so get over it. Europeans have had to deal with almost being conquered by Arab Muslim and by Ghengis Kahn, this isn't a new game and it isn't new to the "native" Americans who were basically doing the same things to each other before Europeans even showed up. Just like a football game the better team wins while the other team loses, it is just a unfortunate part of history for all peoples. Think of it this way, if this were different times and these migrants were trying to invade Europe and American like they are today, then Europeans would be fighting tooth and nail killing every \textbf{migrant} that steps foot on their lands, so be glad it is the times we live in today. Because personally I think the biggest mistake the American has made was that after the slave trade ended they should have sent all the Africans back to Africa and if they were going to genocide the Native Americans then they should have either exucted ever last one of them OR they should have made a better decision in treating BOTH the remains Native Americans and \textbf{African} with more respect and dignity at tht time, because what the government has been doing to BOTH of them is pretty bad, and that means both Democrats and republicans. At this point in time every \textbf{race} of people living on American land has a country of origin that they migrated from, so perhaps maybe we ALL need to go back to where we came from, but really I would say any coming here after 2965 needs to check their privilege because they are getting it pretty good and easy coming and living in a another peoples country.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African, Migrant, Race, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}4/486 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.823 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@JP Ya, your right there is \textbf{nothing} wrong with challenging those things you have been told, however I don't think they would lie about these things plus I think before all this political correctness nonsense started, they had pretty good evidence of the origins of the native Americans, they could trace their origins back to Siberia, which you can still see the Siberian natives have many similarities to the N. American natives. To say they can't figure out things that happen thousand of years ago or millions of years, isn't necessarily true because scientist are all stupid and DO have ways to figure things out, however much of science is based on theory and not facts, so they can in some cases get a very close idea of what, when, where, when, why, and how things went down in the past. Also many culture do have oral and written history, traditions, legends, myth etc. If you start to just say everything is all a lie and BS and they can't figure anything out then you are just throwing out the baby with the bath water and your still be wrong. Anyways the native Americans lived no differently then many native Europeans did until things like Catholic church, Roman's, Greeks etc. came and essentially did what the the British did to the Natives and "civilized" them and turned them into serfs, peasant,s factory workers etc.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!27}1/234 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.427 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@JP Ya, I did just say that you could walk from Colorado to Siberia if you wanted to and had \textbf{nothing} better to do, why you do think you couldn't? have you ever heard of Terry fox or Rick Hanson?  how about you google all the people that have walked across America the "natives" could have easily walked from Siberia to Alaska and later make their way to the Yukon, NWT, and the rest of N. America no problem. You seem way to narrow minded and too much like your just trying to push some kind of white guilt BS game, which I have no more time for. You are clearly ignorant if that is your game. To start condemning the wrong doing of the past, then I think you need to start putting EVERYONE ON TRIAL, because everyone is guilty of the same thing. So what? many 'native" Americans got killed off and lost their lands to wars, they had guns and horses, and \textbf{African} slaves to use to. it was fair grounds, and their were also many native tribes that were allies with the Europeans because they helped them defeat other enemy tribes. Seems like you are just selective in what you want to believe, and that you say you don't believe anything that happened in history then contradict yourself by only bring up how horrible Europeans were, so what is it you don't want to believe that natives migrated from Siberia because it is BS but you will believe other BS you hear about Americas history. Also to mention that you are white either tells me that you really aren't white or you are just some young cats, that is brainwashed to hate his own people, because of past events, which EVERYONE IS GUILTY OF. Also if you are trying hard to justify immigration of any kind and that is is some kind of right, because you know then natives..then you are again ignorant, to try and use native Americans peoples as political canon fodder. Anyways you are free to believe what you want that is part of what makes the west so great, however keep in mind that you believe is BS and many of those natives that did get killed off are doing very well today , except for the one that can't let go of the drugs and \textbf{alcohol}. So you make a choice either you believe history or you don't because it seems like you're just picking and choosing, what they have told you to fit your own agenda, like you believe the history of the natives american vs the Europeans, without question yet you can believe that they natives migrated from Siberia to N. America, even though there is plenty of evidence to prove it. Maybe the recent history your are being taught is ALL lies, because the globalists are trying to push a agenda so they messed with the history books on purpose so you would believe that ALL the natives were there peaceful loving perfect spiritual peoples until the evil white man came along a killed them all. Look for whatever excuse or guilt trip you want to justify immigrants and open borders if that is you game, but if you care about the natives then adding more foreigners \textbf{immigrant} to america is only compounding the precieved problem your trying to argue about, why add more people to the problem, considering the USA is already the third largest populated country.

In fact, they constantly traded with the Aleutes, Haida, Makah, and Tlingit along the coast of present day Alaska. The world was much different back then, and so was the landscape. The Thule (who migrated into Alaska from Siberia) migrated East into Canada, displacing and killing off the Dorset people, and eventually into Greenland where they surprisingly displaced a Nordic settlement.

George Washington had native American friends, that helped him fight against King George. America did not expand out West until after The Civil War, so America did not start with men marching all over and decimating tribes .Now what King George's Army did, is another story.

However, in this day and \textbf{age}, I believe it is time to get over our pasts, and truly respect each other.During the Western Expansion with the railroads, encounters with some tribes were very dangerous and captured both the settlers, and other tribes. People were going out West and were attacked, killed and taken as prisoners. This is the reason for the awful battles that ensued.  My Grandmother was Cherokee.My Grandfather was half Cherokee Half French. Nowadays, every group of people, is unfortunately stereotyped with Identity Politics. None of us are victims.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Carlos A Lara Go back to school carlos.The native Americans are not native to America at all can you just remember 'native' Americans derived from mongols in Eurasia they crossed the baring strait from Asia learn your history boy The so-called 'native' Americans have their chance to make America theirs but they lost the war America is not stolen it is conquered America is founded and built by Europeans and for Europeans America is a European country and it should stay that way.Comanches came in and took the land from the Apaches by war, Aztecs, Incas and Mayans all grew their empires by conquering lands from other tribes. The Tainos and Canib tribes fought over land. When Spain Defeated the Aztec empire, the did so with an army of 1,000 Spanish soldiers and 75,000 soldiers from the Tlaxcallans, Choulatecs and Totonac tribes.. The practice of claiming the land of conquered enemies extended well past the colonization of America. It wasn't until the conclusion of World War II in 1945 that western culture shunned the practice (and even then, the Soviet Union claimed Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Austria, and many other territories as part of their victory spoils). To claim 'white Europeans' 'stole' America from the native tribes is to force the cultural norms of the past 50 years (that white Europeans created) on events that happened hundreds of years earlier. That is just ignorant. steal-americaAnother problem I have with the 'White people stole America from the Natives' mentality is that it is insulting to Native Americans. It portrays them as ignorant fools easily duped by the evil white man. When, in fact, the brave Native American tribes fought hard, vicious battles to preserve their lands. The United States Census Bureau in 1894 counted over 40 wars involving 'white' Americans and Native Americans between the years 1789 and 1846, which killed 19,000 whites and about 30,000 Indians. During these wars Native Americans committed atrocities against the white settlers. Slaughtering whole towns, raping, scalping, and murdering children were regular acts. During the Pontiacs War in 1764, 4 Delaware \textbf{Indian} Warriors entered a settlers log schoolhouse. There, they killed and scalped the teacher, and nine children. Two children were scalped, but survived their injuries, and 4 other children were taken prisoners. This is the first school massacre on record in America (and it happened before America was even a \textbf{nation}). As you can see, to claim that Native Americans were peace loving nomads that were fooled by the white people is just plain ignorant. If there is one thing we can learn from the Native Americans loss of land to white settlers, it is that we need to have tighter control over our immigration policies. The Native Americans believed that the first European settlers were just refugees trying to escape persecution in their homeland. They thought the American continent was large enough and the resources plentiful enough that they could share it with a few of these foreigners. But soon, these few turned into many, and the many demanded more. Soon the demands turned into violent conflicts, and the Native Americans were trapped in warfare with the new 'immigrants'. The colonists eventually conquered the Native Americans and claimed the land as spoils of war. History repeats itself, and if we are not wary these new waves of undocumented immigrants, and refugees will soon be waging war on us. The native Americans are not native to America at all can you just remember 'native' Americans derived from mongols in Eurasia they crossed the baring strait from Asia learn your historySpain 694, Joos were accused of conspiring with the Muslims across the Mediterranean. "The Arab Moors were perceived as, and indeed were, a liberating force." (Stillman, p. 53) The (\textbf{Black}) Muslims were greeted by Joos eager to aid them in administering the country. In many conquered towns the garrison was left in the hands of the Joos before the Muslims proceeded further north. Thus came the, "Golden \textbf{Age}" for Spanish Joos. The following quote is self-explanatory. It was written in 1912 by the \textbf{Communist} Joo, Israel Cohen, taken from his book; ' A Racial Program For The Twentieth Century', and entered into the Congressional Record on June 17, 1957, volume 103, page 8559: 'We must realize that our party's most powerful weapon is racial tensions. By propounding into the consciousness of the dark races that for centuries they have been oppressed by whites, we can mold them to the program of the \textbf{COMMUNIST} PARTY. In America we will aim for subtle victory. While inflaming the \textbf{Negro} minority against the Whites, we will endeavor to instill in the whites a guilt complex for their exploitation of the Negroes. We will aid the Negroes to rise in prominence in every walk of life, in the professions and in the world of sports and entertainment. With this prestige, the \textbf{Negro} will be able to intermarry with the whites and begin a process which will deliver America to our cause.' ~ Israel Cohen This is what Trotsky, aJoo, was preparing the Russians for with the implementation of Communism, which Karl Marx (author of the \textbf{Communist} Manifesto 1848), anotheJooo, based on the Babylonian Talmud for Gentiles: "We should turn Her (Russia) into a desert populated with white N*ggers. We will impose upon them such a tyranny that was never dreamt by the most hideous despots of the East. The peculiar trait of that tyranny is that it will be enacted from the left rather than the right and it will be \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} rather than white in color.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Post that was sent to Thisstrategy is longer than most know: TheJooswere accused of conspiring with the Mooslimsacross the Mediterranean. "The ArabMoors were perceived as, and indeed were,a liberating force."(Stillman, p. 53) Theblack Mooslimswere greeted byJoos eager to aid them in administering the country. In many conquered towns the garrison was left in the hands of theJoos before the Mooslimsproceeded further north. Thus came the,"Golden \textbf{Age}" for SpanishJoos. The following quote is self-explanatory. It was written in 1912 by the CommunistJoo,Israel Cohen, taken from his book; 'A RacialProgram For The Twentieth Century', and entered into the Congressional Record on June 17, 1957, volume 103, page 8559: 'We must realize that our party's most powerful weapon isracial tensions. By propounding into the consciousness of the darkracesthat for centuries they have been oppressedbywhites, we can mold them to the program of the COMMUNISTPARTY. In America we will aim for subtle victory. While inflaming the Negrominority against theWhites, we will endeavor to instill in thewhites a guilt complex for their exploitation of theNegroes.This is what Trotsky, a Joo, was preparing theRussians for with the implementation of Communismwhich KarlMarx (author of the CommunistManifesto1848), another Joo, based on the BabylonianTalmud forGentiles: "We should turn Her(Russia) into a desert populated withwhiteNgers. We will impose upon them such a tyranny that was never dreamt by the most hideous despots of the East. The peculiar trait of that tyranny is that it will be enacted from the left rather than the right and it will be \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} rather thanwhite in color. Its color will be \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} literally because we would spill such torrents of blood that they will pale all human lossIt's not right for legal, law-abiding citizens and the men and women who have fought for this country to be treated as second-class citizens. And to the Liberals who insist on calling us a minority, give it up. Instead, we let them come here with their kids, grandparents, and extended family.  Not only that, they also manage to turn a 4-bedroom, 3-bath home into an apartment complex housing 3-4 families at a time. I've witnessed it.But what really gets under my skin is the audacity illegalimmigrants have.  It's not an uncommon sight to go to the doctor's office or store and see a \textbf{woman} with her children and a book filled with welfare and medical cards for each child and herself.  I'm talking dental and medical insurance, EBT cards, etc. She barely speaks a word of English, yet is usually the first to be taken care of while the rest of us tax-paying citizens watch helplessly from the sidelines as money we've earned goes to someone who hasn't worked in the U.S. a day in their life.Now in college, I've come to understand the concepts of financial aid, welfare, and assistance programs that supply resources to someone in 'need.' I actually use that term very lightly considering how much 'need' is really not needed. It's ironic how much money there is for scholarships for immigrants andHispanics, yet an Americanpatriot has to struggle through college. Take for example my own father who, back in the day, was told by his high school counselor to give up the idea of receiving a scholarship unless he was an athletic superstar, simply because he was Caucasianwith no other \textbf{ethnic} background whatsoever.  Still, California GovernorBrown can't wait for his DREAMAct to be enacted.  Discriminationmuch?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Indians are immigrants to the country that would become the USA just like all the people in this country only they got here first!!!!  They walked over from ASIA ( they did not 'transport' to America from the Starship Enterprise) except they were the \textbf{dumb} ones because the smart Asians (Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans) stayed in Asia and developed great civilizations while these \textbf{dumb} Asian cousins crossed over the Bering Straits and did \textbf{nothing}.  The USA was not stolen from these Stone \textbf{Age} people; it was conquered!!!  The Indians did not OWN this land  anymore than ground squirrels own this land; they never developed it; they just walked on top of it stepping on buffalo shit.  When the first Europeans encountered the Indians, they were still roaming around hunting and gathering crap off the ground just like Stone \textbf{Age} people.  The North American Indians never developed a true civilization with a written language,  a numbering system, and they were still running around naked ( come to think of it...not a bad idea!!).  The Europeans did not steal anything from the Indians, the Europeans kicked the Indians butts  as they assumed control of North America; a lot different than stealing (stealing=lowlife; conquering=warrior)!!!!  Why is it that the Chinese who came over in the 1930's, speaking no English, assimilated quite well into US culture; why not the Indians??  My father came over (legally) to America in the 1930's with \textbf{NOTHING}, speaking no English and with no experience with Western culture; when he passed at 100 years, he was a multi-millionaire.  The Indians have been here thousands of years and all they can point to is drunk-drugged out Indians.  BTW, Dad put all his kids through college, 2 became doctors; he sold moon shine 'fire water' to Indians on the Navajo Reservation when he first arrived in this country.  He use to tell me how 'crazy' the Indians got with a few sips of alcohol; he said if the Indians are Asians, they sure don't act like Asians. Finally, when I worked for \textbf{Indian} Health Service, I heard all the excuses why Indians can't make it in a technologically advance society (I just rolled my eyes); I even did time at the Pine Ridge \textbf{Indian} Reservation Hospital!!!  Please stay pissed off at the Great White oppressors, play VICTIM, please cling to your Stone \textbf{Age} traditions, please stay backward because without drunk lazy Indians, the rest of American Society wouldn't appreciate what it means to live the good life in America ( if all Americans were rich and successful, then all of us would be middle class!). While Indians have their hands out for another government freebie/welfare, the rest of us will be opportunistic and take full advantage of all the opportunities this country offers to people who want to get off their butts and work very HARD.  BTW, I am THE  1 of this \textbf{nation} with net assets in the 8 figures; I vote 100 REPUBLICAN.  A secret;  Most REAL ASIANS think Indians are lazy-good for \textbf{nothing}. 😂😂😂😂!!!

Eventually they would sign peace treaties with the US... and the US would break those treaties again. It was the same story across the country. That's why it's a stolen country.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The main reason why these reservations are so poor is that they are distant from any major commercial city; resource hub. The reason why some reservations like the Pechanga and Mohegan are so rich is that they capitalize on gambling, which is legal in reservations and mostly illegal elsewhere in the US, and are near large cities, these are specifically in California. The ethical issue is simple and hard. The Natives had a good run with settling the Americas, but it didn't last. \textbf{Nothing} lasts. They were beaten by stronger people, mostly by a disease they didn't even know were deadly. Of course, the conflict of the American-Indian Wars was brutal, but it was a two-way street. Natives would raid American settlements and even cities; i.e. The Great Raid of 1840. Make no mistake, like all tribal civilizations, savagery is rampant. Natives always fought and killed other tribes for territory and resources, from the Inuit of the Arctic to the Yaghan of the south. War is not the 'white man's' disease, its the human disease. I'm not justifying the murder of a people, I'm just clarifying that times back then were tough, and only the strong survive. Today Natives are given the land of their own which is protected by the U.S. government. They even passed the Native America Aid (NAA), a program dedicated to support the lifestyle of the tribes. Of course, their poverty is their own choosing. Natives are allowed to find jobs in the U.S. and even have educational benefits, sometimes free college. Although their lands are poverty-stricken, the government does their best to provide, even if they aren't obligated too. I am a first generation American, born from an Italian father and a Philippine mother. I am not responsible for the deaths of those natives in the past and neither are any Americans living today. Tensions were high and people fought. We can only learn from the mistakes of the past and prevent them in the future. So again, most reservations are poor because they are far from large, industrial, commercial cities and the lifestyles the natives choose to live are also distant from the hustle and bustle of the urban areas. America is not a stolen country, it was founded on July 4, 1776, fought off anyone that didn't like it, survived, and became the largest superpower in modern human history.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Playing blame games and not dealing with  the real issues in a serious nor constructive way will NEVER solve ones problems.  Doing those things simply maintains problems and makes sure solutions won't come. Coming from a poor , even aweful background is  not the real problem.

There is no difference between acting like a loser than being a loser. You may think problems are insurmountable. Only if you do \textbf{nothing} about them, sure. Only if you engage in behavior that makes things worse. You end up defeating yourself while those you call your enemy arent even thinking about you and arent even enemies.

Let that stupid sheotte go. The only ones holding you prisoner are yourselves.  You can fix yourself, first. Self defeating behavior will follow you, wherever you go. But, so will successful attitudes. After you allowed yourself an attitude adjustment, of valuing good character, valuing family, accepting responsibility and deciding to self support, then, and only then, you could go to where opportunities exist.

They enjoyed several big civilizations and literally all of their culture was drenched in bloodshed including their religion . Most likely they felt no kinship with different tribes or countries and had conflicts endlessly as shown when Europeans came, natives had slaves of their own. Same thing goes for  Africa, slavery wasn't only present but also a lucrative business because of demand and supply chain . At some point they didn't only sell the people they conquered , but rather started wars in order to get slaves and sell them , similarly they didn't feel this racial connection that is portrayed in the last 50 years , that slavery business damaged profoundly their population growth. There is no \textbf{old} cities in Africa , at least not intact important cities from antiquity , even though there were a massive number of civilizations that collapsed in the hands of younger  and hungrier people of the region.

None of us is responsible for the  actions of our ancestors. Having said that, by taking our privilege for granted, we, in our ignorance and arrogance continue the mistreatment  of the indigenous ones whose colonisation we ignore.  Genocide is more than simply murder based on \textbf{race}. Genocide is cultural as well. Rather than taking our privilege as colonisers for granted, and thus maintaining the status quo, we need to be pro active for equality. We need to be truly respectful of difference, without the theft of  culture. If we are not being active for a just solution, then we  are a part of the ongoing problem.  Here in Australia, the First Nations' peoples have a phrase for those of us whose actions  are pro Land Rights, pro Cultural Rights and of course,respectful. They call it "Coming the Right Way."  This is the desired behaviour. If we sit on our backsides, take our privilege for granted and do \textbf{nothing}, then we sure have the wrong perspective and thus we continue the genocide.

This is the quintessential history of the Indians, they slaughtered one another for centuries, and now want sympathy from the final conquerors of the Americas.

The Tainos and Canib tribes fought over land. When Spain Defeated the Aztec empire, the did so with an army of 1,000 Spanish soldiers and 75,000 soldiers from the Tlaxcallans, Choulatecs and Totonac tribes.. The practice of claiming the land of conquered enemies extended well past the colonization of America. It wasn't until the conclusion of World War II in 1945 that western culture shunned the practice (and even then, the Soviet Union claimed Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Austria, and many other territories as part of their victory spoils). To claim 'white Europeans' 'stole' America from the native tribes is to force the cultural norms of the past 50 years (that white Europeans created) on events that happened hundreds of years earlier. That is just ignorant. steal-americaAnother problem I have with the 'White people stole America from the Natives' mentality is that it is insulting to Native Americans. It portrays them as ignorant fools easily duped by the evil white man. When, in fact, the brave Native American tribes fought hard, vicious battles to preserve their lands. The United States Census Bureau in 1894 counted over 40 wars involving 'white' Americans and Native Americans between the years 1789 and 1846, which killed 19,000 whites and about 30,000 Indians. During these wars Native Americans committed atrocities against the white settlers. Slaughtering whole towns, raping, scalping, and murdering children were regular acts. During the Pontiacs War in 1764, 4 Delaware \textbf{Indian} Warriors entered a settlers log schoolhouse. There, they killed and scalped the teacher, and nine children. Two children were scalped, but survived their injuries, and 4 other children were taken prisoners. This is the first school massacre on record in America (and it happened before America was even a \textbf{nation}). As you can see, to claim that Native Americans were peace loving nomads that were fooled by the white people is just plain ignorant. If there is one thing we can learn from the Native Americans loss of land to white settlers, it is that we need to have tighter control over our immigration policies. The Native Americans believed that the first European settlers were just refugees trying to escape persecution in their homeland. They thought the American continent was large enough and the resources plentiful enough that they could share it with a few of these foreigners. But soon, these few turned into many, and the many demanded more. Soon the demands turned into violent conflicts, and the Native Americans were trapped in warfare with the new 'immigrants'. The colonists eventually conquered the Native Americans and claimed the land as spoils of war. History repeats itself, and if we are not wary these new waves of undocumented immigrants, and refugees will soon be waging war on us. The native Americans are not native to America at all can you just remember 'native' Americans derived from mongols in Eurasia they crossed the baring strait from Asia learn your historySpain 694, Jews were accused of conspiring with the Muslims across the Mediterranean. "The Arab Moors were perceived as, and indeed were, a liberating force." (Stillman, p. 53) The (\textbf{Black}) Muslims were greeted by Jews eager to aid them in administering the country. In many conquered towns the garrison was left in the hands of the Jews before the Muslims proceeded further north. Thus came the, "Golden \textbf{Age}" for Spanish Jews. The following quote is self-explanatory. It was written in 1912 by the \textbf{Communist} Jew, Israel Cohen, taken from his book; ' A Racial Program For The Twentieth Century', and entered into the Congressional Record on June 17, 1957, volume 103, page 8559: 'We must realize that our party's most powerful weapon is racial tensions. By propounding into the consciousness of the dark races that for centuries they have been oppressed by whites, we can mold them to the program of the \textbf{COMMUNIST} PARTY. In America we will aim for subtle victory. While inflaming the \textbf{Negro} minority against the Whites, we will endeavor to instill in the whites a guilt complex for their exploitation of the Negroes. We will aid the Negroes to rise in prominence in every walk of life, in the professions and in the world of sports and entertainment. With this prestige, the \textbf{Negro} will be able to intermarry with the whites and begin a process which will deliver America to our cause.' ~ Israel Cohen This is what Trotsky, a Jew, was preparing the Russians for with the implementation of Communism, which Karl Marx (author of the \textbf{Communist} Manifesto 1848), another Jew, based on the Babylonian Talmud for Gentiles: "We should turn Her (Russia) into a desert populated with white N*ggers. We will impose upon them such a tyranny that was never dreamt by the most hideous despots of the East. The peculiar trait of that tyranny is that it will be enacted from the left rather than the right and it will be \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} rather than white in color.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Nearly every aspect of economic development is controlled by federal agencies which means that all development projects must be reviewed and authorized by the government.

It's not uncommon for years to pass before necessary approvals are acquired to begin energy development on reservations - a process that only takes a few months on private land. At any time an agency may demand information or shut down the development.Simply completing a title search can cause delays.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Malorie Thank you for your thoughts and input. I have visited several Midwestern states. I went through Wyoming, Montana, South Dakota, and Nebraska to visit my fellow Native Americans. I have never felt so much \textbf{racism} in my life. I live in a mostly latin community that doesn't really judge me. I occasionally get the stereotypical commentary, but in the Midwest... it was no holds barred. My experiences was the constant glaring, made to wait for table service (20+ mins), no vacancy (hotel parking lot was almost completely empty), and the cherry on top... 'go back to the reservation'. I did meet a few kind people, however... the negative outweighed the positive. I'll stay in my corner of the US (that my Tribe fought and died for). 👍🏽\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Racism & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/128 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.781 \\  \hline

"The ArabMoors were perceived as, and indeed were,a liberating force."(Stillman, p. 53) Theblack Mooslimswere greeted byJoos eager to aid them in administering the country. In many conquered towns the garrison was left in the hands of theJoos before the Mooslimsproceeded further north. Thus came the,"Golden \textbf{Age}" for SpanishJoos. The following quote is self-explanatory. It was written in 1912 by the CommunistJoo,Israel Cohen, taken from his book; 'A RacialProgram For The Twentieth Century', and entered into the Congressional Record on June 17, 1957, volume 103, page 8559: 'We must realize that our party's most powerful weapon isracial tensions. By propounding into the consciousness of the darkracesthat for centuries they have been oppressedbywhites, we can mold them to the program of the COMMUNISTPARTY. In America we will aim for subtle victory. While inflaming the Negrominority against theWhites, we will endeavor to instill in thewhites a guilt complex for their exploitation of theNegroes.This is what Trotsky, a Joo, was preparing theRussians for with the implementation of Communismwhich KarlMarx (author of the CommunistManifesto1848), another Joo, based on the BabylonianTalmud forGentiles: "We should turn Her(Russia) into a desert populated withwhiteNgers.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Lua B These so called Native Americans are not native to the Americas at all. They came from Siberia and regions in Eurasia many thousands of years ago. America is also not a \textbf{nation} of immigrants because to be an \textbf{immigrant} there has to be foreigners entering to an existing country. The white settlers like pilgrims, pioneers and colonists are not immigrants because America didn't exist and it was not a country during that time. The founding fathers of America were also not immigrants because they are the ones that formed this country. These so called natives were not peaceful people at all. They conquered other lands, exploited resources, raped, had slaves, committed mass genocide and pillaged other places way before white people showed up. Even when white people first arrive to the new world, a vast majority of the land was unclaimed. So saying that these so called Native Americans were peaceful people and saying that this is their country are complete BS myths coming from the Left. So saying that White Americans should go back to Europe is also a complete BS myth coming from Liberals. The true native Americans are white people. Without white people there would be no America.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Indoor grass No racismwas created by \textbf{communist}.The native Americans are not native to America at all can you just remember 'native' Americans derived from mongols in Eurasia they crossed the baring strait from Asia learn your history boy The so-called 'native' Americans have their chance to make America theirs but they lost the war America is not stolen it is conquered America is founded and built by Europeans and for Europeans America is a European country and it should stay that way.Comanches came in and took the land from the Apaches by war, Aztecs, Incas and Mayans all grew their empires by conquering lands from other tribes. The Tainos and Canib tribes fought over land. When Spain Defeated the Aztec empire, the did so with an army of 1,000 Spanish soldiers and 75,000 soldiers from the Tlaxcallans, Choulatecs and Totonac tribes.. The practice of claiming the land of conquered enemies extended well past the colonization of America. It wasn't until the conclusion of World War II in 1945 that western culture shunned the practice (and even then, the Soviet Union claimed Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Austria, and many other territories as part of their victory spoils). To claim 'white Europeans' 'stole' America from the native tribes is to force the cultural norms of the past 50 years (that white Europeans created) on events that happened hundreds of years earlier. That is just ignorant. steal-americaAnother problem I have with the 'White people stole America from the Natives' mentality is that it is insulting to Native Americans. It portrays them as ignorant fools easily duped by the evil white man. When, in fact, the brave Native American tribes fought hard, vicious battles to preserve their lands. The United States Census Bureau in 1894 counted over 40 wars involving 'white' Americans and Native Americans between the years 1789 and 1846, which killed 19,000 whites and about 30,000 Indians. During these wars Native Americans committed atrocities against the white settlers. Slaughtering whole towns, raping, scalping, and murdering children were regular acts. During the Pontiacs War in 1764, 4 Delaware \textbf{Indian} Warriors entered a settlers log schoolhouse. There, they killed and scalped the teacher, and nine children. Two children were scalped, but survived their injuries, and 4 other children were taken prisoners. This is the first school massacre on record in America (and it happened before America was even a \textbf{nation}). As you can see, to claim that Native Americans were peace loving nomads that were fooled by the white people is just plain ignorant. If there is one thing we can learn from the Native Americans loss of land to white settlers, it is that we need to have tighter control over our immigration policies. The Native Americans believed that the first European settlers were just refugees trying to escape persecution in their homeland. They thought the American continent was large enough and the resources plentiful enough that they could share it with a few of these foreigners. But soon, these few turned into many, and the many demanded more. Soon the demands turned into violent conflicts, and the Native Americans were trapped in warfare with the new 'immigrants'. The colonists eventually conquered the Native Americans and claimed the land as spoils of war. History repeats itself, and if we are not wary these new waves of undocumented immigrants, and refugees will soon be waging war on us. The native Americans are not native to America at all can you just remember 'native' Americans derived from mongols in Eurasia they crossed the baring strait from Asia learn your historySpain 694, Joos were accused of conspiring with the Muslims across the Mediterranean. "The Arab Moors were perceived as, and indeed were, a liberating force." (Stillman, p. 53) The (\textbf{Black}) Muslims were greeted by Joos eager to aid them in administering the country. In many conquered towns the garrison was left in the hands of the Joos before the Muslims proceeded further north. Thus came the, "Golden \textbf{Age}" for Spanish Joos. The following quote is self-explanatory. It was written in 1912 by the \textbf{Communist} Joo, Israel Cohen, taken from his book; ' A Racial Program For The Twentieth Century', and entered into the Congressional Record on June 17, 1957, volume 103, page 8559: 'We must realize that our party's most powerful weapon is racial tensions. By propounding into the consciousness of the dark races that for centuries they have been oppressed by whites, we can mold them to the program of the \textbf{COMMUNIST} PARTY. In America we will aim for subtle victory. While inflaming the \textbf{Negro} minority against the Whites, we will endeavor to instill in the whites a guilt complex for their exploitation of the Negroes. We will aid the Negroes to rise in prominence in every walk of life, in the professions and in the world of sports and entertainment. With this prestige, the \textbf{Negro} will be able to intermarry with the whites and begin a process which will deliver America to our cause.' ~ Israel Cohen This is what Trotsky, aJoo, was preparing the Russians for with the implementation of Communism, which Karl Marx (author of the \textbf{Communist} Manifesto 1848), anotheJooo, based on the Babylonian Talmud for Gentiles: "We should turn Her (Russia) into a desert populated with white N*ggers. We will impose upon them such a tyranny that was never dreamt by the most hideous despots of the East. The peculiar trait of that tyranny is that it will be enacted from the left rather than the right and it will be \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} rather than white in color.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I wonder if the druids and celts of Europe were to replace any other empire throughout European history would things be different considering the Celts had more respect for the land especially the druids they worshipped nature and spirits like a native population of what we call America. I was thinking heavily about this favour day that how are psyche is developed to wear with live. I'm not justifying for colonization in any way whatsoever. I think we all portable turn back Time and stop it from happening regardless of where you are from. So Europeans, me basically, evolved amongst many other countries but had a more border like idolatry and image to. Yes native Americans did have the wars with other tribes what I am saying is did v geography in Europe cause us Europeans to become more greedy and violence over a lack of what we understood we owned. Europe could have been invaded from the middle East from the North from Asia from Eurasia anyway so I was more of a height and chance for invasion and instability. Did this make us a bloodthirsty \textbf{race} a greedy one that is. When I think about north America they could only get invaded by central or South America but that would have been highly improbable when you see the size of the Inca empire they went off marched all the way into North to take what was by right nobody's to take. There was enough land for everybody to feel more secure so maybe this is why and natives weren't as bloodthirsty and greedy as the European villains. Native Americans still skinned scalps and protect a secret area of land by means of blood over believing that river had a spirit. I am sending this for your limited on the kind of pagan like animist religion they had. Nevertheless it would be interesting to see if he would have got on with the Celts and druids. And yes the religion is a massive factor in this. You didn't forward into imperialism in my eyes. Want to be adopted Christianity that was it. \textbf{Nothing} but violence not forgetting the pagan Roman empire of course before they went Christian.

Genghis khan and the mongols conquered and replaced existing societies. The ottomans the Ming dynasty the list goes on and on so why so much emphasis with the natives? Why do they get so much sympathy. People and nations and have been slaughtered their culture and languages replaced with others since the dawn of time. The spanish were conquered by the moors and changed over time the celts by the romans as well as the Gauls. The romans by the Gauls before that. And one day even our country the "evil" USA will have its time and another replacing it as well.

You cannot outwardly conquer a white \textbf{nation}, the intelligence factor isn't there.  You see, it's only okay to kill white people, look at the people on here relishing in it.  Their ancestors were conquered by great whites, and the only thing they can do is use the internet invented by whites, electricity invented by whites, computers invented by whites, cars invented by whites to tell whites how bad they are.  Put your money where your mouth is, stop using the evil white mans inventions and way of life.  Stop speaking English, stop driving cars, stop using electricity, stop using the internet, stop eating the food from the grocery stores, stop washing your clothes with a washer and dryer, stop living off the teet of what great white men built. The simple fact is, minus Asians and whites, there aren't too many nations that can build or offer what white nations do.  As you say, when the shitty Mexicans take over with the blacks, and the Muslims, it will turn into a 3rd world shit-hole.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@J Y I own up to our history. Much like I'm sure Mexicans own up to their Aztec empire dominating the Mexico region. It's history. But what I won't do is say we stole their land. Every single piece of land on this planet has been "stolen". Every single border that was put up, every single territory someone owns, was won by bloodshed and taken lives. This is literally the history of human beings on planet Earth. This isn't an American thing, this isn't a white thing or an Anglo/European thing. Period. I know the left wants us to believe this but please, let me point you to Nanking, Ghengis Khan, Mao, The Persian Empire, the Assryian Empire, Russian Empires, The Babylonian Empire, the Roman Empire, the Islam Caliphate, the slave trade that Africa and Arab nations both participated in and I mean the list goes on and on and on. Did you even know that the Arab slave trade went on until the late 50's? Not 1850 but 1950! That means both \textbf{African} nations AND Arab nations were (still are in my opinion) participating in the slavement of their OWN people until the 50's. Yes, the history of the US when solely looking at it can be seen as hurtful. But when compared to the rest of the world, WITH context, the US was far more progressed than any \textbf{nation} at that time. Fuck, just look up the first \textbf{black} representives in the US. Some were even BEFORE we abolished slavery as a whole. Did you know that before 1776, many territories on the East coast had already abolished slavery? They made it a crime for anyone who imported slaves? Then, shortly after was made into national law after the British had ended the Trans Atlantic Slave Trade. Did you know that at the height of our slavery only 6....6!!!! Of people owned slaves here in the US? And that even though it was only 6 felt the need to have our ONLY civil war over it? Did you know they're were \textbf{black} loyalist to the Southern states that fought on their behalf and agaisnt their own \textbf{race}? History is complicated. And my first sign to know someone doesn't know history or doesn't love history is that they pretend every thing is simple. History is complicated and deserves time. If people actually took the time to learn history, you would be confused on which side to choose because often times men were forced to choose a side, even if it were the wrong/losing side. Great example? The French during WW2. After the Nazi's took over, many had to get involved with Nazis for the safety of their lives and family. What's also sad, is that the democrat party has TAKEN this history from blacks and even Natives. They have made \textbf{black}/natives feel like they never had a history here when in reality, they have been just as much apart of the US's history as any. With inventions, politicial power, movements and intelligence. But, want to know what always holds them back? Government and the Democrat party. Want to really help Natives? Get government OUT of their lives. Give them their land back. They cant sell their land or profit from it.  They are regulated on what they can produce crop wise. They have to pay in order to do things on their land and etc etc. That isnt even the worst of it. If you really want to learn something, watch Russell Means testimony in 1989 in front of Congress and see the REAL issue facing Natives. It isn't America as a country but the GOVERNMENT of this country. Our only enemy is our government. It has never been the founding Fathers or this country and what it stand for. It's whatever power is in office and what power they have over the people. Smaller governmenr LESS power.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African, Black, Nation, Race & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}5/649 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.77 \\  \hline

Kill the indigenous natives and whoever is left, marginalize them and create artificial poverty, once that poverty becomes crime and drinking, the media points to the poor and blames them to continue to stigmatize the 'other' community, scumbags, etc. Amazing fact that Indigenous Native Americans had built such great civilizations as Mayan, Inca and Aztec without outside help, and all from the scratch, and all on their own, since they had been cut off from the rest of the world for ten of thousand of years. In other words, they actually are great and proud people. All they need is their beloved motherlands back, the lands that their ancestors forebears had lived through thick and \textbf{thin}, endured through hardships and all. Moreover, the hidden mega genocide of indigenous Native Americans, and their population in Continents of America 500 yrs ago was around 15 millions, while European population in Europe was around 20 millions. Today, Native population at 15 million, while European population ( in continents of America + Europe) at a staggering 'ONE BILLION'! Imagine what would it be like today if Native Americans had possessed some sort of nuclear weapons to defend themselves, and their beloved motherlands from invaders Colonizers? The answer is they would still have their own beloved motherlands, plus their population comparable to that of European population. I've no doubt about that. In my humble opinion, it's about time to decolonize the Colonized lands, and return it to rightful owners Native American people. remember, notorious Slavery as well as Colonialism had long been over, why on earth is this another notorious Colonization still lingering on?

In America, most in the south of america, has already this concept of civilisation (mayas, incas, olmeks…) and some tribes, a decade ago,  discovery an archeological site discovered under California mud \textbf{age} ~5000 years from today shows also these evidences. Saying European has  bring civilisation and land propriety is not true. It was already there. When British and French came, the invasion of America was done slower by treaties and trades, and indigenous let them took over. The first european were not stupid to declare war with an up number population, who knows the land and could get easily killed. They use an \textbf{old} fashion asian strategy (the friendship easy to break and use any excuses to invade, genocide).But who cannot resist to new technology, easy clothing, new goods and having a powerfull friend to conquer your ennemis ? That's humanity History, always. When the invador has take over, they decide. Even in 2019, it is not only in the usa or canada, other part of the world too. and this policies shouldn't exist anymore.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}2/217 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.922 \\  \hline

In other words, they actually are great and proud people. All they need is their beloved father lands back, the lands that their ancestors had lived through thick and \textbf{thin}, endured through hardships and all. Moreover, the fact that 200 years ago, 3 million Germans came, and now they have 65 millions German-Americans; while 150 years ago, 2 millions Irish came, now there is 45 million Irish-Americans here in USA. While 500 years ago before there were estimated 5 to 6 millions in North America alone before Christopher Columbus, today it is 2 million indigenous Native Americans survived. In my humble opinion, it's about time to de-colonize the Colonized lands, and return it to rightful owners indigenous Native American people.

Here's the analysis. How come another Indigenous \textbf{African} slaves that were brought over from remote West Africa, deepest part of Africa, who also had no prior contact with White Europeans,  were not wiped out by diseases? The other story told was 'Cowboys and Indians'. The story goes like that native Indians were slaughtered by Cowboys. But what really happened to indigenous Native Americans, so-called Indians, and the real life story was further from the truth. In reality, they were slaughtered not only by cowboys, but most by settlers, civilian militias, military, and all are backed by general populace, the country and the government, as a whole, since every groups had \textbf{nothing} to lose but more to gain.

Give War Before Civilization: The Myth of the Peaceful Savage (Oxford University Press, 1996) by Lawrence Keeley of the University of Illinois, and Constant Battles: The Myth of the Peaceful, Noble Savage (Saint Martin's Press, 2003) by Steven LeBlanc of Harvard.   Actual EVIDENCE shows the native tribes were in a state of constant warfare for at least a thousand years before yt showed up.Then came the Europeans.  Europeans did \textbf{NOTHING} to the natives that they weren't already doing to each other.  Europeans were just better at it, because they had horses, cannons, and boom sticks.  Europeans simply had better technology.  So they won.  That is all, they won.  They were better at playing the game.  The continent was always contested.  Natives walked here from Eurasia and butchered each other for centuries.  They were the FIRST colonialists, not somehow the original owners who sprang from the rocks and trees and owned the Americas by some divine decree.  The Europeans just sailed instead of walked.The \textbf{Indian} as innocent victim oppressed by yt is a myth \textbf{blind} to the realities of the warlike nature of the native peoples.  This is human history, everywhere - we compete for resources, often through bloodshed.  No one is innocent.  One side wins, one side loses.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small America is not a "stolen country" and white people/USA are not evil.1. let's stop calling them just "Native Americans" and look at them as their tribes, they're all different with different backgrounds. If you generalize all tribes it shows your lack of knowledge on the subject. Stop generalizing all tribes and therefore stop generalizing all white people as one.2. The USA was a country born in America, we became our own country from Britain, and during our Revolution some tribes sided with the US but the most powerful tribes sided with the British. We fought to be our own people and won.3. I too am a native, no not like a "Native American" in terms of tribes, I mean it in it's real definition, I was born here, I was raised here, it's as much their land as it is mine. My ancestry is European, but my family has been here since the 1600s. And even still there is \textbf{nothing} wrong with immigration.4. If we all came from Africa then we are immigrants everywhere. The Normans and Anglo Saxons were not originally from Britain either, but no one is complaining about that.5. It's not like the USA just started slaughtering people. Like with any country there were different relations with each tribe. There were wrongs on both sides, it's very gray, no real good guy. There were some justified wars and some not so much.6. Every tribe wasn't some peaceful nice little loving tribes, there were tribes of trade only but also war tribes who did horrible things. Check out the Jicarilla War, which was a war between the US and the Apache and Ute tribes. It started with mass rape and murder of American settler caravans moving into land the US legally owned. Justifying killing innocent settlers is like saying we should rape and murder all the women and children at the US border from Mexico.7. While there were times the US did massacres, most of the times it happened were not by order.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The fact that history continues to be whitewashed should say alot. 1) Mercator map projection: This map that is globally used, demonstrates the very nature of intellectual hegemony. In the map, North America and Europe are made much larger than they actually are, which surely fit the needs of the German monarchs who commissioned Mercator. And Google definitely carries on in the same tradition. Just so you know, Africa is 3-4x bigger than North America and Europe. 2) History taught in schools everywhere focus on Post-Industrial Revolution Europe mainly, with much references to Rome and the Macedonian  Alexander. World history texts conveniently omit the advanced civilisations of the Indians (Mohenjo-Daro/Harrappa), Chinese, Göbekli Tepe, Sumerians, Babylonians, Norse, etc. Like so in academia, where most of the overly influential elite reside in Europe, with research institutions, think-tanks, publications, and every sort of influence/money/power resides. Funny how education and intellectualism is so closely linked to money and power huh.3) All this is coupled with whitewashed history, are the institutions of business corporations and the media. Both of these are consistently overrepresented by Western Europeans following the Colonial period into the current Ideological/Economic hegemony of the West. Everything traded in the world somehow is pegged to USD and mostly traded to European middlemen before heading to the rest of the world. And of course, the giant corporations have the say in the overpriced final products we consume daily. Look at \textbf{Apple} products that are wildly overpriced from the initial raw materials extracted from \textbf{African} nations like Congo. It's the same for the oil industry and every raw material being used today. It's all a Centralised planned market for the materials and products.Likewise, the media is mostly confined to the syndicated news of Reuters, AP and AFP. The whole push that got the world looking at Muslims as terrorists when modern terrorism was founded by the Zionist Lehigh, Haganah, Irgun, etc. It's amazing results of indoctrination that the media echo chamber produces. Meanwhile, Hollywood and every advertising agency consistently portray Westerners as the pinnacle of society. This is notwithstanding the conflated social status of celebrities who are strategically used to capture the attention of people worldwide so that politicians can do the dirty work in the background. A great system Hollywood and the US governmental agencies have!Sometimes the difference is as subtle as the Expat Vs \textbf{Migrant} worker divide. The obvious class divide is cautiously covered by a bureaucratic obfuscation.

Nor did you explain why the white man took \textbf{black} unto the ground out of their recent publications.Your telling me he was a jew as if trying to prove he was what Caucasian lmao.Moses, Joseph, Paul were all mistaken for Egyptians. Mary and Joseph HID Jesus in Egypt, why didn't they hid in Europe? TMH himself says that under seige the TWELVE tribes ran and continued to give supplications beyond the rivers of Ethiopia again why didn't they all hid in Europe? Ethiopians aka hamites are a dark \textbf{race} of people. TMH compares his people to the Egyptians and the Ethiopians not Europeans lolDaniel describes TMH himself as having hair like the pure wool. Who on the planet have always been mocked for they're wooly hair? Adam was also created from the dust of the ground I asked you when you dig what colour is the earth. You ignored that to. Miriam was stripped of her melanin when TMH CURSED her and she was turned white. What colour was she before?TMH proformed a miracle using Moses hand but what color did he return to. If he was already void of melanin where would the miracle be? The twelve tribes ie the sons of Jacob are a dark skinned people.I know you will ignore all those biblical facts cus thats what you people do. Fact remains those indenity thieves do not fit the curses/punishments laid out in deuteronomy and they know it you just have to ask them.

The United States is the most powerful \textbf{nation} on the planet for now, yet we don't enslave or mass murder or rob people. We give the most charity of anyone and have done more for human rights than any other \textbf{nation} in history. We have apologized with sincerity for past wrongs, and we publish books exposing our darkest deeds. Who else in the world does this? No one except other European nations. The US is powerful and on the whole, we use our powers for Good. Look back in history at what other nations have done when they have absolute power– it's atrocious. Current example: Venezuela, starving its people to death under a socialist dictatorship. People like to complain and blame Europeans for everything, because it gets them special treatment and money. Europeans are the only people that practice self-reflection, remorse or empathy. Every other people is mostly indifferent to the struggles of the less fortunate. That's what I see anyway.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Lex Non Scripta  dear sir sorry I didn't get back to you sooner but I have a cell phone that doesn't work is good as I would hope . You asked about information about the Vietnam War so here goes. We could have won that war within 4 years. Communism was trying to take over the world at the time they felt that if they could get enough countries to turn communism then we would not stand a chance with the amount of allies we had. First it started in North Korea with \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} China invading. We beat them back but then they started up in Vietnam. By that time the \textbf{fat} cats here in America we're getting rich off the war. They wanted to continue the war so they kept lining the pockets of crooked politicians such as Nixon to keep the war going. Meanwhile the media was making us out to be evil and baby killers which is not true. But they got the attention of the young people here in America calling themselves hippies and they started protesting against the war in New York and the Pentagon to the point where they got Congress to stop funding the war. Nixon had no choice but to pull out because he had no money to continue. That is when we abandoned the South Vietnamese people. They were crying out for help from America because they could not stand against \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} China they wanted to be a democracy just like USA. But because of greed they lost their country and we lost the war. After we left houses upon thousands of South Vietnamese people were either enslaved in prison or just murdered. Just one more shame to add to our list. Many people have watched the show Star Trek and seeing the shows about the Borg invasion. Where they say resistance is futile. Where they say you will be assimilated and become a borg. That is exactly what we did to the Native American Indians. Many \textbf{African} Americans complain and holler about slavery but in that time slavery was all over the world. Slavery did not know color nor did it no Fame or wealth you and I could be crossing the Atlantic and be taken over by Pirates and the next thing you know we could be in some foreign country being sold that was the way of the world at that time. The only reason they get the recognition is because they holler and scream about it so much and demand restitution. If the \textbf{Indian} \textbf{Nation} would have stuck together as tribes they could have conquered the white man and even kept out all French Spanish and British but they were not United and still are not. Have you ever heard the saying the squeaky wheel gets the grease that is why the blacks in America get the attention they get because they are the squeaky wheel. But the Indians of our country remain silent therefore they get \textbf{nothing} only the squeaky wheel gets the grease. Ever since the beginning of Native Americans throughout South America and North America all the way up to Alaska they have never gotten along with different tribes. The lesson to learn here is united we stand divided we fall. If we do not unite as a country soon then we will fall as well. I hope I answered your question. If you have any others feel free to ask that's how we all learn.

That's gratitude for you huh. But I did not know that they saved Andrew Jackson's life tell me more about that would you? You know if the Sioux \textbf{Nation} had not killed custard he would have become president. Can you imagine such a person being president oh wait we had one like him Andrew Jackson. These people should not be honored or on any money. Custard had the audacity to have a band play music as he marched into butcher women and children. But there was one lesson learned in that battle and that is United the Indians could have conquered but they were not United only in that one battle. Also they should have learn more about the white man armory. Yes they stole rifles and bought but that does no good against cannons.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Buba Jackson Like I said, hidden mega genocide of indigenous native Americans, and their population in continents of America some five hundred years ago was around 15 millions, while European population in Europe was around 20 millions. Today, Native population at 15 million, while European population ( in continents of America + Europe) at a staggering 'One Billion'. History is written by the victors. Remember the well-known story told was that the indigenous Native people of America continents, who had no prior contact with White Europeans, were wiped out by diseases brought up by European newcomers when they first came over and occupied the land. Here's the analysis. How come another Indigenous \textbf{African} slaves that were brought over from remote West Africa, deepest part of Africa, who also had no prior contact with White Europeans,  were not wiped out by diseases? The other story told was 'Cowboys and Indians'. The story goes like that native Indians were slaughtered by Cowboys. But what really happened to indigenous Native Americans, so-called Indians, and the real life story was further from the truth. In reality, they were slaughtered not only by cowboys, but most by settlers, civilian militias, military, and all are backed by general populace, the country and the government, as a whole, since every groups had \textbf{nothing} to lose but more to gain. The plain truth, of course, is that the indigenous native Americans were all slaughtered in order to get their land, plain and simple! Imagine what would it be like today if Native Americans had possessed some sort of nuclear weapons to defend themselves, and their beloved motherlands from Colonizers? In my humble opinion, the indigenous Natives still would get to hold of the wealth of their bountiful lands intact, as well as their population grew to a good several hundred millions, comparable to that of European population today, no doubt about that.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small many germans came well after slavery was abolished. My ancestors did. We had \textbf{nothing} to do with slavery, yet, because I have white skin, im blamed for it. So \textbf{dumb}, and historically inaccurate. Slavery was normal and was not based on \textbf{race} for millennia. People seem to ignore the fact, that slavery was ended by western philosophy in America. Rooting out slavery around the world, was a trend that started with Anglo-Saxon American men, that are now labeled the worst humans on earth, all while slavery still exist in Africa, by africans!America became the beacon of freedom, that the world tried to mimic, but always failed at doing so, so instead, everyone just packed there bags and moved to America, like a smart person would. Yet, with all this prosperity, America has to have the most ungrateful citizens on earth. We all live as one in one country, but the "natural bush man" that is the native, doesn't want white skinned people sharing the land because his ancestors "stole" it?First off.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Amigo Kandu Do you forget the little known mega genocide of indigenous native Americans, and their population in continents of America 500 yrs ago was around 15 millions, while European population in Europe was around 20 millions. Today, Native population at 15 million, while European population ( in continents of America + Europe) at 'ONE BILLION'. History is written by the victors. Remember the story told was that the indigenous Native people of America continents, who had no prior contact with White Europeans, were wiped out by diseases brought up by European newcomers when they first came over and occupied the land. Here's the analysis. How come another Indigenous \textbf{African} slaves that were brought over from remote West Africa, deepest part of Africa, who also had no prior contact with White Europeans,  were not wiped out by diseases? The other story told was 'Cowboys and Indians'. The story goes like that native Indians were slaughtered by Cowboys. But what really happened to indigenous Native Americans, so-called Indians, and the real life story was further from the truth. In reality, they were slaughtered not only by cowboys, but most by settlers, civilian militias, military, and all are backed by general populace, the country and the government, as a whole, since every groups had \textbf{nothing} to lose but more to gain. The plain truth, of course, is that the indigenous native Americans were all slaughtered in order to get their land, plain and simple!

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Facts:1.  There was no America before the Europeans arrived.  Prior to that, you had various \textbf{Indian} tribes who were fighting amongst each other.  There is also evidence to suggest that some of them took land from other indigenous people before.  Indians supported the right of conquest.2.  \textbf{Indian} tribes were said to be 7,000 years behind in terms of technology, inventions and ideas compared to the arriving Europeans.  That means you had a very sizeable difference between the New and \textbf{Old} World.  Like it or not, change was going to happen in the New World one way or the other so it could catch up with the \textbf{Old} World.3.  The BBC is being selective in its story telling although that is \textbf{nothing} new.  They cherry picked the poorest of Indians and ignored other Indians that are doing quite well in America.  For example, because Indians have dual citizenship and reservations are sovereign nations, they are able to take advantage of certain laws such as gambling laws that are not available to other Americans.  Also,  a number of Indians have become wealthy through oil and gas and other types of mineral drilling.  4.  The BBC also is throwing around alcoholism stats as if that is the fault of Europeans.  But \textbf{nobody} is forcing Indians to drink.  Also, in many places that have a large number of Indians, the state governments have actually required beer companies to dilute the \textbf{alcohol} content to help protect Indians.  The BBC is also ignoring the genetic issue which is that Indians are more predisposed to the negative effects of \textbf{alcohol}.  Finally, Indians introduced tobacco smoking to the Europeans but \textbf{nobody} is blaming the Indians for all the resulting deaths and health problems created by that phenomenon.  5.  The drug issue is not unique to \textbf{Indian} reservations.  It has become a problem in a lot of rural America.  It is a situation where young people feel they have \textbf{nothing} better to do with their time and get hooked on these drugs out of boredom.  It is terribly sad but this is not unique to Indians.  This is partly an economic problem where a prior taking away of manufacturing jobs had left a large part of  America with limited immediate opportunities.  But at least we now have a President that is trying to bring some manufacturing back to the US.  In addition, governments are taking some actions on these issues to limit certain drugs but this is a multi-faceted problem.   6.  As the video suggests, many Indians are not taking advantage of all the opportunities available to them.  That is where outreach needs to happen because they are offered other opportunities over "white European" Americans in terms of scholarships, lower test score requirements for schools, receiving extra points for federal and state government positions, etc.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Indian, Nobody, Nothing, Old, alcohol & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s, Age - Youngsters, Behavioural Addiction - Alcohol, Ethnicity - Native-American & \cellcolor{green!27}11/469 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.345 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small (first draft) If I was a governor or president, I'd explain how God's Blood Covenant People broke fellowship with God's Spirit Of Equal Representation by signing "The 1783 Treaty Of Paris", which was an agreement with England to beguile, lie, cheat and militarily bully \textbf{Indian} \textbf{nation}'s out of their ancestral land (See The Western Confederation and Tecumseh's Confederation). Note: \textbf{Indian} \textbf{nation}'s relied upon British Support. During the course of war The British disengaged support by retreating or closing the gates of refuge for Indians. It was a long term military war maneuver to divide, humiliate, demoralize, dominate and destroy A United American Culture's Soul? "If you are cut down during a movement designed to save ( clear, complete and free) the soul of a \textbf{nation}, no other death can be more redemptive.

Present Short term Ignorance (\textbf{mental} block) cannot understand how a provocative Treaty broke fellowship with God's designed Peace (Equal Representation for All People living in American Culture). "The power wielders cry peace! peace! with unsheathed swords instead of extending olive branches." "For Centuries, millions of people have been cheated, restitution is a costly process." - MLK - P.S.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Do you know the fact that Indigenous Native Americans had built such great civilizations as Mayan, Inca and Aztec without outside help, and all from the scratch, and all on their own, since they had been cut off from the rest of the world for ten of thousand of years. In other words, they actually are great and proud people. All they need is their beloved father lands back, the lands that their ancestors had lived through thick and \textbf{thin}, endured through hardships and all. Moreover, the hidden mega genocide of indigenous native American population in continents of America 500 yrs ago was around 15 millions, while European population in Europe was around 20 millions. Today, Native population at 15 million, while European population ( in continents of America + Europe) at a staggering 'ONE BILLION'! For instance, 200 years ago in USA, about 3 million Germans came, and now there are 65 millions German-Americans; while 150 years ago, 2 millions Irish came, and now there are 45 million Irish-Americans. While 500 years ago there were estimated 5 to 6 millions Native people in USA, before Christopher Columbus, today there are about 2 million indigenous Native Americans survived. What would it be like today if native Americans have possessed some sort of nuclear weapons to defend themselves? The answer is they would still have their own beloved motherlands, plus their population comparable to that of European population. I've no doubt about that. In my humble opinion, it's about time to decolonize the Colonized lands, and return it to rightful owners Native American people. remember, notorious Slavery as well as Colonialism had long been over, why on earth is this another notorious Colonization still lingering on? As a matter of fact, China has made no secret that it would one day help liberate continents of America which it sees as rightfully belonging to Indigenous Native people.

"The ArabMoors were perceived as, and indeed were,a liberating force."(Stillman, p. 53) Theblack Mooslimswere greeted byJoos eager to aid them in administering the country. In many conquered towns the garrison was left in the hands of theJoos before the Mooslimsproceeded further north. Thus came the,"Golden \textbf{Age}" for SpanishJoos. The following quote is self-explanatory. It was written in 1912 by the CommunistJoo,Israel Cohen, taken from his book; 'A RacialProgram For The Twentieth Century', and entered into the Congressional Record on June 17, 1957, volume 103, page 8559: 'We must realize that our party's most powerful weapon isracial tensions. By propounding into the consciousness of the darkracesthat for centuries they have been oppressedbywhites, we can mold them to the program of the COMMUNISTPARTY. In America we will aim for subtle victory. While inflaming the Negrominority against theWhites, we will endeavor to instill in thewhites a guilt complex for their exploitation of theNegroes.This is what Trotsky, a Joo, was preparing theRussians for with the for with the implementation of Communismwhich KarlMarx (author of the CommunistManifesto1848), another Joo, based on the BabylonianTalmud forGentiles: "We should turn Her(Russia) into a desert populated withwhiteNgers. We will impose upon them such a tyranny that was never dreamt by the most hideous despots of the East. The peculiar trait of that tyranny is that it will be enacted from the left rather than the right and it will be \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} rather thanwhite in color. Its color will be \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} literally because we would spill such torrents of blood that they will pale all human losses of the capitalist wars and make the survivors shudder.Comanches came in and took the land from the Apaches by war, Aztecs, Incas and Mayans all grew their empires by conquering lands from other tribes. The Tainos and Canib tribes fought over land. When Spain Defeated the Aztec empire, the did so with an army of 1,000 Spanish soldiers and 75,000 soldiers from the Tlaxcallans, Choulatecs and Totonac tribes.. The practice of claiming the land of conquered enemies extended well past the colonization of America. It wasn't until the conclusion of World War II in 1945 that western culture shunned the practice (and even then, the Soviet Union claimed Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Austria, and many other territories as part of their victory spoils). To claim 'whiteEuropeans' 'stole' America from the native tribes is to force the cultural norms of the past 50 years (that whiteEuropeans created) on events that happened hundreds of years earlier. That is just ignorant. steal-americaAnother problem I have with the 'Whitepeople stole America from the Natives' mentality is that it is insulting to NativeAmericans. It portrays them as ignorant fools easily duped by the evil white man. When, in fact, the brave NativeAmerican tribes fought hard, vicious battles to preserve their lands. The United States Census Bureau in 1894 counted over 40 wars involvingwhite' Americans and Native Americans between the years 1789 and 1846, which killed 19,000 whites and about 30,000 Indians. During these wars Native Americans committed atrocities against the white settlers. Slaughtering whole towns, raping, scalping, and murdering children were regular acts. During the Pontiacs War in 1764, 4 Delaware \textbf{Indian} Warriors entered a settlers log schoolhouse. There, they killed and scalped the teacher, and nine children. Two children were scalped, but survived their injuries, and 4 other children were taken prisoners. This is the first schoolmassacre on record in America (and it happened before America was even a \textbf{nation}). As you can see, to claim that NativeAmericans were peace loving nomads that were fooled by the whitepeople is just plain ignorant. If there is one thing we can learn from the Native Americans loss of land to white settlers, it is that we need to have tighter control over our immigration policies. The Native Americans believed that the firstEuropean settlers were just refugees trying to escape persecution in their homeland. They thought the American continent was large enough and the resources plentiful enough that they could share it with a few of these foreigners. But soon, these few turned into many, and the many demanded more. Soon the demands turned into violent conflicts, and the NativeAmericans were trapped in warfare with the new 'immigrants'. The colonists eventually conquered the Native Americans and claimed the land as spoils of war. History repeats itself, and if we are not wary these new waves of undocumented immigrants, and refugees will soon be waging war on us.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Conflicts continued into the 1790s. A 1792 treaty created a boundary between Cherokee and White settlers. The United States government promised to protect the Cherokee land from further settlement. But as White settlement continued, the federal government began thinking about removing the Cherokee and other Native Americans living east of the Mississippi River. In 1838 President Martin Van Buren acted on a policy established earlier by Andrew Jackson and sent federal troops to forcibly remove the Cherokee to the newly established \textbf{Indian} Territory in present-day Oklahoma. About twenty thousand Cherokee were forced to leave. The path they took has been called the Trail of Tears because so many died on this journey west.Some Cherokee avoided the troops and stayed behind in North Carolina. They joined the Oconaluftee Cherokee Indians, who, because of an 1819 treaty, were allowed to stay in North Carolina. Together, their descendants make up the Eastern Band of the Cherokee and now live in the Qualla Boundary, a reservation in five different counties in western North Carolina. Several other modern Native American groups, such as the Lumbee, the Haliwa-Saponi, and the Coharie, live in North Carolina.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Give me a break. Does anyone with any brains ever think, gee I wonder who the Indians stole the land from? The natives were not the first people. They butchered the people who were in the US and took it years before whites showed up. Before whites settled the area, Mexicans and Indians were huge slave traders. Part of what the Indians and Mexicans hated about the white man, was that he wanted to end slavery. Everyone acts like these people were just innocent peaceful people. Indians were mass murders and slave traders like the Mexicans of each other. When whites expected them to stop the slave trading they didnt like that, and it created a war. Why do you think all those tribes were full of men with 5-10 wives? Every time Indians invaded another tribe, they would select a new wife. They did a lot of inner tribal wife trading too. Liberal media has twisted all the truth about the past to make it look like everyone is innocent except the evil white man, which is horse shit. Even the narrative about Indians being at one with nature is a joke. They would hunt and farm areas to the point that they were barren wastelands. Everyone likes to pin this behavior on the evil white, but the truth is, whites knew about farming and hunting and realized you had to treat the animal life and farm land correctly or it would turn to ash. Its why mass expanses of \textbf{Indian} landscape looks post apocalyptic because they didnt know any better and would farm it beyond its limit and fish the streams empty.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The white \textbf{race} has a lot to account for in recent times, although it is his ways that have become too prevalent now amongst all races. Unlike many of the \textbf{old} tribes peoples, he had no spiritual connection to the Great Spirit and Creator, and so the decay and destruction of the human \textbf{race} and the earth was bound to ensue, just like the Grail legends of \textbf{old} foretold, the power and radiation needed to sustain all of us has been almost severed. And now men are empty and desolate within, and so reach out with oft uncontrollable compulsive urges for immediate gratification in all earthly spheres, and let their rotten desires run riot. It was the white men that really excelled in these excesses, and with the ecological destruction and genocide of the now American continent and its races, they perpetuated probably the greater disaster of the modern \textbf{age}, certainly since the fall of Atlantis.The good news for kindred spirits is that like Atlantis, mankind must now reap what they have sown, and most of the fruits are evil, and so extra light power coming onto the earth, will now bring destruction into all these channels, thus purifying the earth and ridding it of this burdensome dross. Then the world can return to a way of life akin to that of the tribes people, who lived far more in harmony with nature, and who had connections to spiritual guidance too to support them with wisdom in their way of living. This is partly why many lofty spirits incarnated into the indigenous tribes during their struggles of the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries in particular, to help keep alive the hope of a better way of life, and for the freedom and strength of their spirits for later incarnations in various races.The book the 'Return of the Bird Tribes' discusses these issues within the great Wheel of Reincarnation, and speaks how one day, after the ways of the white man have been annulled, the original tribes, if they have lived well in further reincarnations, will return to the American lands, and the white men, along with their culture, will be either be completely exterminated, or forcibly removed from the land there. Many prophecies speak of this time, and it is good to see that people are awakening to the Great Spirit once again, for it is only out of reverence for Him, and gratitude for the gift of life that he imparted upon us, that we can once again begin to live on earth in the desired way, so that our spirits may be uplifted through the blessings we can then reap, and so on completing our evolution here on earth, return to the blessed lands of eternal and luminous beauty!

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Oh yeah after the genocide we were so much better off. What helped us even more was when they violated the treaties and took the rest of what little land we had left forcing us onto reservations. Forcing us to rely on government rations. Then being assimilated just to completely destroy our culture and way of life also helped a lot. this all translated to how well we are doing today. Still forced to live on reserves due to generational oppression and stereo typical opinions. Which leads to being landless jobless and relying on welfare. How many years white people wouldn't/wont even build water pipe lines to reserves. That doesn't stop them from building pipelines for oil right through our territory though. All they had to do was pay the chief who is probably a true 5 dollar \textbf{indian} anyway. Meanwhile the jews get a whole country and billions a year as reparation for genocide when britain and the US had \textbf{nothing} to do with the jewish genocide but everything to do with the native american genocide.

Evil is in all mankind, not just the ones you choose to hate out of convenience.America is one of the rare countries to tolerate free speech to the degree that minorities can spread hate for white people with little to no reprisal.For the love of all peoples on Earth, please educate yourselves before spreading more needless and mostly groundless hate for the European civilizations and the good individuals in them that spread the principles of freedom and free speech to the rest of the world, despite the bad acts that accompanied that process. The actions of the bad individuals, of which there were admittedly many, doesn't condemn the whole \textbf{race} or our good country. Show me a place on earth with perfect equality and fairness, with no misdeeds on its historical conscience. Hint for you--it doesn't exist. But if you really must out of spite declare war on the whites, then do it and be ready to fight like creatures with spines. Don't stay in the places that we mostly built and cowardly spread hate for us right amongst us, being protected and supported by our institutions all the same.No people should have to feel ashamed for what they are, including our people, especially when we have tangibly accomplished so much for the world. Even this platform you use to spread hate speech was mostly developed by white people.Shame on you \textbf{racist}, entitled cowards.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Race, Racist & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/288 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.694 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Sushil Kumar America was not stolen. America was conquered. There is a big difference. If you don't understand that simple fact then I suggest you go research and learn about World History. It's not nice, it's not pretty, but it's reality. If you are going to cry about being conquered them go do something about it and stop crying. Also, if you think native Americans were living in peace with no issues here before Europeans came then once again go research. If Spaniards took land from one tribe, and that tribe had took that land from another tribe and another other tribe had taken that land from ANOTHER tribe then who has true ownership of that land? How can it be determined who should get that land? Who were the true bad people of this situation? Example: There were Central American tribes that did HORRIFIC things to other tribes and "stole" their land and raped their women and enslaved the men. But what the \textbf{common} uneducated belief is that they were all living here dancing with the animals and helping each other and living in total peace until those darn Europeans came and "stole" the land. PLEASE people, go get educated. Research, question, and analyze. You will find that every single culture or \textbf{race} has had times when they they were the victims and times when they were the antagonists.   PLEASE get educated. Also, since every culture or \textbf{race} has been victimized or oppressed at one time or another then NO ONE wants to hear you whine or cry. Go do something about it or stop complaining.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Bold-Ochir Batbayar Before I respond, I just have to say I love the how detailed and the way you formed your arguments in readable way. Beautiful workResponse to 1st argument:According to google, the definition of treatment means the behavior in which someone behaves towards someone. So statistics of 'graduation rates' doesn't necessarily prove the general treatment that White Americans have towards native Americans. These stats don't say they're not receiving diplomas because of their \textbf{ethnic} group primarily. As for police brutality I need a specific number per year of how many times that happens instead of percents because if a percent represents a number then what is that number? In my opinion 1.9 isn't high compared to other \textbf{ethnic} groups such as \textbf{black} and Latinos, heck even whites according to statistics.com majority of people killed by cops last year 2018 were white. whites 399 and 'other 34'(which are probably native Americans. Overall these stats don't prove \textbf{racism} and horrible treatment. I never heard in modern society of a Native American getting victimized to violence because they were categorized as 'native Americans' Also with population, I don't really have an argument against it since out of 300 million people in this country 245 million of them happen to be white according to Wikipedia. In my humble opinion other \textbf{ethnic} groups 'minority's' in the US should be happy \textbf{racism} isn't a problem like it was in the 50s other otherwise we're in deep shit with these numbers 😂2nd argument response:I'm not arguing about what's moral because of course evolution and nature isn't moral. Although I do believe in a violence free world, that be great! And we humans are at least trying to change that by creating laws of not killing or creating religion and rules. But in nature and evolution that's not the case, killing and stealing is in our nature for survival our biological purposes in this planet is to survive and replicate and do anything it takes to achieve this. Don't argue with me on whether or not this moral or justifiable because I'm with you on this... I don't like wars, \textbf{racism}, and some being strong or some being weak. I wish we're all equal. But in the eyes of evolution we're not so that's why there's a food chain in the world. Us humans at the top and maybe another animal like rabbit at the bottom. A long time ago dinosaur used to be at the top till their era ended, now it's ours. If you want someone to argue with, argue with god and we he created such a world to began with. 3rdI'm \textbf{black} (just to get that out the way) and no I don't think whites are superior to the native Americans \textbf{race} (honestly I think all races have at least one or two people in it who are smart and have enough brain capacity to do smart shit like build a rocket ship to the moon). I'm just stating that the native Americans were not technically advanced in their military at the time to combat outsiders just like if The USA military isn't strong (especially without the threat of nuclear weapons) countries like Russia and China could possible invade us to aid their own. And native Americans were also fighting other Native American tribes at the time which also lowered their chances of winning that war.

Natives were displaced over a 100 years ago, and Africa is targeting whites TODAY. Trying to lay claim to who the Country was named after by citing other speculation is weak.  No one can claim concrete evidence, thats why they are called beliefs and speculations.The british colonized the area and decided on the Name fundamentally (you can look up the word fundamental) since the ITALIANS didn't have a final word in the process and the colonist later became founding fathers who named the country respectively.  The arguments over the name have both been debated equally.  and AGAIN these were my words that you read incorrectly too busy pounding your chest and rolling your fist over a keyboard "It is also believed that the U.S. was Named after Richard..."

The natives fought themselves to claim land, Asia battled over land and spaniards tried to claim land of the aztecs....etc.  it happened over a 100 years so why pinpoint one that isn't happening NOW.White farmers in Africa are being targeted ONLY because of their \textbf{race}, and even Africa's version of the president admitted it.  Africa is hurting for economic status so they need all the land that was bought and paid for back and white farmers DO need to leave since the country isn't stable.

I feel the same way for nations such as the US, Australia, South Africa, etc. I don't believe in the violence and conflict between natives and the foreign descendants.

Three of the sites are on the Delmarva Peninsular in Maryland, discovered by archaeologist Dr Darrin Lowery of the University of Delaware. One is in Pennsylvania and another in Virginia.

The ultimate goal is to prove that we are not trying to bury them in debt, but to give them the start of a new legacy as a people. It's time to bless them. As we are expecting a wall to built between Mexico, we should also make efforts for walls to be torn down with respect to the lack of aid/communication to Native Tribes.*It's time to help them to build websites for their businesses to sell items. It's time to teach each tribe to have designated plumbers and repairmen within their territories. This country needs to get them to a point where they feel like they belong, and that we for once, recognized the need to make things better. They need to know that we are evolving as a \textbf{nation} UNITED! We need to help them to place of pride and sustainability. We need to hear the voices and be honest enough to change things.*Build factories and get them equipment that will allow the tribes access to their own tools to make clothing and jewelry. We need to train family tribes for trades that allow them to cater to their own needs if that be their preference. This would allow them to evolve and provide for themselves, but also to know that there are options for training. It also opens up the American culture back to the Native American culture through art. Expression through art is a universal language and a strong tool for education.*Put a team together to figure out a path for the young ones to easily apply for college, which will begin to put a dent in this wrath of alcoholism.

He did this for some 60 other people and found they were all Jewish even though they claimed "pure" Native American heritage. So yes, if Mexico was "conquered by the evil whites" as our "History texts" so claim wouldn't all Mexicans today be blonde haired with blue eyes like the Norwegians are?

They discovered her and her sisters remains and they had expected the DNA to match the modern native Americans DNA but instead they found,  they had come from white European people... this group of ancient people branched off from their ancestors,  the modern Europeans around 25,000 years ago and made their way to North America via Alaska,  when a frozen land bridge made the crossing from Europe and Asia to North America possible. These ancient Europeans then pushed south as the ice caps melted and mixed with the Asians who had also crossed which created the modern Native American people, this is why many Native Americans have European features...These ancient European and Asian people are the ancestors of the Native American people!!.. they were the first people to settle on the land so when white European settlers rediscovered the Americas again,  they weren't invading it because was their people who once lived there and the Natives originally came from the Europeans,  newest evidence on the origin of humans suggests that it was Europe and not Africa like the originally had thought.The evidence doesn't support that white Europeans destroyed every civilizations but it does show that they had a part in creating nearly every society...if humans first came from around Europe...and it's also not just a "white European" thing unfortunately it is an every race culture thing...the Asians and the Arabs also invaded and stole land from people the Arabs stolen the whole of North Africa slaughtering the native people who lived there and the world's worst dictatorships that have come from many Asian who are responsible for the most deaths in the history of mankind Africans slaughtered each other and captured and sold rival tribe members into slavery and raped their \textbf{woman} .. so you see history shows that no race culture is absolutely perfect... we all have human flaws,  so isn't time we moved on and learn from our ancestors mistakes and their ignorance... let's learn that hating and destroying each other doesn't help us as the past so clearly shows.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/404 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.495 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The fact that history continues to be whitewashed should say alot. 1) Mercator map projection: This map that is globally used, demonstrates the very nature of intellectual hegemony. In the map, North America and Europe are made much larger than they actually are, which surely fit the needs of the German monarchs who commissioned Mercator. And Google definitely carries on in the same tradition. Just so you know, Africa is 3-4x bigger than North America and Europe. 2) History taught in schools everywhere focus on Post-Industrial Revolution Europe mainly, with much references to Rome and the Macedonian  Alexander. World history texts conveniently omit the advanced civilisations of the Indians (Mohenjo-Daro/Harrappa), Chinese, Göbekli Tepe, Sumerians, Babylonians, Norse, etc. Like so in academia, where most of the overly influential elite reside in Europe, with research institutions, think-tanks, publications, and every sort of influence/money/power resides. Funny how education and intellectualism is so closely linked to money and power huh.3) All this is coupled with whitewashed history, are the institutions of business corporations and the media. Both of these are consistently overrepresented by Western Europeans following the Colonial period into the current Ideological/Economic hegemony of the West. Everything traded in the world somehow is pegged to USD and mostly traded to European middlemen before heading to the rest of the world. And of course, the giant corporations have the say in the overpriced final products we consume daily. Look at \textbf{Apple} products that are wildly overpriced from the initial raw materials extracted from \textbf{African} nations like Congo. It's the same for the oil industry and every raw material being used today. It's all a Centralised planned market for the materials and products.Likewise, the media is mostly confined to the syndicated news of Reuters, AP and AFP. The whole push that got the world looking at Muslims as terrorists when modern terrorism was founded by the Zionist Lehigh, Haganah, Irgun, etc. It's amazing results of indoctrination that the media echo chamber produces. Meanwhile, Hollywood and every advertising agency consistently portray Westerners as the pinnacle of society.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Dear American people. You are right it is the greatest disgrace of America what we have done to the Native Indians. Even John F Kennedy said so himself. There is people that believe that when God comes back and takes back the Earth and is in charge that the meek shall inherit the earth. I hope the Native Indians get their country back at that time. A long time ago when the Indians were losing their land their way of life their language everything was being stolen from them by the European Invaders. I am proud that I am American I am a \textbf{disabled} Vietnam vet who probably fought for this country. But I also am a historian. And I know the truth. There has been great medicine men that have been told by God in their dreams that they will someday reclaim their land. I believe this will happen. Just like the land that belongs to Israel and it's people and their land was taken by Invaders that now call themselves Palestinians that is what happened here in America. One day Israel will reclaim all of its land given to them by God and the same will happen here in North America. To any Native Americans out there reading my comment. The times have changed. God will soon be coming back and he will set things right. I personally feel the pain that you have had to endure as much as a white man can. I personally would like to apologize for my ancestors. You true Americans open up your arms and give us a great deal of your land teaches how to hunt and Farm in this new land all you ask is that we respect your land your hunting grounds and your sacred burial grounds and white man said fuck you and took it anyway because they were greedy and Evil. Don't worry God has seen all of our sins. One day your sacred Land will be long to you again. So teach your culture your language your history to your children so that it will never go extinct. I am not saying that there was not bad Indians in that time there is bad people in all raices. There were bad Indians that were murdering and raping and kidnapping children of other tribes this is the way of life there was good and evil and it will be so until God comes back. I personally choose to embrace the good the love of God. And I share that love with all humans and all of God's creation. I want her to Native American say that \textbf{Indian} Sea Life in a different way they see life in everything The Rock the mountains the Earth itself the sky the waters everything has life in it. But it is said that the white man sees death in everything the stone is dead the mountain is dead the Earth is dead so why not destroy it.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Spain 694, Jews were accused of conspiring with the Muslims across the Mediterranean. "The Arab Moors were perceived as, and indeed were, a liberating force." (Stillman, p. 53) The (\textbf{Black}) Muslims were greeted by Jews eager to aid them in administering the country. In many conquered towns the garrison was left in the hands of the Jews before the Muslims proceeded further north. Thus came the, "Golden \textbf{Age}" for Spanish Jews. The following quote is self-explanatory. It was written in 1912 by the \textbf{Communist} Jew, Israel Cohen, taken from his book; ' A Racial Program For The Twentieth Century', and entered into the Congressional Record on June 17, 1957, volume 103, page 8559: 'We must realize that our party's most powerful weapon is racial tensions. By propounding into the consciousness of the dark races that for centuries they have been oppressed by whites, we can mold them to the program of the \textbf{COMMUNIST} PARTY. In America we will aim for subtle victory. While inflaming the \textbf{Negro} minority against the Whites, we will endeavor to instill in the whites a guilt complex for their exploitation of the Negroes. We will aid the Negroes to rise in prominence in every walk of life, in the professions and in the world of sports and entertainment. With this prestige, the \textbf{Negro} will be able to intermarry with the whites and begin a process which will deliver America to our cause.' ~ Israel Cohen This is what Trotsky, a Jew, was preparing the Russians for with the implementation of Communism, which Karl Marx (author of the \textbf{Communist} Manifesto 1848), another Jew, based on the Babylonian Talmud for Gentiles: "We should turn Her (Russia) into a desert populated with white N*ggers. We will impose upon them such a tyranny that was never dreamt by the most hideous despots of the East. The peculiar trait of that tyranny is that it will be enacted from the left rather than the right and it will be \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} rather than white in color. Its color will be \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} literally because we would spill such torrents of blood that they will pale all human losses of the capitalist wars and make the survivors shudder." The native Americans are not native to America at all can you just remember 'native' Americans derived from mongols in Eurasia they crossed the baring strait from Asia learn your history boy The so-called 'native' Americans have their chance to make America theirs but they lost the war America is not stolen it is conquered America is founded and built by Europeans and for Europeans America is a European country and it should stay that way.Comanches came in and took the land from the Apaches by war, Aztecs, Incas and Mayans all grew their empires by conquering lands from other tribes. The Tainos and Canib tribes fought over land. When Spain Defeated the Aztec empire, the did so with an army of 1,000 Spanish soldiers and 75,000 soldiers from the Tlaxcallans, Choulatecs and Totonac tribes.. The practice of claiming the land of conquered enemies extended well past the colonization of America. It wasn't until the conclusion of World War II in 1945 that western culture shunned the practice (and even then, the Soviet Union claimed Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Austria, and many other territories as part of their victory spoils). To claim 'white Europeans' 'stole' America from the native tribes is to force the cultural norms of the past 50 years (that white Europeans created) on events that happened hundreds of years earlier. That is just ignorant. steal-americaAnother problem I have with the 'White people stole America from the Natives' mentality is that it is insulting to Native Americans. It portrays them as ignorant fools easily duped by the evil white man. When, in fact, the brave Native American tribes fought hard, vicious battles to preserve their lands. The United States Census Bureau in 1894 counted over 40 wars involving 'white' Americans and Native Americans between the years 1789 and 1846, which killed 19,000 whites and about 30,000 Indians. During these wars Native Americans committed atrocities against the white settlers. Slaughtering whole towns, raping, scalping, and murdering children were regular acts. During the Pontiacs War in 1764, 4 Delaware \textbf{Indian} Warriors entered a settlers log schoolhouse. There, they killed and scalped the teacher, and nine children. Two children were scalped, but survived their injuries, and 4 other children were taken prisoners. This is the first school massacre on record in America (and it happened before America was even a \textbf{nation}). As you can see, to claim that Native Americans were peace loving nomads that were fooled by the white people is just plain ignorant. If there is one thing we can learn from the Native Americans loss of land to white settlers, it is that we need to have tighter control over our immigration policies. The Native Americans believed that the first European settlers were just refugees trying to escape persecution in their homeland. They thought the American continent was large enough and the resources plentiful enough that they could share it with a few of these foreigners. But soon, these few turned into many, and the many demanded more. Soon the demands turned into violent conflicts, and the Native Americans were trapped in warfare with the new 'immigrants'. The colonists eventually conquered the Native Americans and claimed the land as spoils of war. History repeats itself, and if we are not wary these new waves of undocumented immigrants, and refugees will soon be waging war on us.

The horse(introduced by Spaniards to the Natives) made hunting and navigation much faster and efficient. Instead of doing dangerous traps which often resulted in being trampled by a buffalo,  a Native could shoot it from a distance on horseback. Not to mention other additions like the gun, architecture, more functional clothing, religion etc. 5 tribes actually embraced the White's presence and created towns similar to white settlers(The 5 Civilized Tribes).

Namely, the 48 states of the Continental US.The sad truth is that nature determined that the fittest survive. It's a truth that has existed longer than America and the Native Americans who lived here before.The sad truth is that the early American settlers will fit and willing to take this land for themselves, and that isn't the fault of modern-day Americans born centuries after many key events of the colonization of this land by the early Europeans.The people of today are not accountable for the decisions of people who have literally been dead 100+ years, but are responsible for themselves and the communities and leaders that exist today in the present.Today, America is a world superpower. It doesn't matter if you hate America or not, you cannot deny this fact.These people can do something to get out of their poverty: Move to the United States.As in, off the reservation essentially.The US government already gives them so much welfare and assistance,  but respecting their sovereignty as their own \textbf{nation} (tribe) and ability to self-govern means they are necessarily separate from the United States of America.If you want the Federal Government to fund/support these reservations, how much different is that from the reservations simply being absorbed into the US?If the Federal Government is supposed to (according to some people's opinions) support these reservations the same ways they support the 50 states, then that means they aren't truly independent (for needing so much assistance from the US) and are, in fact, essentially part of the United States themselves.You can't have the best of both worlds; you're either part of the US or begging to eat leftovers from their table.It's NOT how I personally like it to be, but reality is that this is simply the way it is.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nation & \cellcolor{green!5}Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/370 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.27 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Why do accept these retarded claims that America is on stolen land. 1 \textbf{nobody} owns an entire continent except god.     2 when the white man came across the Atlantic and began to colonize America and Canada 400 years ago the North American continent was very sparsely populated with small pockets of native tribes scattered throughout and they were very hostile to each other. There was no centralized government body that linked the tribes together. There was no system of justice or legal property ownership. Everything including land was taken or lost by force, war and violence. It was survial of the fittest and large more dominant tribes would conquer land from smaller weaker tribes often making the prisoners slaves. 3 the white man did not steal any rescourse from the natives. No person or people can own rescources only god can. Rescourses are only priced to reflect the amount of work that was involved in extracting, shipping, refining, etc. When the white man came here there was no functioning mines, saw mills, only bare land.4 If the white man stole this country from the natives then why do they have equal rights or even more at times, equal freedoms and privileges, the ability to vote. If we stole this country then wouldn't they get \textbf{nothing}? 4 what do natives want the ability to have complete control over America.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small This Land was stolen from those that labored for centuries to make it great! Namely the Native Americans. When the Europeans arrived in the New World they discovered a Land flowing with Milk and honey, a far cry from the vast wastelands they left behind. Much of Europe had been ruined by centuries of Wars, over-harvesting, and pollution of vital rivers and streams. Fueled by destructive greed, and an unquenchable thirst for personal fortune and fame the arrival of Europeans caused great turmoil to Africans and people of the Americas. For Centuries these two groups of people worked together, African's had been traveling from various parts of Africa trading with the natives of North and South America. Columbus himself even recorded these facts in his personal journals when told by Native Americans that "\textbf{black} Skinned people had come from the south-east in boats, trading in gold-tipped spears." Never to war or conqueror but Trade! Despite Americas history books what made this Land great was not the arrival of Europeans or the laws written by whites for whites. The Americas were already thriving pre-Columbus as were her people. This Nations Founding Father's stole an already established Land, attempted to claim it for themselves and secure their theft with Laws that were to benefit White People through extermination of the native population and enslaving of others. Sadly most Whites have allowed themselves to become drunk with a false since of pride and entitlement with no idea how these powerful 50 States were built!

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I have always had deep respect for Native American's, as time goes by their original way of life was the way we were intended to live. Most may be poor financially but are very rich in heritage, pride in ancestry and family, they are truly a resilient people. Maybe one day when the rest of Americans kill each other, they will inherit it again.  To answer some of the ignorant and hypocritical people who left derogatory comments, there were war tribes but most were  friendly, passive and trusting people and only fought out of necessity for food and family, even our own history has recorded this, some of the early colonies would have perished without their help with food and knowledge of the lands, now to the hypocritical part, the early settlers of this country considered themselves Christian's but what we did was not at all, I know the difference between right and wrong and what we did and how it was done was wrong, we can not go back and change the passed but we can and should change the future. I wanted to add this quote, it is quite prophetic from 1877 :  The \textbf{R\textbf{ed}} \textbf{Nation} shall rise again and it shall be a blessing for a sick world; a world filled with broken promises, selfishness and separations; a world longing for light again.I see a time of Seven Generations when all the colors of mankind will gather under the Sacred Tree of Life and the whole Earth will become one circle again.In that day, there will be those among the Lakota who will carry knowledge and understanding of unity among all living things and the young white ones will come to those of my people and ask for this wisdom.I salute the light within your eyes where the whole Universe dwells.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small All these idiotic terms being thrown around like 'conquered,' 'more technologically advanced,' 'stolen continent ,' 'no such thing as Native American,' all feed into a narrative of irresponsibility and cherry picked history. Many of you are going to say 'it's just facts, not \textbf{racism},' 'stop being victims,' etc.By making these stances PROVE what the video was explaining. Native Americans still exist, living and breathing now. General perception think of Natives as remnants of the past or as many of you have stated, 'conquered.' Here's the truth...Natives are not Conquered because Native history is woven into the creation of the US. They are connected and can never be separated. But if you must maintain the 'conquered' narrative, let's not forget, it was Native tribes that helped colonists survive and prosper. Once \textbf{fat} and healthy colonist took advantage of that trust and STOLE what wasn't theirs. It wasn't anyone's. It was meant to be shared. Furthermore, tribes were more technologically advanced during this period, but it wasn't used to exterminate white settlers. Again, a trust taken advantage of to the detriment of Native Americans. Secondly, I agree, there's no such thing as 'Native Americans.' But there are Lakota, Arapaho, Navajo, Hopi, Apache, etc, etc, who were here before white settlers. And don't forget, they could've killed off any white settlers because they were (at the time) more technologically and militarily superior. But I guess HUMANITY was lost and forgotten when Washington and his thugs decided they 'owned' these lands. And the MAIN reasons Natives could not hold on to the shared lands were...1. They trusted white settlers2. They helped white settlers in their time of need3. They didn't use their more 'technologically advanced' weapons when they could have4. There were just too many Europeans both in numbers and in greed5. They gave too much credence to the word of European settlersLastly, I'll address the notion of victim hood. Again, I agree that playing victim is an issue, but to totally disregard what was done to Native Americans is plain wrong. It reveals that those who disregard it have never had real loss. Or maybe you have and forgot what you really did lose? That is you have lost your own sense of identity. And waiving the American and Confederate flags are not the white population's truest identity. Maybe one should re-visit that before telling Natives to stop being victims because they know their history, they know where they come from, they know where home is, they know WHO they are, they still have their identity.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small This video is correct, America was stolen by \textbf{racist} white people. However, can someone please tell me how you go back in time and reverse it? We are in 2018. Can we acknowledge that what was done was evil, shouldn't have happened, and focus on what is happening in the world today instead of lamenting on things that happened long before any of us were alive? Evil exists in this world and has since the beginning of time. Man hates man and tries to steal what is not theirs. They kill their fellow man and covet what is not  theirs. Going back in time is great for understanding but at some point you have to acknowledge what was done, forgive and move forward with your life. If you don't you are just going to live a miserable existence. I guarantee that every people group has committed unspeakable acts towards people of a different \textbf{race}. None of us are blameless. You think that the Pawnee, Comanche, Apache, or Cherokee didn't kill, rape, and pillage other tribes? They all did. Evil is evil no matter who's doing it. If you think America was stolen (which it was) then steal it back from the US. Oh wait, you can't because we live in 2018 and the US government have planes, tanks and nukes to quash any uprising. If that's the truth, then whats the point of lamenting over the past other than to make yourself feel more self righteous? The people who committed the unspeakable atrocities towards the Natives are long gone.

It's been there nature for whatever reason (not all but most).I dont quite understand why minorities try to compare whose people suffered more cause that's just stupid \& ignorant.

As for the term "Substance" \& them killing each other here are my thoughts \& examples. 1. If I see you beefing with someone of the same \textbf{ethnic} group \& plotting \& etc.; why would I and folks from the same ethic group as myself lie, steal, rape, kill \& separate families if I'm claiming to be a Christian who loves thy neighbor as thyself? Oh I forgot, because they weren't worshipping the same God as Christians like in the \textbf{Old} Testament so that gives me the right to do the "Lord's Work" and do all of those heinous things that I just mentioned? You do know that the Bible has been remixes/revised or whatever ya wanna say by the Roman Catholic Church as well as King James right?2. If the familiar situation of a complete stranger whom have never seen the likes of comes to you near your home unexpectedly \& doesnt speak your language (maybe there is someone in your home who could understand) asks you to show them to farm, hunt \&etc. And they turn around basically conduct a Genocide on you and your people, how would you take that? Tell me one credible story where minorities have done the same thing to whites/Europeans for land, riches \& resources?!3. Before most parents take you to church...before they take you to school... they teach you hygiene, your name, family history \& heritage, morals, values, respect, religion/faith, love,anger, sadness \&happiness \& right from wrong.

You are a man or \textbf{woman} before you know anything else. Yes I did state a family is suppose to each faith but not every family believes in a God.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Since the beginning of time there has been competition or survival of the fittest for resources like food, water, land, etc. and the strongest won out.  Is it not true that tribe fought tribe in the years preceding the discovery of the North American continent?  Is it not true that the victor of these inter-tribal wars took the spoils like horses, weapons, skins, women, children (some to become slaves of the conquering tribe)?  Is it not true that throughout history the stronger took "slaves"?  Slavery in EVERY \textbf{race} is a historical fact!  Have any of you ever asked where and/or how the indigenous peoples came from?  Have any of you ever heard of the migration of early man from the Asian continent over the frozen Bering Straight?  Some of you speak of "Mexican" land BUT before the Spanish "Conquistadors" came over, Spaniards like Hernan Cortez, the land was inhabited by the Aztecs and Mayans...and again the Aztecs and Mayans and even the indigenous people of South America (Incas of Peru conquered by Pizarro) migrated from Asia.  There was no such thing as "Mexico" or "Mexican" people before Spaniards inter-married/inter-bred with the Aztecs, Mayans or Incas.  So why is it that you (plural and in general) say it was "whites" that "stole" land from the Native Americans or indigenous people?  Have any of you ever wondered who was actually here first?  Why is it that there are many places in North America, Central America and South America that have structures resembling the pyramids of Egypt?  Scientists still argue over just where the "Cradle of Humankind" is but no where do they even consider it to be on the North or South American continents!  So for those of you (plural and in general) that say "go back to where you came from", just where is that?  As for "stolen" land, if it had not been one people or group of people conquering the indigenous people of North America if would have been another.  Fact was/is Native Americans were not strong enough to hold onto what they had just like every other conquered people throughout the history of this planet.  How is your history when it comes to the Louisiana Purchase?  Oh yea, that land was purchased from France...so how did France come to own it?  As for those of you (plural and in general) that say "whites" STOLE land from Mexico that is not true.  The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, signed February 2, 1848, ended the Mexican-American war and Mexico was paid over \$18,000,000.00 for Texas/Mexican bordered being defined and for the what is now California, Nevada, Utah, New Mexico, most of Arizona and Colorado and parts Oklahoma, Kansas and Wyoming.  So if it was paid for how do you call it "stolen".  Get your history and facts straight before playing the blame game.  One more thing to think about.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Yeah the Americas are stolen land. They always have been as far back as we know.Even the term Native American is false. They migrated here from Asia, and encountered people here already, that they took the land from.History is written by the Victors, so in the Paiutes' case, when their ancestors arrived to find people here already, that they called Si-te-cah, they genocided them, claiming "they had to, cuz the Si-te-cah were evil murderous cannibals"..The Incas also stole their land. They stole it from the blue eyed, cloud warriors of Peru, the Chachapoya.There's also physical evidence to back this up, and it all points to this land having been in the hands of many different people, ranging from AmerAsians/Native Americans, to non-European whites, and possibly even an ancient non-"\textbf{African}" \textbf{black} people (judging solely by the appearance of ancient statues found in Central America, that predate the Mayans)What is it about this land, that makes it so desired by so many?Since the world seems ready to turn on it's head, and we can only find descendants of the invading AmerAsians' who stole the land from the inhabitants here before them, sometimes I think the best thing we can do, is go with the continents as they are today, and send 99 of people to live in the continent where most ppl look like them:-whites to Europe-\textbf{black} ppl to Africa (except Aborigines)-Asians to Asia-And the tribes known as Native American, letting them stay in the Americas instead of sending them to Asia. Their history there is too far detached.This would help, if most people returned as stated above, with a few notable exceptions- West Indies \textbf{black} people, who lived in UK for multiple generations, are still Africans, but since they're completely assimilated to UK life, it doesn't cause problems.Islam on the other hand, unless it has its first heavy handed assimilation into Western society, needs to go back to their Islamic countries as well.Unless the assimilated moderates, turn on, and use equally brutal force on the fundamentalist Muslims seeking world Dominion, and Sharia.This is all hypothetical nonsense though, it won't happen.

America is NOT a stolen land. America is just like ALL other lands and peoples for THOUSANDS of years of human history, a history of CONQUEST. Stronger tribes have always fought, killed and taken the lands of others. The native Americans murdered, enslaved and stole the lands of other tribes. The same happened in Asia, Africa, Australia, Europe. Lol, the Romans conquered Britain, but you don't hear the British crying about that past and demanding compensation. Native Americans have no right to their own reservations. They lost and should grow up and stop using their past as a crutch, and using taxpayers money to compensate for their lack of success. They should be treated the same as every other citizen. What about all the homeless whites, blacks or hispanics?

The Comanche stole the land from the Tonkawa and Apache and the Aztecs stole it from the Mayans and from each other.  It's your logic son, I'm just smacking you in the face with it. If you want to argue that a civilization long in the iron \textbf{age} and fast approaching the industrial revolution was not superior to one stuck completely in the stone \textbf{age}, hundreds or perhaps even thousands of years from the Bronze \textbf{age}, you go right ahead but it's a ridiculous argument not worthy of further attention. Jesus Christ the civilizations you are trying to defend did not even have the wheel. 20,000 years in the New world and they had not yet discovered it. They had however discovered all manner of torture killing, slavery and human sacrifice, so there go's anything remotely resembling the moral high ground you want to claim. :)  So called "native" civilizations did the same and far worse to one another as what Europeans did to them. Europeans were just more advanced and better suited to sustained warfare and they won. Conquering so called "native" tribes through their own chosen method of conflict resolution - warfare, is certainly \textbf{nothing} to be ashamed of anymore than any of those "native" civilizations were ashamed of their prowess on the battlefield or what they did with their captives. I'm sure Comanche would have found your lofty moralistic assertions regarding war and conquest quite amusing as they impaled your hands and feet to the ground with stakes and slowly burned your limbs off in their fires for their amusement. They felt no shame over these activities, so why on earth would the Europeans and their descendants who conquered them feel any?

Next time you need to do something that involves a wheel, roller or some semblance there of, stop what you are doing and do what you need to get done without the technology in question then tell me how equal or superior it is. No driving. No using carts, wheel barrows, hand trucks, bicycles, whatever. You can't even wheel your trash can to the damn street. If you need to move it you get to drag it. You can use a horse to drag it for you if you've got one, although really this is iffy because the horse was brought from the \textbf{old} world and so called "native Americans" had never seen one pre-Columbian.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}1/165 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.606 \\  \hline

They didn't have the wheel because they had no concept of it's existence not because they discovered it and said: "Well shit, this thing is kinda neat but we don't have the horse yet so forget about it". Here's a little logic 101 for you: If you lack a draught animal to move heavy loads, or for that matter, any load, having the wheel is even more important because those loads are that much harder to drag across the freaking ground. I took my garbage can to the street the other night and was pretty happy it had wheels despite the fact that I didn't hook a horse to it. Try to think at least a little before you write this complete tripe ok?  We've had two major world wars so far and yet there has been no mass exodus back to the bush, sorry to tell you. Also, I think if such a mass exodus does occur, people will still be getting a lot of use out of the wheel so I wouldn't go putting all my money into stock in some company that's betting it all on bringing back the freaking travois if I were you. I also suspect that implements used for "bush craft" will continue to be made primarily of steel not stone.

By dragging them across the ground or by moving them on a conveyance using wheels or rollers? Or, by simply placing them on top of small round tree trunks and rolling the tree trunks along. Yeah, right, using wheels or rollers is hands down the better method with or without an animal to provide the power, which means you now feed said slaves that much less food to get whatever you are building built, plus it gets built faster so the slaves and any other labor can be put to work doing something else, like oh gee I don't know....FARMING, SO YOU CAN EAT.

The earliest written record of a stringed instrument, a lyre, was found in Mesopotamia (the Tigris and Euphrates rivers area) and dated to about 2,500-3,000 B.C..  The earliest single stringed instrument probably developed from the use of the bow and arrow, which was invented in Africa about 64,000 years ago.  The oldest flute found is made from animal bone.  It was found in Germany, but, again, the earliest flutes were probably made from hollow reeds, bamboo, etc., much earlier and far, far away from Germany.  Those type of plant materials tend to decompose quickly unless they are in an arid (dry) environment or there is no oxygen.  The Phoenician women were belly dancing in what is now Lebanon, I gather, at least 8,000 years ago.  It was introduced to Spain.  But when the Umayyad (Arabs) went to Spain, they had the singers and dancers sent to Damascus and Egypt to learn the newer Middle Eastern styles.  Before Columbus deary.  You have the internet.  It is very easy to learn about the \textbf{ethnic}, tribal, or religious dances of Tahitians, Hawaiians, Hindus, Zulu, Hopi, Aztec, Pedi, Samoans, Swedes, Zoastrians, Japanese, Tibetans, etc.  Fact check, but don't tell your people.  You might get hurt or stopped.   Porn?  Americans did not invent that either.  The Kama Sutra, which you would consider porn, was composed around 200 BC. It has drawings of 20 \textbf{sexual} positions and talks a lot about the theory of love and what triggers passion.  The earliest depictions of \textbf{sex} usually weren't portable because they were carved into or painted on stone, but there is a lot of it. Some even show men doing it with men.  When you men get horny, which is often, you will do it with darn near anything.   There is an ancient Egyptian papyrus that is over 8 feet long or depicting men and women doing the nasty deed.  Where paper was invented, East Asia, a lot of it has survived.  With the invention of the printing press in Germany, the doors were opened for mass production of drawings of porn and naked women.  Males are obsessed with \textbf{sex}.  And they, until recently, were almost always the ones to etch, carve, draw, paint, print, and/or film it.  And, millions of you around the world, including muslims, rape to do it.  I don't give a f  k, what the \textbf{Quran}, or any other sick idiotology, says.  Anytime a male forces that offending appendage into ANY young girl, \textbf{woman}, or boy, it should be cut off.  Slowly.  Especially in cultures where the victim risks being killed by their own family if they report it.  That is like killing a robbery victim for letting themselves be robbed.  Sick.   Since you were indoctrinated with lies from the moment you were born and can only repeat what you are trained to say (you would risk being severely punished if not killed if you did differently), I am perfectly happy that you won't ever come here.  From one personal experience with two beings of light, I, a \textbf{woman}, know that the greatest power and its minions probably don't have a chosen people here anymore.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small They've abandoned all traditions and identity, "become American", anyway, yet they want their land and reparations, k.America, as in USA, is a country made up of like 52 (something like that) states, all basically a country in a sense back in the day, truly massive.Native Americans never, ever had ideas of ownership of the land of the USA based on modern \textbf{nation} boundaries. You simply cannot say group X stole land from group Y, and then saying that the land group X has defined, as it's defined centuries after it was stolen in some cases, belongs to group Y. 99 of the land had \textbf{nobody} to steal it off - in so far as it pertains to natives anyway. Mexicans is a different story.We see this narrative continued in South Africa and Australia too - native tribe lands within the confines of modern nations conflated with whole modern nations created my pioneers on mostly unclaimed soil. Notice too how whites are never considered, whites have lost land too, or had someone else come and make a country, swallowing up yours. In many cases the white case is actually a more robust one. The Welsh (and some of the various Scottish and Irish peoples, to a lesser extent) have a stronger claim to England than American \textbf{Indian} natives do to the USA.It's ridiculous to say that natives of a few areas in the USA own a near continent sized country.I do think ancestral homelands/territories should be returned, and formerly nomadic groups should have considerations made for them. These natives wearing hoodies, using iPhones, with make-up on, we all know what side of the fence you stand on, you want to live with the descendants of settlers, just as they live, but you want social \textbf{b\textbf{rownie}} points and free shit. If people said, "Y'know what? Let's undo what we did to you guys. Here's your land, here's help, here's horses - as you were!" you'd reject it, thusly you have no argument.I feel sorry for the ones that lost their way, and know little of their people, but unless they do change, there is no discussion here.Couldn't they try to live traditionally in their reservations, or expand them by buying land, instead of just being a failure stuck near the bottom of the American system? Like, my guys you've gotta pick something, you can't have your cake and eat it. They don't even know what they are, what they need or why they want. They should mirror the alt-right, double down on tradition, reject the USA, vie for the repatriation of confirmed native lands, and such.I certainly don't think people have a bad view on natives - I thought they were cool till like two year ago when I realized they largely were culturally bereft losers who want the best of both worlds. I never got the impression other Americans didn't like them, understandably they they have some sort of victim complex and universal depression going on.Shame, as an ethno-nationalist I feel very sorry for them, hopefully one day we can all get along and live amongst our own kinds in our own land.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Brownie, Indian, Nation, Nobody & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Asian (South- India, Pakistan, Bangladesh), Ethnicity - Native-American, Nationality - General, Nationality - Hispanic & \cellcolor{green!5}5/531 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.942 \\  \hline

Según la circunstancia, intervendrán con brutalidad \textbf{tan} grave como los españoles y los primeros Unidos Estados gobiernos, hacia el americano aborígenes.En 1990 el pueblo de Oka, cerca de Montreal, decidía para aumentar el campo de golf de hoyos nueve a dieciocho en total. El campo de golf fue adyacente a las tierras de Kahnawa':ke de la nación de Mohawk. La invasión de la comunidad Mohawk no fue una infracción nueva pero una reducción continuó de su territorio que padecieron solo antes décadas durante la construcción de la cancha original. La disminución de las tierras comunidad Kahnawa':ke había estado unos siglos historias viejas que provocó los pueblos de la comunidad se armaron para conservar sus tierras restantes. Fueron de éxito con sus esfuerzos expulsar los ejércitos canadienses y el pueblo de Oka. Es conocido como la crisis Oka. En 2016 los miembros y hinchas del Standing Rock Sioux se unieron para parar la construcción del Oleoducto Acceso Dakota que fue yendo a través de la sagrada tierra tribal. Al primero, el punto muerto era éxito y había causado Barack Obama, el presidente EE.UU., para preguntar sobre una re evaluación por el Ejército Core de Ingenieros. Por desgracia, Donald Trump el presidente nuevo autorizó el oleoducto través de Standing Rock, más tarde.  La historia de Guatemala mucho tiene cuentos de la crueldad y autoridad poderosa de las plantaciones de los plátanos que impuso en la clase campesina y el pueblo maya. Fue la influencia autoritaria de las plantaciones de los plátanos que inició la guerra civil de Guatemala en 1956 cuando la compañía, United \textbf{Fruit}, había contratado el CIA de EE.UU. por el golpe de estado de Jacobo Arbenz. Arbenz iba a distribuir de nuevo la tierra sin cultivar a campesinas sin tierra. A esta tierra, United \textbf{Fruit} se había sentido privilegiado. Una vez iniciado, la violencia siguió pasando durante 36 años, las antagonistas fueron quemados en vivos y torturaron, terminando con las muertes de cientos de miles. Los cuentos de las delincuencias insoportables puedes encontrar en las literaturas de Rigaberta Menchú y la historia escrita del derrocamiento de Jacobo Arbenz. Todavía, los robos de tierras de las empresas fueron pasando en Guatemala. Aún, los robos de tierras desde las indígenas personas amenaza existencial a sus vidas y cultura. A menudo las hacen con muy poco violencia, sin embargo esta depende con la circunstancia y la cantidad de dinero. Si, el gol es para construir un campo de golf es posible que los beneficios sean no suficientemente bueno aceptar la publicidad mala de las noticias. No obstante, \textbf{tan} pronto como un oleoducto necesite un sagrado tierra de cementerios pasar por las personas de poder obtendrán los recursos naturales, incluso si la tortura necesita para convertirse en una tendencia.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Fruit, Tan & \cellcolor{green!5}Nationality - British, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality & \cellcolor{green!5}4/512 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.781 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small yer da.  So the English didn't fight and conquer the Scots????  I guess all those history books are wrong then.  The English took control over Scotland which was it's own separate country.  There was no battle of Sterling Bridge? No Colloden?  A "peaceful" move forward in Ulster? Sure, after the English had moved enough of their people over there and out numbered the Irish.  Those are just excuses, and you aren't applying the same metric to Ulster as you are to the U.S. or Canada.  So using YOUR metric, there are more whites here in North America than there are natives so case closed......you just painted yourself and your argument into a corner.  Oh, and I never mentioned "Braveheart" that is all you.  But I have picked up more than a few history books, you should try that sometime.....The bottom line is this.  The European settlers who came to North America took over, they conquered the native peoples.  Just like the Chippewa "moved" the Sioux out of the areas they were in and the Sioux "moved" the Kiowa and Shoshone out of the areas they were in.  And when I use the word "moved" I mean by force.  When native tribes saw lands they wanted, that another tribe was living on they didn't offer trades of goods for that land.  They took it.....they took it by force, at the points of spears, the tips of arrows and at the blades of knives.  Now, how much do you suppose the Chippewa compensate the Sioux today for the land they took???  Not a penny/pence....\textbf{nothing}.....  Oh, and before you or anyone else says, "the natives didn't have the concept of land ownership" I'll tell you you're only half right.  They didn't have the concept of PRIVATE land ownership.  But if you were a member of another tribe and found yourself on the wrong side of a river, valley or mountain, and got caught....you might not make it out alive.  Different tribes controlled different areas and they did so by force.  Your mistake is applying two distinctly different metrics to the same actions....one for natives and one for whites.

This Norman aristocracy installed itself as demagogues and have become billionaires who never have to work like the rest of us.  All they have to do is produce children.  The native Americans arrived in North America after the last ice \textbf{age}.  They found it empty because previous civilisations had been wiped out. Who knows who was there before them.  So, other people arrived before them and after them.  The fact that a group of people arrives somewhere "first" does not give them a right to own half the world while other people, elsewhere, are being oppressed and need to escape to somewhere else. There's no god given right for anyone to rope off land and stop humans from travelling on the planet like any other animal. It's all a human construction aimed at creating power structures within which some people get rich while the majority remain dirt poor.

The Europeans do this by sheer barbaric force. Sheer barbaric force.A European colony. A white boy leaves Europe, goes to somebody's land, takes it over, subjugates the people to his way of life: politically, economically, socially, culturally. That's a settler colony.My wife is from South Africa. South Africa is a settler colony. Europeans leave Europe, come to Africa, our continent and rip off the most wealthy part of the continent and take it. And subjugate our brothers and sisters to a vicious way of life.Mozambique is a settler colony. Angola is a European settler colony. Rhodesia. Rhodesia is a European settler colony. But we can use Rhodesia to understand one of the major characteristics of a European settler colony. The real name of Rhodesia is Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe is the real name.One of the characteristics of the European settler colony is that, when the European arrives, they change the name. They change the name. They change the name for two purposes. They want to oblivate the history of the past, number one, and, number two, they want to legitimize their existence as the true owners of the land. That's very important. Very, very important.And we must be very careful. We cannot allow them to do that to us because our ideology must be based on a correct interpretation of history. And if we must understand that we cannot allow the Europeans to define when we begin to study an area according to their definition, we will only begin to study areas when they arrive. Before they arrived \textbf{nothing} happened.Zimbabwe is the real name of Rhodesia. If you understood history, and you were studying history, you would see that we would study Zimbabwe. From the growth way back when our ancestors began to build a civilization. And we would understand Rhodesia as a barbaric interference to our way of life.Thus, when we study Zimbabwe, we would study Zimbabwe seeing it as a straight line and understanding that Europeans imposed themselves by force upon our civilization. But if we talk about Rhodesia, we start with Rhodesia. We start with some stupid man by the name of Cecil Rhodes who was a murderer and a thief. And that's where our history begins. Which is absolutely absurd.Australia is a European settler colony. Israel is a European settler colony.[applause] Israel is a European settler colony.Some people have been studying.Israel is a European settler colony because European Jews leave Europe, go to Palestine, take over the country, change the name to Israel, impose their culture, impose their political system, their economic system, their language, by sheer barbaric force, and oppress the original owners of the land.

They slaughtered tribes like the Ponca, the Oto, the Kiowa, the Pawnee, the \textbf{Crow}, the Omaha and several others. They conquered the Powder River Country from the \textbf{Crow} and forced many of them to flee to Canada, before the rebelling Lakota under Sitting Bull were themselves forced to flee to Canada by then-Col. Nelson Miles and the 5th Infantry, in revenge for Custer's death and the slaughtering of the 7th Cavalry at Little Big Horn.Then there was the Ute who were truly savages, who had actually established a slave trade by capturing Navajo and others from neighboring tribes and selling them as slaves to the Spanish and, later, to the Mexicans.The hardly ever had any treaties with one another, because hardly any of them spoke the same "native" language.The Indians waged wars and conquered others for their land and resources.

Many fought alongside the British during the American Revolution, and then allied with the British Empire again in Tecumseh's Confederacy, which was destroyed in the Battle of the Thames during the War of 1812.That's horrible how you could shrug off the raping and slaughtering of 650-800 civilians as "understandable anger."The truth is, that the US Reservation payments had arrived late, due to the US's economical priorities focused on suppressing the Secessionists' Rebellion in the south.The payments had arrived on the same exact day that a hunting team of Dakota warriors killed 5 civilians, burnt a farm and then, led by Little \textbf{Crow}, began burning settlements and raping and killing more civilians along the river bank.They then attacked Fort Ridgely, where 1,000 of them were driven off by 220 US soldiers.Then President Lincoln dispatched Col. Sibley to suppress the Dakota rebels, and out of the 498 who were captured, 303 were charged with multiple accounts of rape and murder, and were sentenced to death.Mr. Abraham Lincoln was the greatest Human being to ever walk the face of this country, perhaps even this continent. He took 3 days to examine each case individually, even during Robert E. Lee's Maryland Campaign in late 1862, and commuted 265 to prison and executed the remaining 38.President Lincoln granted this same benevolent mercy to the secessionist rebels in 1865, it doesn't mean their actions were justified.Andrew Jackson had sought to relocate the eastern tribes as to prevent the perpetuation of raids and conflicts. Some tribes like the Chocktaw, and even some Cherokee, did so willingly. Many other Cherokee among other tribes rebelled, and were forced.The Seminole also rebelled, and initiated the Second Seminole War, in which Andrew Jackson then launched his second invasion of Florida, his first being in response to Seminole raids in southern Georgia.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Crow, Indian & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - Native-American & \cellcolor{green!27}3/333 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.901 \\  \hline

It wasn't a lack of will, ruthlessness, or inability to wage war that cost so called native tribes (who were actually Asians) control of America, it was a lack of technology and lack of united front. They warred with each other as much or more than they did with the Europeans and they didn't even have the wheel much less the industrial capability to wage protracted warfare against an advanced and technologically sophisticated adversary.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Indian, Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - Native-American & \cellcolor{green!27}2/174 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.149 \\  \hline

They both are immigrants originated from Africa (probably Namibia). The so-called high class American tribes like Mayans and Aztecs have invaded, looted, raped, murdered and enslaved millions of lower class tribe members for thousands of years. They were so vicious that the lower caste Americans felt safer to live in European settlements with White Christians. The Christians did the same with Native Americans but it was not the main priority. So, it was not in a constructive way like the Mayans and Aztecs did which caused less damage. Besides, Christians didn't sacrifice and eat the flesh of lower caste Americans like the Aztecs and Mayans did. The White Europeans came to America not as invader but as saviour.

Stone \textbf{age} civilization is inferior to the iron \textbf{age} and industrial \textbf{age} and in fact even the bronze \textbf{age} civilizations, that's just the way it is. Arguments to the contrary are ridiculous. Technology advances and thus becomes superior to what it leaves behind. Christ the wheel didn't even exist in the new world until Europeans brought it here.

You tried to make the claim that technology in the New World failed to advance due to lack of competition when in reality competition for basic survival was fierce and persistent. That claim was rebutted and now you are going on about evil or lack thereof. What does that have to do with anything? There was no lack of competition in the pre-Columbian new world. Competition was constant and ongoing and technology still failed to advance to anything like what the \textbf{old} world did. New world inhabitants were quick to use European technology when they had access to it because it provided important advantages and those advantages were readily apparent to the Indians themselves, so all these various excuses for why Indians failed to advance beyond the stone \textbf{age} on their own fail. It was not because of lack of competition, it was not because of lack of draught animals with regard to the wheel and it was not due to any superiority of spoken language over written regarding lack of written languages.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}2/192 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.042 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small This is ridiculous. The fact that any of the former native empires still exist is a testament to the unique kindness and generosity of the United States in comparison with other nations and powers in history. If the United States was like any other \textbf{nation}, the native population and sovereignty would have been completely destroyed.  In almost all cases, when a powerful or more advanced \textbf{nation} comes to power the previous is destroyed and relegated to the pages of history. No, America is not built on stolen lands. It is built on conquered lands just like every other \textbf{nation} on the planet. The land that the neutral \textbf{nation} of Switzerland is built on used to be part of the Carthaginian homeland. Do we call it Carthage now? No, because the Carthaginian's fell from power and lost the land.  Native culture and American culture are different, end of story. The native cultures are built upon ideas that have no foundations in industry and commerce. Without industry it will be almost impossible for their economy and for their subsequent quality of life to improve. Generally speaking, native cultures tend to place more importance on leisure than they do on work. When the "white men" moved to the "new world" they found a culture that was (and in some ways still is) backwards and incapable of surviving in the modern world. The natives hadn't developed anything close to modern medicine, so when international commerce arrives carrying goods, ideas, ideas, ideas, etc. , the natives are completely unprepared. It hurts to say, but having a medicine man conduct a ceremony to heal someone of smallpox doesn't work. That's why 90 of the native population was killed by it as soon as international trade began to occur. Hell the native population hadn't even figured out the wheel when modern man arrived.If the "native" population want to have the benefits of American society they need to adopt the culture and ways of life of America. It's that simple. My ancestors had a poor quality of life in their home country (Germany, Norway, and Ireland) and wanted to fix it so they moved to the US gave up their \textbf{old} cultural traditions and adopted the American culture and tradition. The natives can do the same thing. No one is forcing them to stay on the reservation. They have to decide what is more important.

Tribes in Okla are well taking care of.. This is Cheyenne-Arapaho territory where I'm at and majority of the ppl don't have to work. They all have new cars or newish car, housing is either very cheap or given to them if qualified through a special tribal program. And they receive per-cap checks 4 times a year. Checks average around \$2-\$3,000. Reservations are ran by the tribe themselves. They are a \textbf{Nation} within a \textbf{nation}.

That said, there is a dark underbelly to everything in life---people, nations, corporations, charities etc etc. The best thing we can do is to work hard to make this a world worth living in. No one denies the plight of Native Americans and the brutal means used against them. Context does matter though. Long before the white man stepped foot in North America the \textbf{Indian} tribes were warring with one another, murdering one another, raping women from opposing tribes and stealing each others land. In other words, they were guilty of the same atrocities you accuse the white settlers of doing. To say that it is wrong is an understatement---but both cultures engaged in the same bad behavior. After Jamestown and Plymouth, the Natives still were intent on wiping each other out regardless of the presence of whites. Yes the English settlers could be savage but it is pure fantasy to think that North America was going to sit unmolested forever. A technologically superior power was going to arrive at one point or another. What happened was inevitable but that doesnt mean it was right. The truth is that human history is a  history of conquest, subjugation, conquering, victory, defeat and re-conquering. This has been true since the earliest civilizations. The Greeks conquered the Persians, the Roman's conquered the known world. From Alexander the Great to Ghengis Khan to Napoleon---territory and nations have been conquered and fought over with millions dying along the way. Sad but that's just the truth of human history. If every people dwelled on the fact that their ancestors were conquered and brutalized every culture on earth would have reason to hold a grudge. That kind of hate however only fuels more hate. Americans recognize the injustices done to blacks and Natives and steps have been taken to address the lingering issues. We can't live in the past forever however if we are to have a future. This applies to both individuals and nations. We must move beyond resentment to healing and unity if we are to achieve harmony.

Today, Native population at 15 million, while European population ( in continents of America + Europe) at one Billion. History is written by the victors. Remember the well-known story told was that the indigenous Native people of America continents, who had no prior contact with White Europeans, were wiped out by diseases brought up by European newcomers when they first came over and occupied the land. Here's the analysis. How come another Indigenous \textbf{African} slaves that were brought over from remote West Africa, deepest part of Africa, who also had no prior contact with White Europeans,  were not wiped out by diseases? The other story told was 'Cowboys and Indians'. The story goes like that native Indians were slaughtered by Cowboys. But what really happened to indigenous Native Americans, so-called Indians, and the real life story was further from the truth. In reality, they were slaughtered not only by cowboys, but most by settlers, civilian militias, military, and all are backed by general populace, the country and the government, as a whole, since every groups had \textbf{nothing} to lose but more to gain. The plain truth, of course, is that the indigenous native Americans were all slaughtered in order to get their land, plain and simple!

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I don't like the way the American Indians have been treated throughout history.  But I am tired of hearing about how American Indians are the only true peoples of this country and how this entire country was stolen from them.  First of all, \textbf{nobody} was native to what is now the U.S..The fact is that \textbf{NOBODY}  is an American native unless you are a wild animal.  These people came across the land bridge and settled here.  This makes them first to settle here but it does not make them native to this land.  Just because someone got here first does not make them the original or native people of any land.  They crossed the land bridge, Europeans sailed across the Atlantic and it appears now that the Vikings may have been here way before anyone even knew that Europeans were  here or in Canada. The reason the American Indians never considered land something they owned may be because when they crossed the land bridge they may have considered this as land belonging to someone else and they were initially just passing through and needed to care for their own people.  Why so many European Americans love to be self haters is amazing.  They built the greatest country in the world and don't need to be apologetic about that.  Yes, they treated other people very badly and that is a fact.  Modern Americans had \textbf{nothing} to do with that and need to stop making apologies for what their ancestors did.  Modern Americans had \textbf{nothing} to do with that and in fact, they owe no one anything at all,  My family didn't even arrive here until the early 20th. century and they lived like animals initially.  They worked hard and made something of themselves.  They didn't get any handouts or hand ups or whatever you want to call it nowadays.  They learned the language and assimilated and worked hard.  If people do the same thing, they will be successful anywhere they go.  I greatly admire and respect the American Indians and find their culture completely amazing and wholesome.  Let's not forget that their women and children were killed by European Americans and let's also not forget that they did the same and many times worse to European Americans as well.  It doesn't matter who started it. what matters is that it happened at all.  Everyone needs to stop living in the past.  We need to put these things behind us and move forward.......together.  I am confident that we are more than ready to do that now.  Good luck to us and God Bless us all.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nobody, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}4/434 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.922 \\  \hline

I look at the Reservation and see that's what America would have looked like if \textbf{Indian}'s had taken over.  \textbf{Indian}'s and Mexican's could have gone to school, college, trade schools and become leaders instead of follower's (of their ancestors kind of thinking, speaking and acting).  Every district, town, county, state, country has its do-\textbf{nothing}  blamers, whiners and excuses for leading their lives into holes instead of getting off their lazy, 'poor me' butts.  I don't feel sorrow for the weak-minded, I feel pity because I know they are just as talented as any other human being in the world.  ANYONE living in  poverty of thought, word or deed DOES NOT PRAY, DOES NOT LIVE FOR GOD ALONE, DOES NOT OBEY, SERVE, KNOW, LOVE, AND WORSHIP GOD.  And that's where to begin with change.  Forget about getting your land back, that's NOT what your life is about.  We each MUST change ourselves from within FIRST before we stupidly think we're going to change other's.  This land, this earth, belongs to ALL of us!  These people in the vid are focusing on a speck in the corner of a painting instead of seeing the whole canvas.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Indian, Nothing, alcohol & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Behavioural Addiction - Alcohol, Ethnicity - Native-American & \cellcolor{green!27}3/453 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.662 \\  \hline

What's taught in public schools is that Native Americans were peace-loving doves living in harmony with nature.  Even Russel Means said that Amerindian warfare was more like glorified football games.  The facts that I've laid out aren't taught in public schools."Our history tells, all the tribes you just typed about, as nomadic peoples who followed the buffalo."  You're telling less than half the history.  They were nomadic, and also warlike.  They followed buffalo on horses that came from Europeans and used guns and steel."The Lakota \textbf{nation}, along with our enemies, had respect for all nations who wanted to live and protect their own ways of life."  This is another falsehood.  If the Lakota's enemies respected them so much, how pray-tell were there no shortage of \textbf{Crow} and Pawnee scouts in the U.S. Army?  The fact of the matter is Native Americans identified themselves by their respective tribe first over a collective.  Tribes that stood in other tribe's way had three choices:  fight and die, be forcibly assimilated, or be pushed to marginal lands.  All three happened.  They seldom bothered to engage in diplomacy and never set aside land for each other."White colonizers brought evil and spread lies every time they spoke, which still holds true to this very day."

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Aguvika  You'll need to come up with a better analogy since your statement is rife with many logical fallacies.  I'll address five of them.  First, China is a country, not a continent.  Historically, there was no single \textbf{nation} from Europe that colonized the entire Western Hemisphere.  Australia notwithstanding, I'm not aware of a single \textbf{nation}-state colonizing or "invading" an entire continent.Second, contrary to what revisionist history has taught you, the Native Americans didn't claim (let alone occupy) every single square-inch of land in the Western Hemisphere.  There was plenty of land that was not claimed or occupied and that's where Europeans initially went.  Jamestown, Plymouth Rock, Manhattan Island were not stolen.Third, what you're basically saying is that was okay for Native Americans to invade each other lands, and then turn around and cry because they were beaten at their own game.  Yeah...  that's quite a double standard.  Also keep in mind that Native Americans didn't exactly try to engage in diplomacy or set aside land for each other in order to avoid conflict.Fourth, speaking of world wars, are you not aware that Asia was involved in both world wars as well?  Both world wars weren't just between Europeans--hence the term "world" wars.  China fought in the second world war against Japan.  You really need to brush up on your history.  This is probably the most egregious fallacy you've got.Five, with regards to both the Sioux and the United States in particular, you do realize that the U.S. Army had no shortage of \textbf{Crow} and Pawnee scouts, right?  Those tribes hated the Sioux.  Here's a reality check.  Native Americans had just as much of a hand in helping create the United States (and Canada too) as they did in fighting against it.As a bonus, China is currently colonizing Africa.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Crow, Nation & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/303 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.66 \\  \hline

Need I bring up the Aztecs with their daily human sacrifice?"Why will we fight[?] we didn[']t believe in land ownership[.]"  Yet another falsehood.  The difference between the two respective cultures is that Native Americans understood land ownership as synonymous with occupation, while Europeans practiced political control over land when they didn't occupy it."No jails....No police...No courts..."  That's right.  Weaker Native American  tribes fighting against stronger tribes had three choices in the face of tribal conquest:  fight and die, be forcibly assimilated, or be pushed to more marginal lands."We fought each other is lies to cover up the genocide of my people 100 MILLION in TURTLE ISLAND"  Two points.

Also, based on your comment, I think it would do you some good to read books."We were. once 500 millions Natives here in all TURTLE ISLAND"  Please back that up with scholarly evidence.  Even Ward Churchill's estimates of the pre-contact population are not that high.  By the way, Churchill was fired from his job as a university professor for falsifying history (and his lineage--turns out he's a fake \textbf{Indian})."Fucken Cowards the Whiteman couldn't beat us in battle so what they do next bring diseases and killing over 100 million of my people....My people didn't know what hit them.........and with 10 of my people left we still fought to the end the European Invaders......"  Wait...  Not only are your figures insanely inflated to the point of mythology, but your math is way off.  (Which leads me to assume you're being comical.)  You say that there were originally five-hundred million natives of which one-hundred million died from disease.  Okay...  That leaves four-hundred million left, not ten percent...  Where's the genocide again?  The experts that have studied the virgin soil epidemic have concluded that infectious disease wiped out about seventy-five to ninety percent of the native population.  You're argument continues to conflict with itself:  in one instance you're saying that one-quarter succumbed to disease; in another you're saying that only ten percent "fought to the end"."and still toke the Whiteman 300 more years to conquered us"  Technically that depends on which tribes and respective European nations fought.  Some tribes didn't last long against Europeans; others, lasted for quite some time, but not three-hundred years.  Also given the context, most of the conquest in the U.S. and Canada was achieved through a fountain pen, not bullets and disease.  That's why there's reservations instead of mounds of dirt.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Indian & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Native-American & \cellcolor{green!27}1/355 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.282 \\  \hline

Even if you are being serious, I can't help but laugh at your replies."No wait USA history Christopher Columbus discover America"  Christopher Columbus didn't found the U.S.A.  He discovered the continent it was founded on nearly three hundred years earlier."right now there's 350 million USA citizens in only 525 years.....We been here over 60,000 years in TURTLE ISLAND"Where to begin.  First, this is not scholarly evidence.  There's no way the Amerindian population was over five-hundred million like you claimed since the population in Europe in the sixteenth century was about seventy million at most.  There's no way Amerindian standards of living could have supported that many people.  Second, the United States hasn't been a country for five-hundred and twenty-five years genius.  It was founded in 1776.  Please take a history class."We Native know our History well"  Sure...  You're about as "native" as Ward Churchill and Johnny Depp are."The Whiteman is the devil......you steal....rape....and kill......all the killing....slavery...."That's quite the \textbf{racist} sentiment.

That's not to say that there was anything inherently bad about Native people because it's something you find all over the planet.  The problem is how people like you fetishize Natives.

And the fights that broke out were \textbf{nothing} like the savages that came over and tried to wipe out an entire population. They didn't massacre people who didn't have a way to fight back just because they could, unlike the many acounts of written history that states how native women and children were murdered violently, by colonists. They did not "own" the land because they were not stupid enough to stay in one spot and use up all of the resources. So yes they were better custodians because they knew how to farm and how to make entire species go extinct because they how to value the earth. Also, there were slaved but do not think of it as you are because Natives were \textbf{nothing} like Europeans and did not have that kind of brutal mindset to treat people the way they did. After capturing slaves they were actually given a tribal members rights. Cannabilism was not a practice.

The Sheepeaters and Anasazi are two victims of genocide that immediately come to mind.  We've got coprolites showing the Anasazi were eaten after they were murdered.  The Maya, Inca, and Aztec were all supported by a vast network of conquered and enslaved people.  The Aztecs in particular required tributes of live people, including children (one of their deities in particular 'needed the tears of children'), for especially gruesome and torturous human sacrifice.  All three also destroyed much of the natural environment they lived in.  The Hopewell culture required human sacrifice as part of their burial rituals.There were very peaceful groups like the Hopi, but the claim that Natives were all a bunch of nice pre-Columbian hippies before evil Europeans showed up is delusional.

No because the Average Christian amd Muslim is no Slave owner, so stop treating them like a Monolith, that's \textbf{dumb} and shows you lack of intelligence.Yes, because they were pressured to do so by the European Empires, who manipulated them into fighting against each other and not allowing them to develop without slavery, because slavery will exist as long as someone demands for it, from which the Western powers got thr most from it.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Brenda Upchurch I seen your comments a few times. You seem bitter. No you're not forcing it down our throats and I agree about taking personal responsibly. But there's a such a thing of cultural trauma. When anyone of any \textbf{race} goes through trauma events it does leave you with not so great feelings and \textbf{alcohol} just happens to be a easily accessible anti depressant. We can't exactly handle \textbf{alcohol} as well as the people who introduced it to us. As you might obviously know now I'm Native. I grew up in alcoholic household and outside of my house was an alcoholic community. I always told myself I wouldn't drink as a kid but I do but with the exception of not drinking as much as other people I know. I'm aware of what happened to my people in the past, I'm aware of the traumatic events that happened to me growing up and that its \textbf{common} among native people that dealt with similar things as me so I understand that most of us are in pain from what happened to us in the past. \textbf{Mental} health takes a lot of effort and time to be healthy most people just want happiness and it comes quickly with a bottle but its short lived and destructive. I'm doing my best to be healthy cause I want to know what its like to be healthy. It will take sometime to heal but it will happen and we're going to have our cultural back completely, I faith we will. Bitterness and hate wont do anything but promote the things you're complaining about and keep us divided and exactly where we are. When people drink, do drugs and act I suppose like children I don't think their bad  people. With animals as well act aggressive when in pain or when their back into a corner.

Look at your children shooting up schools... they lack a connection and respect for their own people. There are many European cultures... but many white Americans mixed so much with various \textbf{ethnic} groups they lost connection to culture. Which is very sad. At least Aboriginal peoples have their culture and connection to their people... so you don't see them going \textbf{crazy} mass murdering each other.Americans tried to replace culture with capitalistic corporatism... and trying to replace \textbf{ethnicity} with merely skin shade of "white".... it is very unhealthy for any people to be stripped from their culture and \textbf{ethnicity} in this way. It is white washing them in a cruel, inhumane way and expecting them to be fine with it as long as you have lots of pharmaceuticals to numb them to the pain of living. Your only response to this is a smug "why be proud of something someone else did"... your own people are suffering, disconnected, drugged up on pharmaceuticals, \textbf{obese} and dying as a result of the loss of culture and loss of connection to their people and ancestors... leaving their lives in the hands of corporations... it's not a good place to be.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Crazy, Ethnic, Ethnicity, Obese & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments, Physical Identity - Physical Features & \cellcolor{green!27}5/220 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.273 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I'm not American, firstly, I am European. I think you misunderstand what I mean - I don't think people should be proud of what their ancestors did, or blame themselves for it. I think they should judge their society on how it stands. I do not think that we should reject culture, I just don't think we should judge ourselves on what somebody did 300 years ago, and that we should judge ourselves on what we are now. My point is that if we claim a historical figure as our own and say we are all the better for it, we lose sight of what we may have become, and we also separate ourselves from other cultures. I am not calling for the annihilation of cultures, but isolationism and extreme patriotism can only lead to \textbf{racism}, hatred, \textbf{xenophobia}, and, eventually, war and genocide. The Holocaust happened because of a separation of cultures over several hundred years leading some to thinking that one was inherently "different" from the other, and lesser. WWI happened because of the cumulation of the \textbf{nationalism} of the European empires. The genocide of the Aboriginals happened because their culture was seen as different. The Ugandan Genocide is another example, as is the slave trade and the subjugation of India. We must not see ourselves as the ideals and actions of one person in the past, because that person had faults, and because that person is not in fact us. Our actions are what should make us, not those of history, and in accepting this, we bring love and acceptance to the world where there could have been hatred and genocide.

Look at any Mexican today they look little to \textbf{nothing} like the Native Americans you seen before they were "colonized by white people". They were literally orientals with dark skin. Almost all of Mexicans today look Middle Eastern. There was a Mexican educator who tested his genealogy and found he was Jewish. He did this for some 60 other people and found they were all Jewish even though they claimed "pure" Native American heritage. So yes, if Mexico was "conquered by the evil whites" as our "History texts" so claim wouldn't all Mexicans today be blonde haired with blue eyes like the Norwegians are?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small These kind of videos are terrible, they are not promoting accurate information. We need to start by discussing things with honesty, the truth isn't always the story people like, but, it's the truth non the less. The factual truth is, there is NOT an indigenous human to North America, ALL humans migrated from another continent and the only argument is who and when first. It is true that the Asian Pacific immigrants that we refer to today as Indians were here when Christopher Columbus arrived. It's true that the Europeans (and others) took control of this continent from those Asian Pacific immigrants some time after they arrived to North America. The other point that is commonly left out of this debate is the fact that there was not a single national government in place for the Asian Pacific immigrants that defined the laws and borders of a sovereign \textbf{nation}. North America had a fragmented series of Asian Pacific immigrants, that formed tribes and basically occupied, not controlled parts of it.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Before america it wasnt a unified country. Yes, there were massacres and violence on both sides and yes the british ancestors were involved from colonisation. But before they came, the native americans are known to have fought among themselves and slaughtered other tribes; much larger percentages of males were killed in those times than compared to Europe or USA today. See this graph:  [LINK]  So instead of feeling sorry for yourselves and hating the country that was unified with a constitution that protects everyones rights equally and is one of the best places on earth to live, grow up and make something of yourselves. you are poor in america if you choose to be. you can succeed if you put the graft in. If you choose to live that way then thats your choice. Creating a victim culture will only keep you down; you're doing that on your own. But you complain about america being stolen lands when in centuries past it was just your local territory, whilst facing death from disease and potential war with other tribes who would in turn, steal their lands and resources. You complain about it being stolen when you "steal" the very benefits and technologies and protection that america has created. You live in houses not teepees, you drive cars, you have a guitar, you wear western clothes etc and you spit on it and weep because you can in that country without fear of prosecution. So many of you isolate yourselves from the rest and what do you think that fosters other than suspicion and division. Most americans dont wish any ill will towards you and almsot none of them have committed violence against you. And yet you keep on saying that it was taken from you, your way of life. Well, as far as i can tell from this video, your way of life looks like ours. You enjoy the same comforts. I dont see any homemade clothes from animals, I dont see loads of horses, i dont see totem poles (depending where in america you are ofc) etc. If this was a video showing your way of life, surely you would proudly show that? Instead Im seeing a pretty western display. Not even a religious ritual. Seems a little hypocritical to me. Let's talk about the claimed genocide. Genocide would be wiping out the whole or part of the population regardless of \textbf{gender} or \textbf{age}. But the female native american mitochondrial DNA was kept intact ie they werent massacred. If only 1 in 454 native american women married a european, that would account for the entire Native american population decline. You dont think that didnt happen? I wont deny the atrocities commited however. Forced marriages, rape and massacres of women and children. But atrocities were committed on both sides. It is said that \textbf{nothing} compares to the comanche tribe in terms of sheer barbaric, immoral behavior. Not to mention the Apache tribe. They did unspeakable things, often far worse than european examples of brutality because it was the way of life whilst europeans already had a moral code for warfare and standards they were expected to abide by. Of course, many did not and committed awful crimes. I'm just saying, if you think the native americans were all innocent here, you are profoundly mistaken. Today it seems you practice those rituals, celebrations, customs etc as a sort of carnival or something to make sure it is remembered and celebrated as a relic of the past. It doesnt seem to be an integral way of life. And you keep your children isolated and tell them the "outsiders" as you so kindly call them, took everything from you whilst enjoying everything those same "outsiders" have to offer. They live in bitter resentment, suspicion and wistfulness. It doesnt surprise me that the suicide rate is so high. It is as much the fault of the americans as your own. You are from siberia, and there is evidence to suggest that you killed off the natives that lived there before. But that is still a theory.

The native Americans were too busy killing each other to build such a great country.5) If you think "white people" have done some bad things, go take a look at what the Africans, Arabs, Asians have been doing for the past thousand years.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Arabs didn't impose themselves on North Africans. Historically speaking the only battle they had with berbers was in SouthernTunisia/Ifriqiya. They were halted 5 times by berbers more specifically the Riffians from expanding into Spain so the Arabs (Ummayads) clearly never exerted much power over them since berbers were independent. The only reason the berber revolt happened is because the Ummayads promised the berbers alot of land but instead gave them the ones right next to the Christian ones that were more contested/even deployed them to garrison in unsafe places. Even till the 12th century Ibn Khaldun mentioned in the Muqaddimah that the Arab language was "submerged" under the Arab one, how could this be if the Arabs really were conquerors?  Apart from the Banu Maaqil, Banu guil etc. who settled very early in North Africa but integrated others came forcefully due to berber dynasties most notably the Almohads who incentivezed them with money. The Almohads brought in Arab tribes to garrison troublesome places in Morocco where berber tribes were not loyal example Douakkala region where the Almohad king brought an Arab tribe and replace the native berber ones and bear in mind the Almohads were Berbers themselves. The Arabs hated this job so much so many wanted to go back forcing the Almohad king to fight them in a battle just to keep them in Morocco. As for Arabization, it's a fairly new phenomenon and has been brought about because governments are trying to homogenize their nations demographically something that only came about after our colonization by the French since in 20th century Europe \textbf{nation} states based on similar demographics were becoming the norm. Centuries ago Berbers and Arabs never gave a fuck about their differences but only on how competent their ruler was why do you think the berbers did not mind pledgin allegiance to an Arab man (Moulay Ismail) It's because they saw he was competent than the previous dynasty due to him pacifying Morocco.Now tell me did the Natives pay Americans to come? Did the native American language dominate the English one during the new colonies? Did the Native Americans pledge allegiance willfully to American rule?Inter \textbf{Ethnic} relationship between Arabs and Berbers has historically been fairly good over a period of 1300 years but that of Native Americans and Europeans have been pretty shit over a period of just 300 years.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnic, Nation & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}2/396 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.505 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Pockets 1980 I find it even more hilarious that you don't realize Native Americans existed and still exist to this day in South America. Haven't you heard of the Inca Empire? The Incas were freaking Native Americans! Just because they were from South America doesn't mean they weren't Native Americans. In fact, "Native American" is defined as any of the first/original inhabitants of the AMERICAS prior to European settlement. However, "Native American" is the most familiar term in the USA to describe indigenous people of the Americas.I don't take credit for inventions/innovations/developments from other races and cultures either. You clearly do, however. Mind you that credit only goes to the individual(s) who contributed to the inventions/innovations/developments, NOT entire cultures and races. It's certainly most reasonable, considering the vast majority of folks within an entire culture/\textbf{race} do \textbf{nothing} to establish such products. In other words, you and the majority of racists claim such products by *association*; as far as I'm concern you and the vast majority of White folks didn't invent or even innovate jack and even if you did (which I highly doubt), it must be of little to no significance to general society. So, obviously being of a particular races doesn't mean you'll be inherently more innovative. I also find it pitiful you White supremacist/racist base much of your agenda based upon associating yourselves with a handful of "far-from-your-average" White folks' inventions/innovation. But please, continue with your heavily flawed, unpopular agenda and ramblings.BTW, you clearly fail to realize I'm not descended from Native Americans from the US.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Todays Cherokee should be ashamed of themselves too.    Like E.Warren, they lie about their heritage. With an agenda created by globalists like E. Warren, to propagate the hate-whitie agenda.    I am a card carrying Cherokee who knows who my father's were.    My people killed the whites without cause within days of their arrival at what became the Jamestown colony, and they did it without provocation.    After they settled on land that we did not use, we learned that they would pay us to live on lands that we did not use, and after they paid us money to settle that land, for profit we killed them because we became under the employ of the British. French, and Spanish.   We learned from the British, who told us to claim all land belongs to us. even if we do not live on it or use it, because the colonists would not give the British what they demanded.When the colonists came, we had many gods, and they taught us about Jesus Christ.    They gave us the idea to create a written language, and part Cherokee-whites, who learned English from the Christian white colonists, translated the bible into Cherokee so all my people could know Jesus Christ.    Before the colonists came, we relied on the Buffalo and other game for all of our clothing, tee-pees and flooring, and we were depleting our land of the buffalo.    After they arrived, they taught how to grow cotton and other plants that could be used to make cloth, and they even taught us how to make spinning wheels to spin the cottons and plants and then weave them into cloth.   And my people made beautiful dresses for themselves like the white women wore, and our men wore pants and nice shirts like the white colonist men did.   Before the white colonists arrived, my people did not know how to smoke the buffalo meat, and  we relied heavily on the hides for everything.   We only ate what we could eat at the moment, and since we did not know how to smoke the meat, we left the majority of the carcass behind to rot.   And the buffalo became hard for us to find because we were so dependent upon them.   The white colonist brought their domestic livestock with them, and they taught us how to raise beef, pork, and chicken.    They taught us to milk the cows and to make butter, cheese, and other dairy products. Then all we did is lie about them because of a globalist agenda, claiming that they were depleting our land, when we were the ones who were completely dependent of the buffalo and on the colonists for trade.  The white colonists taught us to build huge plantation homes for ourselves out of wood, and to cultivate the land for our own plantations.    Then we no longer relied on the buffalo to make out tee-pees and to lay the hides out for flooring.    We stole \textbf{black} slaves and worked them on our plantations, and we did not have indentured servants like the Christian white colonists did.   We burned their women and children alive, and the white colonists did not retaliate by burning our women and children alive, but instead they fought our warriors like men.There were many white colonists who fought for us in Washington DC, and we were betrayed by our own Cherokee people, Ridge-Wattie group, who sold us off our land for a few pieces of gold and silver.    There is much more that I could write but this enough to set the record straight.   Many of the Cherokee father's would be ashamed of their descendants for their involvement in the globalist propaganda about the true history of my people.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!5}1/621 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.161 \\  \hline

Rome was a bit better in incorporating conquered peoples. Perhaps Native Americans should be fed to lions?  Or, perhaps we should burn their reservations to the ground because they impinge on weekend happy hunting grounds called golf courses---a modeling of the American \textbf{Indian} method.

More likely, the word derives from Colombus' description of the people he found here. He was an Italian that spoke very poor Spanish, and in his written accounts he called the Indians "Una gente in Dios," or "A people in God." In god, in Dios, Indians. It's a perfectly noble thing. I simply can't justify this awkward phrase "Native Americans." First of all, they're not Natives. They came here from Asia over the Bering Land Bridge. In fact, there are no natives anywhere, in the world. Everyone is from somewhere else. All people are refugees, immigrants, or aliens. If there are natives anywhere, it would have to be people still living in the great valley in Africa. So everyone is just visiting. So much for native. As far as calling them Americans is concerned, well... how can I say this? We steal their hemisphere, destroy 500 cultures, kill 20 million, stick the rest of them on the worst land we can find, and then as a special bonus, we name them after ourselves. It's embarrassing.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Ricky Torres So all the problems started just two years ago? For one thing All countries have boarder laws and Trump is just enforcing what is already on the books. MS13 is raising hell in forty cities and law biding people are sick of it. I am a registered independent, been that way from the start. I didn't vote for Trump, but things have changed. My brother in law and his family is from Peru, they are legal residence . My brother in law and his sisters were born here and his parents followed the law and became citizens. It is not far to them and the million people that we here legally each year to have mods just force there way into a country. If they are going to brake the law to get here, they will brake the law ones they are here. A boarder wall armed with military would help. Along with severe penalties for business owns that employ illegals, and absolutely no welfare to not legal residence. Being in this country without the government knowing your here is a felony and all felons should be delt with accordingly. As far as politics, as an independent I voted for people of both parties. I often voted democrat, however the Democratic party has changed. They are pushing for socialism, no way in hell will I live under Socialist control. Then they formed and endorsed Antifa. No way is a masked mob going to intimidate me. Democrats what everyone to think they are a victim and we should blame others for everything. No way. Now I find out because I no longer support the Democratic agenda I am now a \textbf{racist} and a bigot. Now people are speaking out against liberal nut cases I find my first amendment rights are under attack. It's funny they say it's only about Trump but ten years ago Democrats in my state started loosing power and that is when alot of this weaponized slander started. Now all but one Democrat is gone they have resorted to all out violence. You say it's only about Trump bit Trump was not even in politics when this shit started.

Have you ever heard about the "Babylonian captivity"? or the "Babylonian Exile?".The Native Jews of Judea and Kingdom of Israel were exiled by the Babylonian Empire. and Most of them were exiled. but it is not the end did you know there are Jews from Israel whose families and whose generations lived before the \textbf{age} of British Palestine Mandate ?My Jewish grandpa's grandpa lived in Israel. In Jerusalem. at 1856.did you know there are plenty of Archaeology Proofs which prove that the Jewish People had lived on the area of Israel and Jerusalem more than 2000 years ago?Just google it.  because people like you won't believe me anyway.May god bless you.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General & \cellcolor{green!27}1/150 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.667 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I guess I should start my reply with some positives, then go downhill from there.    I have visited maybe half a dozen \textbf{Indian} reservations to include Mescalero Apache in Ruidoso, NM; Taos Pueblo, Navajo in north NM; The Fort Sill \textbf{Indian} School; and our only Texas \textbf{Indian} reservation.  I missed the Pine Ridge.  At none of the ones I visited did I see any Indians falling around in a drunken or drugged stupor as depicted in videos like the one shown above.  Do they keep these types at Pine Ridge?  The Indians I saw were friendly, not accusatory, apparently employed and well dispositioned.  Some respondents have called me ignorant.  The fact that I have visited these reservations and sites along with a partial list of the books about or concerning American Indians I would have to agree to disagree with them.While at the Little Big Horn my wife and I ate at the store down the hill and to the north of Custer Hill.  I did notice some posters warning the local \textbf{Indian} youth of the dangers of drug abuse.  Some have asked me where I get my data on crime and the American \textbf{Indian}.  I get them from government data.  Despite what I have observed the overall news is grim.  I copied the below from the Bureau of Justice Stats:American Indians And Crime: A BJS Statistical Profile, 1992-20December 1, 2004    NCJ 203097Summarizes data on American Indians in the criminal justice system and reports the rates and characteristics of violent crimes experienced by American Indians. This report updates a previous BJS report, American Indians and Crime, published in 1999. The findings include the involvement of \textbf{alcohol}, drugs, and weapons in violence against Indians. The report describes victim-offender relationships, the \textbf{race} of those involved in violence against Indians, and the rate of reporting to police by victims. It discusses the rates of arrest, suspect investigations and charges filed, and incarceration of Indians for violent crimes.Highlights: From 1976 to 2001 an estimated 3,738 American Indians were murdered. Among American Indians \textbf{age} 25 to 34, the rate of violent crime victimizations was more than 2½ times the rate for all persons the same \textbf{age}. Rates of violent victimization for both males and females were higher for American Indians than for all races.Part of the American Indians and Crime SeriesI was particularly troubled by the 3,738 Indians murdered, most by other Indians.  This is seriously more than the estimated Indians killed at Horse Shoe Bend (857), Sand Creek (150), Washita (75), Little Big Horn (146), and Wounded Knee (150) combined.  Also mentioned was that this victimization rate was 2 and ½ times that of the general population.  Most of this was \textbf{Indian} on \textbf{Indian}.  If the reports of 'white genocide of the Indians' were true, just how is it that the 'murderous, psychopathic, butchering, mass murdering' whites of the 19th century turn into the angelic creatures of the contemporary \textbf{age}?  And what made the Indians so violent toward each other?

I lived in Nova Scotia and we couldn't just go out and set traps without permits or even hunt. yet if you have a special native victim card you can hunt all year around. tell me which one has a bigger effect to the ecosystem? hunt during hunting season or hunt all year around? stop blaming everything on the white men when 2/3 of them didn't come to North America on their free will. maybe look at European history to get a better perspective on the matter. we had been fucked and slaughtered by our own so called leaders and religious nuts for thousands of years. do you hear us complaining? no, we move on and try to make it better instead of living off of welfare and getting drunk and complain about the shithole you are on. get a job buy a house raise a family. you can buy property so start working and buying some back.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Black & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!27}1/294 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.34 \\  \hline

Check Ptolemy's map. Much of North Africa and Asia Minor were considered part of Europe until well into the Middle Ages, as the difference between Europe and Asia was very much a gray area. Even today, no two cartographers exactly agree on continental boundaries; by most definitions, Kazakhstan is technically partially in Europe, but no one considers it a European country.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The white man should be ashamed?  So should \textbf{black} Africans who sold their own people into slavery.   There was no welcome wagon for the Colonialists.  The  different tribes fought one another often.  Many Indians befriended the white  people and would help them track  other Indians down.  Not much loyalty there.   It was not the white man's intention to come here and hurt anyone.  However, we are talking about the same people involved in \textbf{witch} hunts.  They would stone them to death or set them on fire.   The Indians were just as savage and cruel as  the white settlers.  I don't necessarily agree with the methods used.  However, I'm Shawnee and Osage.  That great heritage lives inside me and most of my ancestors.  I'm also Irish and Scottish.  The Indians fought a really good fight.  They were simply outnumbered.  Some fought until the bitter end.  I wouldn't have expected any less.  One thing my ancestors couldn't do was turn them into slaves.  Some became slaves.  Some white and \textbf{black} people were enslaved by the Indians.  Then they were placed on reservations.  The simple truth is that the Indians were never truly able to recover.  One thing is for sure:  without the settlers and puritans, the evolvement of the white \textbf{race} would have been much slower.  Everyone today, benefits from the white \textbf{race} and their contributions to the world.  Their blood runs through my veins.  Without a doubt.   Unlike my great grandmother, I'm not ashamed to be a part of that \textbf{race} of people.  They would lie and say they weren't \textbf{Indian}.  They were treated horribly.  Much worse than the slaves from Africa.  As were the Asians, Hispanics, \& Irish.  The \textbf{African} slave cost a pretty penny.  It wasn't uncommon for a slave to cost \$700 to \$1000.  Back then?  That was a lot of money.  \textbf{Nobody} molly coddled the whites, Asians, Hispanics, Irish, etc... Sink or swim.  And what do you know?  That same group, sans the Africans, have risen above the past, refusing to let it affect their future.  They worked hard and proved themselves worthy.  \textbf{Black} people?  Well, take a look around you.  They are more vindictive and criminalistics than at any other time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  `\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}African, Black, Indian, Nobody, Race, Witch & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Ethnicity - Native-American, Gender - Female age and physical appearance & \cellcolor{green!27}10/366 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.732 \\  \hline

What you said was wrong and full of hate, and I found it very sad that you preach that kind of stuff to a big crowd of people at a pow wow.  Because of you, I have never come back to visit.  But just so you know.... guess who helps your elders out by calling the rez grocery store, and putting money on an account for them so they can eat???

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The election is coming, on main issue is with illegal immigration, no one is against immigration, but illegal immigration. They make the arguement that we are the illegal ones, came over here tooked form the indigenous people, and genocide them, but what really happened.what was written by the white settlers contradict this . Many facts are being ignored.Here are the facts, 1) Most of the settlers had \textbf{nothing} to do with what happened to the indigenous people, the truth is like only 1 percent of the people even had contact with the indigenous people, and with that only like 1 percent of those actually slaughtered them off. It was the kings and his loyalists that wiped them out. The Kings and his loyalists did alot that the church was getting blamed for. The same kings that the settlers were trying to escape from.2) The settlers that did made contact, most them worked with the indigenous people, were friends with the indigenous people even generations after. Including the mayflower pilgrims, they were also very friendly to them even after generations. Writtings confirmed this, this does not sound like anykind of genocide.3) Most of this land, so called indigenous people never even stepped foot on, so all we know, they probably did not even know that the land was even there, or what was in it.4) Most settlers that came over here, did not know anyone else was here, it was not until generations after the settlers came over here that they even knew aynone else was here, how could they be stealing land when they did not know anyone was over here. IT seems that the indigenous people had no intrest in the land that the settlers were on, or there would have been contact sooner.5) There is evidence that many cultures were over here, way before columbus(infact he only went on a few islands), even yes europe came over here, Vikings, Romans, Egyptain, Russia, Africans, some that are unknown. So maybe what we call indigenous people were not really the first ones over here.6) The records show that the so called indigenous people attacked us first, Jamestown Viriginia was the first major attack, and roanoke colony(which you can make the argument that no one knows for sure.) the Fact is tha they slaugthered us just as much as we slaughtered them. You can make the arguement about columbus, but here is the thing, Columbus was a criminal, but there is no way this could be in relatiation because no way that they could know.7) Also indigenous people slaughtered each other more so that we slaughtered them. Infact when they came over here, and could very well be people over here, and for all we know the so called indigenous people slaughtered them off.8) It is claimed that 20 million indigenous people were slaughtered, That is more than the population of europe at the time, and brittian is the only \textbf{nation} that had any real intrest in this area, their population was like only few hundred thousand, and out of that only a few thousand came over here, so it is a few thousand against millions.9) To make a book, it is not like today, were we can have the technology to put in machines and put it together, all of it is by hand mostly the process is a long and hard one at the time.

The UV rays would make many of then \textbf{blind} and their eyes evolved to help block the rays of the sun in high climates which is why their eyes are uniquely different. Then Asians crossed and settled in the American continent where it was much hotter, their skin got a brown/red pigment. Many settled in the frozen northern regions, many migrated further south into Mexico and Brazil. Their skin became darker and softer due to humidity creating the unique Aztec features.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small From Wiki:  [LINK] Europeans at the time of Christopher Columbus's voyage often referred to all of South and East Asia as "India" or "the Indias/Indies", sometimes dividing the area into "Greater India", "Middle India", and "Lesser India". The oldest surviving terrestrial globe, by Martin Behaim in 1492 (before Columbus' voyage), labels the entire Asian subcontinent region as "India".Columbus carried a passport in Latin from the Spanish monarchs that dispatched him ad partes Indie ("toward the regions of India") on their behalf. When he landed in the Antilles, Columbus referred to the resident peoples he encountered there as "Indians" reflecting his purported belief that he had reached the \textbf{Indian} Ocean. Although Columbus soon recognized that he had not reached the Indies, the name stuck; for centuries the native people of the Americas were collectively called "Indians" in various European languages. This misnomer was perpetuated in place naming; the islands of the Caribbean were named, and are still known as, the West Indies.In his book The Wind Is My Mother, the Muscogee writer Bear Heart (Nokus Feke Ematha Tustanaki) wrote: "When Columbus found the natives here, they were gentle people who accepted him, so Columbus wrote in his journal, 'These are people of God' ("una gente in Dios"). Later the 's' was dropped and Indio became \textbf{Indian}." However, as the writer David Wilton noted in his book Word Myths: Debunking Linguistic Urban Legends, this phrase does not appear in any of Columbus' writing. Wilton also says that since Greek and Roman times, more than a millennium before the voyages of Columbus, many European languages used variations of the term "\textbf{Indian}" to describe the peoples of the \textbf{Indian} subcontinent.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Indian & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Native-American & \cellcolor{green!5}4/278 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.439 \\  \hline

What would the world be like if we whites were never created,  and by that I mean we did not come from any of the other groups. We are a unique creation, just as the bible states. And the answer is. Small tribal groups constantly at some form of war, killing others for their possessions. Unfortunately we turned this practice into an artform by creating massive empires with huge armies, but the purpose is the same.  Wearing skins, or \textbf{nothing} at all, using stone \textbf{age} tools to do everything, were never blessed with the intelligence to do what we have proven we can do. No stone cutter city builders among them, We whites were created because GOD demands that HUMANS ascend ABOVE the stone \textbf{age}, that they would surely be stuck in forever. As recently as COLUMBUS, this is what was observed all over the Americas. They did not advance beyond the hunter gatherer ,tribal warfare mentality.If GOD removed all whites and our bastard offspring(mixed with white dna) from this world, come back in several thousand years, and we would find stone \textbf{age} groups living in the wreckage of our former cities and forests.While there has been a very corrupted group of elitists that are responsible for slavery and wars, the vast majority of whites are peaceful and would have made this an amazing world that would have been very beneficial to the stone \textbf{age} crowd. But since SIN is the reason for all the misery, they do not appreciate how we have lifted them out of the stone \textbf{age} and into a better world. Many of them do take advantage of it and have great lives, but most of them sit in the ashes beside their campfires playing the blame game, as they only hold out their hands, demanding we provide everything, while they contribute \textbf{nothing}.

Observations, and arguments, in proof of the American Indians being descended from the Jews. -History of the American Indians by James Adair page 14-15, published in 1775.When swine were first brought among them, they deemed it such a horrid abomination in any of their people to eat that filthy and impure food, that they excluded the criminal from all religious communion in their circular town-house, or in their quadrangular holy ground at the annual expiation of sins, equally as if he had eaten unsanctified fruits. After the yearly atonement was made at the temple, he was indeed re-admitted to his usual privileges. Formerly, none of their beloved men, or warriors, would eat or drink with us on the most pressing invitation, through fear of polluting themselves, they deemed us such impure animals. Our eating the flesh of swine, and venison, with the gravy in it, helped to rivet their dislike, for this they reckon as blood. -History of the American Indians by James Adair page 133-134, published in 1775.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Indian, Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s, Ethnicity - Native-American & \cellcolor{green!27}2/349 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.573 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small ...yeah. It was inevitable that you guys would've been slaughtered though. It's happening everywhere on both small (tribal) and large (European) scale. Do you think that America  will be conquered again in our lifetime. A guy on here said that you don't own what you can't protect. I think that may be true because there was a guy who claimed own to an asteroid and sent nasa a parking ticket and another guy who claimed that his land in the U.S. Was a country so he could make his daughter a princess, even made his own flag. Since we're all born on earth we can't actually say that any part is ours therefore you would have to have defenses to keep people off of land that naturally belongs to everyone. I don't need to explain how morally bankrupt pillaging and raping is but I think it's unavoidable right now if we shut down our military Russia and China would destroy us. When you are as powerful as America you don't really have to listen to anyone. It's amazing what humans are capable of, but the most capable people often simultaneously cause the most improvement and destruction. And on the disease thing, Europeans must have had a bulletproof immune system so if they got the sniffles it must have been like aids to tribes. On a related note, I remember reading that descendants of people who survived the \textbf{Black} Death/bubonic plague in Europe are immune to aids but I'm not completely sure.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small +Isnala'Nazin'Win Merchant-Ponds I agree with you. Science has its limits. And the prevalent culture in the world is that we accept everything science tells us, but science has itself changed its theories numerous times as more research is conducted. So, in reality, we humans don't know much and cannot tell when we will learn enough to make good judgements on anything. So, better not to judge anything or anyone, we need to be more prudent, more wise at the time we make conclusions and pass judgements. I have a deep love and respect for everyone but I also have native blood and understand that the world view of a person native to this land is simply different (as in we truly do not care for the way of life brought by the white man), and in my opinion, again in my sole opinion, native life was better back then. The natives were able to live in this land for a looong time, not as a backward society but as societies that worked well, respecting the land and every creature around them. To me, that is way better than what our society has so far achieved with going to the moon, creating GMO foods, farming salmon, creating plastics that in turn create garbage islands in the ocean, and so many other "great discoveries and advances" that really the only thing that have achieved is more illnesses, greater difference between the haves and the have nots, and so many wild life without their native habitats. But hey! we are told we have made great advances. Interesting that from my dally life all I know is that I don't know where my food comes from, my sister at 35 (a doctor in linguistics) died from cancer without having any cancer family history, and I (with a BA and numerous certificates) must work for a company to earn my sustenance because I cannot grow my own food or make my own fabrics to make clothes for myself and my family. So, even though my siblings and I are all university graduates we still live a life that is dependant on corporations, not on us. We are dependant on a salary.  So in short, all these great advances, are not that significant in the true and real and physical improvement of my standard of living. But hey they must improve some one else's life. I want to be closer to the land, be more self-sufficient as to creating my own goods to meet the needs of my family. But, as many do, I live in a small apartment on a small cheque. The way of life of the people native to this land is long gone, and still sounds like a great dream to me. And for those who will say that the natives had strange religious rituals where they scarified others, let me tell you it is \textbf{nothing} different from what is done today in some not so small religions. I don't justify it, and would not like it to come back, but I truly would like to have a society more connected to the land and more aware of its connection to and dependency on nature.  The natives like any other human beings were not perfect but they surely could live off the land without destroying it. And when we finish this planet off with all these wars, and with the "great discoveries" of companies as evil as Monsanto, tell me, what is going to be left? Moving to Mars?

If there are things happening to change that then the people need to unite and set it right. Blaming America for all the wrongs in the world just doesn't hold water when compared to all history.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Gabriel Bays Actually... We have archaeological evidence to suggest that there was a lot of wars and disputes between tribes. In fact many American Civilizations such as the Inca, the Maya, the Iroquois, ect were able to form states, empires, and confederacies off the back of warfare.So ingrained were many of these historical tribal rivalries that many times Europeans would align themselves with one side or another to get more resources. The same was true with many native groups. Many native groups aligned themselves with Europeans to fight against tribes that they historically had grievances with.It was actually \textbf{common} practice in many native cultures to adopted prisoners of conflicts into the tribe in order to have someone who spoke another tribe's language. It wasn't simply through intermarriage which actually discouraged among some tribes both in South and North America.Some tribes, like the Cherokee for instance also lost quite a large deal of territory and sovereignty when they aligned themselves with the Confederacy during the Civil war. The Cherokee are still facing many problems having to do with the decedents of natives and freed saves in regards to blood quantum laws.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Common & \cellcolor{green!5}Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}1/193 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.518 \\  \hline

Also you are spelling the \textbf{nation} of Colombia wrong, Columbia like in D.C. or the clothing brand is different. And while we are on that topic lets explore it a bit shall we? The Inca Empire expanded into southern Colombia and they were not "peaceful". At the time of the Spanish arrival the Inca were in the middle of a bloody civil war between the sons of the dead emperor and local tribes across the empire, that division allowed the Spanish to easily overpower them. Those divisions didn't spring up overnight due to the arrival of the Spanish, they had been there for thousands of years due to Inca military expansion. Also there is absolutely no evidence to support that settlers intentionally gave natives "smallpox infested blankets", which is something nearly every historian points out when asked about this topic. You are basing a claim of intentional harm on something that may or may not have occurred. Natives with no immune capability for western diseases could catch things by simply walking past someone which would in turn spread it to thousands of others.

That's fool-proof logic that only a person severely dedicated to their own hatred would ignore.As for your other false \textbf{race} qualifier, the so called "lack of knowledge", I can't even begin to imagine the twist of logic you had to use to reach that conclusion, but the majority of people who share your beliefs on aboriginal residents of America are going to be college-level white students, not people who tend to be struggling for survival.As for 2Pac, he had a surprising amount of self-critical judgement, something you severely lack. 2Pac actually admitted in his final days that he had, despite being outspoken against it, become a \textbf{racist} in the process. His problem, as a rapper who made most of his money selling albums to white people, would be with a person like you - a person who would think that only a particular \textbf{race} can actually like and respect him. You can lay your fears to rest though, since I openly do not subscribe to your \textbf{racist}, twisted logic, it wouldn't make sense for me to care about what \textbf{race} I am and how best I can hide it.

Then you speak of all sorts of things you know \textbf{nothing} about and demand I bend to you when all you have is a position of ignorance. I don't think you can be helped. You mentality is too presumptive and dogmatic. I say this not from assumptions but from things that you've actually said.

Know anything about those cultures? You say our culture is all around you and that is not true at all. That would be like me saying I know everything about each individual native tribe because I went to a souix or seminole reservation. As far as understanding your challenges, I'd say that gets more coverage in your country via the many facets of media, educators and politicos, being rivalled only by blacks and the gays in your country which is crammed-down everybody's throats 24/7. Lets face it, "amerika" is proof that melting-pot nations fail because \textbf{nobody} wants to unite under one culture, flag or \textbf{nation} but would rather have their own "special my culture \& \textbf{ethnic}  \textbf{race} only" communities while reaping the benefits of others and the government \& people you detest. Like I said, your country doesn't have too much longer on the world scene as a world power because YOU are your own worst enemies.
