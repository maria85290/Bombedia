It is deeply hurtful when people believe such terrible lies. I am REALLY upset. I worked hard and behaved well to build a life out of hardship, a single parent's kid and I did it to be reduced to THIS? EVERYBODY let it happen. I now have nightmares that racists will chemically \textbf{dumb} me down to the \textbf{racist} stereotype they want me to be and frame me for crimes I did not commit.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Racism will never go away if we continue to say the problem still exists. "Just accept it and be aware" is something I get told all the time about white privilege. But what does that accomplish? Privilege isn't something I do, and being aware of it doesn't allow me to change my actions so I don't "do" privilege anymore. I need to make three points. First, I've heard people say that \textbf{black} people can't be \textbf{racist}, because they're the minority or the victims, and that simply isn't correct. Anyone, anyone can behave in a \textbf{racist} manner. It is an act that requires two people only, and all it takes is for one of these people to treat the other differently because of their \textbf{race} to have behaved in a \textbf{racist} manner. Second. The term people of color is the concept of separate but equal in disguise. "As a person of color..." If you say this, why are you celebrated? Because you're a minority? Like the color of your skin gives you the right to have a more valuable opinion or insight? You might have experiences that others can't relate to, but so does a white person. No one deserves special treatment because of their \textbf{race}. If I said "as a white person..." and expected people to listen to me and respect me because of that, I'd be labeled \textbf{racist}. The term people of color creates a split of everyone in the world between "white people" and "the rest of the world". And it creates the idea that a person of color should be celebrated while a white person deserves no celebration. It is a direct mirror of early \textbf{racism} in the states. One "racial group" is better than another is what it says. Let's look at the above definition of \textbf{racism}. Wow, "POC" is \textbf{racist}! And something \textbf{racist} won't solve \textbf{racism}. Third, privilege itself has \textbf{nothing} to do with \textbf{race}. Privilege is the phenomenon that occurs in a society when one individual's way of life, i.e. their language, customs, etc. are close to the "standard" way of life in that society. The closer your life is to that standard, the more privilege you have. Standard ways of life are normal. These standards are what unify societies. Don't believe me? In an \textbf{African} village with a strong identity and culture, a member of that tribe who speaks the language is privileged. If I went there, I would not have privilege, because I do not speak the language and I do not understand the culture. I will face a natural struggle to fit in. So the question becomes, how do you tell if someone's life is close to the standard? In America, the country was founded by white people who had an established culture. This culture became the "American" culture historically, and its the culture America operates on still today, for reasons I will explain shortly. In the past, the easiest way to know was to look at the appearance of the person. Back then you could easily tell \textbf{race} and economic status based on appearance. This is how \textbf{race} became involved. Back then it wasn't easy to travel long distances, meaning if you didn't look white, you weren't a "local tribesman" of America, and so you had less privilege. Now back then people actively sought out less privileged individuals to take advantage of them. Everyone getting mad about white privilege today act like that's what white people still do, which also is incorrect. It's all subconscious now, and like I said simply calling it out won't change it. Here's what will. Privilege won't ever go away. It's a natural phenomenon. What you can do is change the variables. You can change the standard which life is compared to and you can change the things used to assume, and as it is subconscious and unavoidable, assuming will occur. The standard way of life in America has remained unchanged because to change the standard way of life is to change the values of the society, something that can't be done without unity. When America was founded, there was unity among the colonies, the states. Today, America is divided on the racial issue (Poc vs. White). Because of this, those values haven't changed. Also, the assuming factors are still racial, a broken (and bad) model as America has become very diverse, with Americans coming from everywhere and extremely diverse looking, and this model leads to \textbf{racism}. What do we do? Based on the goal of racial equality and \textbf{gender} equality and in general equality, we need to first unify ourselves. Create an American identity that is updated. America is not white people. America is diverse. Stop hating America. Create an American identity. \textbf{Nationalism}. Create a value we can be proud of. And then, stop using \textbf{race} to decide who is or is not American. If we can do this, the privilege goes back to where it should be, between domestic and foreign. You all have to accept that privilege is natural. It's just in the wrong place and was used for the wrong reasons. Privilege in which one \textbf{nation} is not privileged in another is completely normal, and not at all bad. In this context it creates pride. Once this change occurs, \textbf{racism} can begin to heal and go away. This man simply pointed it out. It takes more than that to demolish \textbf{racist} undertones in our country. Final thought: yes I said domestic vs. foreign. That doesn't mean be \textbf{racist} to foreigners. It means you need to accept that foreigners will be less privileged in your country and to ease that struggle rather than try to pretend the struggle doesn't exist or try to make someone else struggle instead. And as well, it's okay to have American pride. It doesn't make you \textbf{racist} or anti-immigration. If you are proud of your country, you should want people to join in. That being said, naturalization is necessary. Immigrate legally. Don't help people immigrate illegally, but rather try to change naturalization laws so they don't have to immigrate illegally. But I digress. Long story short, the issue about \textbf{racism} is disguised and the solution blocked by a wild goose chase of calling people \textbf{racist}, using \textbf{racism} to fight \textbf{racism}, and biased media and attention. \textbf{Race} doesn't matter. You can't use your \textbf{race} to end \textbf{racism} and you can't use your privilege to fight privilege. Accept that, and accept that goose chase battles are a waste of time. I'm fighting the real battle. What battle will you fight? Remember the saying "we stand United. We'll never be divided"? We is America. Not one minority group, not all pocs against white people.

And knowing the experiences of these men and considering them to be true, at what point or amount of people would any group need for their feelings or opinions to be seriously considered as valid in a social context?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small It's great to learn about America's tragic history, and to be aware of the vestiges of it where they actually exist and to the degree they actually exist.However, we all know about slavery, thanks. We all know about lynching and the KKK. We all know it's bad, and have since before I was born. Just like we all know about the Holocaust. It is NOT alive and well today. We do NOT live in a white supremacist country, and there is no more "systemic" \textbf{racism}. There is no legal segregation (in fact there was mandatory integration in my public schools). You were never a slave. No living white person today has ever owned a slave or lynched anyone. Police kill twice as many whites as blacks. The most likely people to get shot by the police are people who commit crimes, especially violent crimes, and then resist arrest.Do we blame Germans born after the Holocaust for the extermination camps? No. Why not? Because we know they had \textbf{nothing} to do with it. Wouldn't it be ridiculous to blame some German child born yesterday for the Holocaust? Is there a statute of limitations on guilt at birth?So, again, great to learn about the past, but to pretend things haven't changed and to brand innocent white people with white supremacy and crimes they never committed in the slightest is shading into scapegoating and demonizing people based on \textbf{race}.Are you responsible for HIroshima? You're American, aren't you. Are you responsible for the war on Iraq? Well, you're an American. Are you responsible for all  the crimes men have committed against women, or adults have committed against children? Ridiculous, you say? It's just as ridiculous to blame average white people for slavery as for stealing \textbf{Indian} land or the Boston Tea Party. It's as accurate as blaming Jews or Romans today for crucifying Christ.I'd probably be more interested in your actual experience of \textbf{racism} in you life, as well as your experience of non-\textbf{racism} (including have an art career and your art shown in white-owned galleries and museums).

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I probably should've known better than to read comments, but I couldn't help it, and am incredibly disappointed. Many are completely ignoring the ideas put forth in this video and stating that the speaker did not 'explain' systemic \textbf{racism}. You realize that's part of the problem, right? That it's difficult to point it out? He emphasized how subtlety of systemic \textbf{racism} in America makes it such a difficult battle. It seems a handful of you chose to ignore that. I think a lot of people's misunderstanding of 'systemic \textbf{racism}' comes from phraseology. When one refers to 'systemic \textbf{racism},' one isn't talking about explicit government-sanctioned discrimination or some obvious act like that. 'Systemic' refers more to how many aspects of our society have underlying elements governed by \textbf{racism}, especially our economy. I was really glad he emphasized how he American economic system was largely impacted by the practice of chattel slavery. Slavery was essentially one of the most formative aspects of the early United States, and everything from its practice to its abolition affected discrimination against blacks. Many are calling this 'race-baiting' but I see no semblance of that here to be perfectly honest. He is not attempting to stir up sentiment against others. Nowhere does he imply that one group of people are the problem and we need to be the solution. He is talking about symbols and systems, but many of you are treating it like he's attacking you directly, which is quite telling.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Racism & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}4/245 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.633 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Is This Rain? There have been many poor \textbf{ethnic} groups in western countries. In fact, the initial settlements by virtually every \textbf{ethnic} group tends to be dirt poor. A good example of this is Chinese immigration during the California gold rush; they were manual laborers who literally built railroads with hand tools. Yet violent crime is lower in Chinese communities compared to national averages wherever they go in the West, and there is no evidence of high rates of crime amongst poor east asian communities in the west. The same goes for \textbf{Indian} communities, but not for Pakistani communities. Wanna know why? Culture, not poverty. Indians and Pakistanis are ethnically similar, but culturally different, particularly with religion, and that makes all the difference.So to conclude, I agree that we need to tackle the problem at its source, but the source is not poverty. In fact, poverty is often another consequence of the source, which is culture.

In fact, the two men later admitted to doing it in a magazine interview, but could not stand double jeopardy. In my opinion that was a miscarriage of justice that did happen, but those are the cases that make national news because they are so extreme. I would not say that is how the American legal and court system works frequently and as a rule.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Jarful of Love Psychological literature suggests a slight difference between male and female agressivity. At least in western societies. The magnitude of this effect is 60 40. Meaning if you were to see a man and a \textbf{woman} and were to guess at the man being more agressive you'd be right 60 of the time. Criminals however aren't the average person, they are the extremes at the agressive end of the distribution. And while both distributions are normally distributed, the mens one is a bit more to the right. The problem here is that a slight effect at the middle will make a huge effect at the ends of the distribution. The principle is called paredo principle. As for \textbf{black} people. Hmm, yes there might be some effect of \textbf{racism}. However, since there are no laws anymore that prefer white people over \textbf{black} people, i am not confident that's the only reason. \textbf{Black} people tend to come from a lower socioeconomic background, which, in western cultures of these times is associated with worse education, and a lack of belief in government. Therefore bam: perfect reason why \textbf{black} people, who are on average worse off than white people would appear to be more criminal than others. Mind you: white people of low SES should be just as criminal, as would latinos or asians. However, since asians and whites normally have a good SES, they tend to be less criminal.And that's without accusing youth culture of antieducation or gangsta culture. These might become relevant if my factors aren't enough. Mind you: i am from Essen in germany. The only thing that predicts crime and sucess is the area you live in.

Either way. multiculturalism  as a social experiment has been shown and admitted to being a complete and utter failure in every case where it has been attempted on a grand scale such as Europe and The US. Acceptance of every other culture into mixed societies has failed at every level and as such, forced integration has been proven to not work. And the most  incredible thing is that the failure has not come from the side of acceptance , but rather it has  been strictly a failure on the part of the \textbf{immigrant} culture. A failure to adapt to their new surroundings. A failure to learn the native language. A failure to adapt to their politics, religions, music, clothing etc... It has led to simply creating more of a segregated society than existed before attempting to force Multiculturalism down everybody's throat.  The fact is that there are huge differences between cultures and trying to force their integration has only led to further issues which too many of the supporters of multiculturalism's  have now labeled as \textbf{Racism}.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Idan Zamir, the problem with comment is that you think \textbf{racism}  only includes slavery and that is it, well i am here to tell you \textbf{racism} is not only about slavery, it is about the institutions that helped \textbf{racism} take a hold in the US. \textbf{Racism} deals with years after reconstruction where laws were written to determine where a \textbf{African} American could live, what schools that \textbf{African} American will attend, how much funding and what will be taught in those schools. It deals with such laws as vagrancy, where a \textbf{African} American could be locked up on the suspicion he did not have a job. It deals with the establishment of \textbf{Jim C\textbf{row}} laws, again governing where a \textbf{African} American could live, redlining, criminal justice. Less you forget (since you did say in your later comments), we are only maybe 48 years from the passage of the civil rights bill, and even then it was not fully implemented until maybe the mid 80s. So yeah, a lot of people's grandparents are alive and still benefited from \textbf{racism}. My mom is 68 years \textbf{old}, she was a teenager during the Civil Rights era and its turmoil, the US has a president whose farther actively participated in \textbf{racism}. So don't you dare say no one was alive when all this was going on.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small S E Except that's not the case anymore, because education is free for everyone, so no matter how poor you are you can get the education you need to rise out of poverty if you put in the work, it isn't just luck that allows people to obtain wealth. There are countless scholarships in the United States made available exclusively to racial minorities and first-generation college students, so there are also plenty of opportunities for poor students to obtain a college education if they put in the work. In fact, I would argue that it is easier for a poor \textbf{black} to get a college education than a poor white because of all the additional scholarships and other financial resources as well as affirmative action programs that are afforded to them solely on the basis of their \textbf{race}, which is the textbook definition of \textbf{racism}, but apparently it isn't considered \textbf{racist} if the descriminatory advantage is given to people who aren't white.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Race, Racism, Racist & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General & \cellcolor{green!5}4/162 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.469 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small S EMany issues in the US had little to do with \textbf{race}, and all to do with wealth. Even when "African-Americans" were trying to get equal treatment back in the day, they also fought for poor White Americans to be treated better too. In fact, some "Whites" were seen as inferior, and stupid, to other "Whites". This alone shows why it's entirely stupid to judge purely based on whether someone is "White" or not when a "White" person from X country saw a "White" from Z country as utterly inferior and not worth living.Also, may I ask why do Asians, a minority group that was historically treated poorly in the US and initially all worked jobs no one wanted, is currently dominating even White Americans for average income? Why did they go from working jobs no one wants, to being \textbf{doctors}, dentists, programmers, etc? They were not given the head starts, the financial assistance, or the free jobs/education while being under qualified like "African-Americans" were, but yet, they succeed. Why is that?Here's why. Asians have a completely different culture and mindset than every other group in the world. They have very high expectations from their peers and family, and on an individual level, they actually want to be independent and succeed. They are also very likely to mix with other "races" when it comes to friendships or relationships compared to "African-Americans".Just take one look at the "African-American" culture, look at how successful "African-Americans" are bullied simply for pointing out the issue is a cultural one.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Race, doctors & \cellcolor{green!27}Ethnicity - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!27}2/259 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.772 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Apparently, the TED community is full of hateful people. Also, the share of \textbf{racist} hateful people is exaggerated by bots and people having alt-accounts to upvote and answer to their own comments. I'm almost sure this "Big Willie" guy is one of those. His comments get lots of upvotes suspiciously fast and the first few answers are always very similar and only a few minutes apart. That's tricking the YouTube algorithm basics. His views also seem to always align with the opposite of what the speaker says. (I also noticed the same accounts replying to each other over and over again on every video.)I don't want to put it all on trolls and some criticism is very correct about TED, although IMO they have become better again but still, the proportion of hateful comments and dislikes is suspicious. There are probably also a lot of people that truly believe in what they write but in my experience, many simply jump on the bandwagon and if you ask them a concrete question, they can't answer. TED is an easy target nowadays but going back to science only is also no solution. The fact that this hate-machinery exists is the reason TED can't stop making these videos, we need the discourse even if it is disrupted regularly, without it there will be no progress.Another trend is the awful reductionism that seems to spread. Whenever anyone makes a point, people on the internet assume that this is everything that this person is and that the person claims that their problem is the only one worth working on. But that's not true (most of the time). Life is complex, there is a seemingly infinite multitude of problems and just because somebody says that one problem is worth working on, doesn't mean they claim that all other problems are not. It is the same as the SpaceX argument: "Why do you waste all that money and work on space exploration when there are so much more pressing issues on earth." I think the response was something like this: "There are so many companies focusing on earth-problems, what's wrong when one company works on space-problems?"And that is exactly the point. Multiple things can be important at the same time and have to be worked on at the same time. Reductionism makes me sick.Just look at this argument a few comments up:"The Democrats founded the KKK" (which had \textbf{nothing} to do with the actual argument of the comment, which was that people mostly segregate themselves)-"Yes but since then there has been a major shift in the parties politics""There has been no party shift because Hillary Clinton called somebody her "friend and mentor" that was a KKK member."Am I insane or is this not even an argument?

He first ran for President in 1964 but lost the democratic primary but got an electoral vote if I recall correctly.In 1968 he ran as an independent and won 5 southern states.He ran again in 1972 and 1976, losing.Richard Nixon, president from 1969 to 1974, saw an oppourtinity. He saw the \textbf{old} 'Dixiecrats' were breaking away from the Democrats because of civil rights.He could harness white anger and get those Southern votes in what he called 'the southern strategy.' He harnessed racial animosity through coded language about drugs and 'law and order.' (We know this to be fact due to later interviews and the white house tapes.)When Ronald Reagan won the Republican nomination in 1980, it was the first time there was a presidential \textbf{race} without George Wallace since the civil rights act.Reagan had to secure those southern votes. What was the first place he went to campaign as the nominee?To a fair near Philadelphia Mississippi.This place was famous because 3 civil rights advocates, Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner were murdered in this county in 1964. The locals did a sham investigation because the whole community was in on it.It took the FBI to come in amd bring justice.What was the first thing future president Ronald Reagan said, as the new nominee, in the county known for murdering civil rights advocates and covering it up?"I Believe in States Rights!"Sounds a lot like Wallace, doesnt it?Thats when all the \textbf{old} unrepentant Dixiexrats like Strom Thurmond, Jessie Helms, David Duke, ect ect switched parties.Thats why the Charlottesville 'unite the RIGHT' rally had both Nazis and KKK.Im not saying all Republicans are KKK, not at all.

When a \textbf{black} shoots a white, the amount of times they recieve indemnity is statistically insignificant. (Stats are from a few years ago)This pattern fits historical \textbf{racism} in the United States, as the 2nd Amendment was always designed to allow whites to police white space.  To oppress restive natives and uppity slaves.Just 2 centuries ago the Mississippi river was lined with severed \textbf{black} slave heads. Just last century a \textbf{black} men could be tortured to death by grievous matulation culminating in slowly burning to death feet first. Whites would not be punished.Today, white men are encouraged to shoot \textbf{black} men with indemnity thanks to SYG....Also, voter supression laws. Just google 'Republican admits voter supression racist' and you will get tons of hits from multiple states....And if we want to expand this, Arizona recently had their 'show me your paper laws,' which meant that hispanics would be pulled over more and the cops would demand their citizenship or immigration paperwork.  Let me ask you, do you keep your SSN or birth certificate on you at all times? If youre hispanic and in Arizona, the answer better be yes or else....And lastly, it is legal to fire or evict someone simply for being LGBTQ in more than half of the US states.

He wants to make sure \textbf{nobody} moves on and everyone knows more about it, than they ever would have, otherwise.  That gives them new fuel to be bitter and angry and continue dividing us into more and more segmented groups, rather than just being AMERICANS!  Let us focus more on the fact that we (the US) did not begin institution of slavery in the Americas, but that we DID FIGHT A WAR with ourselves, to end it.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Gogeta... no, I did not say any of that.  What I am saying is that too many people are focusing on the worst part of our history and trying to further divid is with that.  I am saying the truth, that slavery in the America's started 200 years before there was ever a US.  I am telling you the little known fact that 70 of the founders wanted to end slavery BEFORE they even signed the Declaration of Independence, and argued more over THAT, than any other thing.  In the end, they realized that the colonies who wanted to keep it, were never going to change their minds.  Realizing that, they decided to first gain independence from the throne of England, then abolish slaver later.  We are the only \textbf{nation} on Earth to have fought a war WITH ITSELF, to end slavery.  That is a historical fact and all I'm saying, is let's stop focusing on the mere fact that there WAS slavery (we already know that) and at give credit where credit is due... the US brought an end to an institution that it DID NOT itself, create.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Nation & \cellcolor{green!5}Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/189 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.529 \\  \hline

Try challenging his argument from that perspective and see what you can come up with. Share if you come up with anything, then we can all improve future dialogue on the subject.

It was the Democratic party created and supported slavery in America, Segregation, and the KKK.

People also forget Africans, Natives, and so on also had slaves from their own \textbf{race} and others. They wanted people to forget that, so it makes it seem like whites were the only ones who did and were all powerful, when it's not true. Seriously look up Natives owning \textbf{African} Slaves, and Kidnapping European children. Look up \textbf{African}-American slave owners like Anthony Johnson and so on. 3. How do you stop it?
