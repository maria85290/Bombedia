  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Okay, that girl with the four Macbooks trying to start a crowdfunding campaign to replace one of them when she dealt some...minor, trivial damage to it (but it wasn't her fault at all :P!)?

I refuse to believe otherwise.Unfortunately, I have \textbf{zero} basis to believe any of the others aren't anything but real.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small 1. Every kid has a right to be stubborn with his parents over food. You don't need to be really rich parents to experience such a situation.2. The way a child behaves with his parents with respect to money is entirely their family matter. Rest assured, \textbf{nobody} else is ever more entitled to their money than their own kids.Your hate for spoiled rich kids is actually your hate for money and that's why you will probably not get enough money in life. If one feels entitled to hate rich families and their kids simply because they can't afford it themselves or aren't able to take advantage of those families, then that person/group deserves psychiatric treatment on acceptable social behavior and learn to live a life of dignity more so having a life of their own so that (s)he doesn't poke his/her nose into other matters. It's entirely their family thing and if the kids' parents have no problem, \textbf{nobody} is entitled to comment. In fact, you might be very close to a defamation lawsuit which again you may not have much money to fight.If one can't make it, one should never comment on others' wealth. The only thing that such behavior exhibits is jealousy and hatred or an attempt to gaslight others to take their money. That's a pretty nasty move and talks about very bad schooling and parenting for such people.Maybe psychiatrists should come up with a \textbf{mental} health disease for such people.Don't hate others because they are successful. Be inspired and work towards building your own success so that your family gets a better life. Fix your thinking before somebody calls you plain stupid or an a**hole at best.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Mental, Nobody & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}3/286 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.049 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small My cousin is like this she has never worked a day in her life. She just got married and he father has purchased her 4 brand new cars including a BMW she had a destination wedding in the Dominica of Republic. She got in a fight with her father because he calls his grandson Grandson so she was upset with him fro not calling him by his name, It was petty  since she has had him her dad has paid for him to do sports like basket ball T ball Soccer all his cloths and her cloths put a roof over their head and she ponds her son off on both her parents.She does this to go to movies bowling country music concerts all paid for n her daddies credit cards. Her mother just went to the parent teach conference last week for her boy because she and her new husband just did not want to be bothered to do so. Her dad refused to go to her wedding and he has given her access to all his bank accounts credit cards you name it, She is 27 years \textbf{old} and since he refused to go to her wedding she has taken it upon her self to go in to all his accounts and steal \$12,000.00. He was very upset When I told him to block her and press charges he said he would not do that. I blame the parents they do this to these kids and these kids have no limitations or boundaries and at 27 years \textbf{old} she does not understand or acknowledged the word no, There is no respect for them selves so they have little regard or respect for others because they were never taught. Charges should have been brought upon the 19 year \textbf{old} stealing her mothers rings. A good \textbf{old} fashion spanking should have been given to the boys at the restaurant. The Girl in Utah will turn out like my Cousin she should be taught now while she is young that spoiling the child should be considered as child endangerment and the kid should be taken from the mother for child abuse  for not parenting the kid. They should be required to go to counseling. As far as Laptop Girl all the electronics should be removed out of her possession and he mother also should be brought up on charges for child abuse and parenting classes and counseling should be given to the family.But we don't have such laws and these people become our public leaders and the boss of daddies company and we are left to contend with their bad behaviors in our society.WHAT A SHAME !!!!\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}4/446 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.897 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I'll admit, I was pretty spoiled growing up in the sense I usually got what I wanted EVENTUALLY. Like, I might say, "Mom, I really, really want a Gameboy. Can I get one? Please?" in like May or June, and I'd get it for either Christmas or my birthday (which is February, typically right after my mother got her tax return). But, I almost never got something expensive right there on the spot (unless it was new shoes, which I burned through like \textbf{crazy} as a child, and I admittedly always wore expensive shoes because of a broken foot/ankle I received in the womb when I lodged my foot into my mother's ribs and it had to be maneuvered back out, which meant had had to have very high topped shoes in my early childhood for support so my ankle didn't collapse). Even at Christmas, I knew that my mother was paying for the gifts, not Santa. (She told me Santa picked them up from layaway and delivered them, but she had to pay for them.) I never wanted for anything, but I knew where the money came from and was never a tantrum throwing \textbf{brat} when I was told we couldn't get something. I was sad and upset (disappointed upset, not scream my lungs out and lay down in the floor and kick and yell upset), but I knew that no meant no. I now work in retail, and I've seen some ridiculous tantrums happen at my register, tantrums that I NEVER would have gotten by with as a child, and I can't help but wonder where everything went wrong?

If that were me i would just either go sit in the bathroom till my food is there then go back out eat it and \textbf{leaver} or i would just stand up and leave. But its kinda the parents fault i mean come on if yiu dont want them to act like that in the restuarant then dont bring them or teach them manners. Then this girl who is stealing from her parents and boyfriend. Like come on. How can she get so many cars i mean cant they see she is in debt when she is buying another car. Why do you need so many lipsticks and brushes, instead of selling your mothers priceless rings go sell all the makeup you dont use, or the cars you dont drive. Why is her boyfriend staying with her when she acts like this. Its kinda his fault for staying with her instead of leaving her he just lets her scream and throw things till she gets the money she wants. She admits to being spoiled but doesnt change anything. WHY!!!! She even throws her bills away where are the cops she isnt paying anything off.Now there is a girl in 1st grade getting a 32,000 dollar birthday party. Like is this what the "cool parents" do because if so i need to help my mom get up to date. Because why this girl getting a 32 grand dollar birthday im getting sleepovers with my besties for my birthday. And i love it its fun just to sit and have fun without worry about if my cake is perfect. Like the girl gets mad because the bird on her really fancy cakes is off color. LIKE WHAT???? She gets a 2,000 dollar dress and im over here wearing my 2 year \textbf{old} dress that still fits and i love it.  Come on if your going to get a 32,000 dollar birthday at the least be greatful for itOh and now were getting started on the girl with 4 macbooks ad 2 phones. Like im over here happy with my samsung chromebook why shes crying to the camera about her mest up keyboard and a  scratch on it. Why do you need 4 diffrent computers like we all know that you can receive and text messages and block people on the same darn computer so instead of crying to us about your darn financial problems go give your mom her work computer beck and your 2 year \textbf{old} sister her dress back. Oh dont forget about giving mommy and daddy there phones back i mean wow you got mad about the color diffrence in an amazing phone. I have one question for you ; Do you have any friends,any friends at all?  I mean the show you just put on for the camera was just sad. I bet if the t key fell off she would have said the same thing that she said for the w key falling off. LOL. This is by far one of the most spoiled bratty kids ever. UUGGGHHHI really have \textbf{nothing} to say about the last person. Like who sues there parents for not giving her money, then asks for 600 dollars a weak. Then comes back to live with them. I am not going to lie i kinda blame the parents on this one. Not for the sueing part but you realise you let your daughter be a complete jerk to you guys then you let her move back in with you. Like how is that going to teach her a lesson. You realise you let her win she was a jerk did what she wanted then came running back hime to mommy and daddy for a place to live.

If it bothers you that much just get a case. They're not that expensive. The "w" key stands for "wimp" by the way. She's in no place to ask for money. Just sell the phone you didn't want. Or even better, one of your macbooks. Edit: Did she do the video for a joke? If so, then all is forgiven. But one question remains, where did she get the four macbooks?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small 1- Having the first child should have been enough to want to throttle any others at birth. That aside, L2P people. Learn 2 Parent. Father get's smacked, and he backs off? What the Hell. Just bitch-slap that child into submission...well I guess not in this touchy-feely bullshit world we live in these days. I was a (mostly) perfectly obedient child. You know why? Coz if I'd acted like a shit like those three, I'd have had a date with The Buckle-End later that evening.. 2- This creature is too \textbf{old} to be supported by it's parents. Cut it off. I also contest this talk of "boy-friend" - unless it's referring to some electronic device, although I'm not sure how it would ask for money. As for it's credit companies, repossess everything now before it gets pawns it. This creature will end up in jail. As for the mother, please disown this monster, change all your locks or better yet, move home without a forwarding address. 3- This trauma is down to the idiocy of the parents. When it comes down to it, she's a little girl, and they're happy to spoil her. The parents have too much money on their hands - but money can't buy love - especially if you keep throwing it at the problem. Which is why this kid takes everything for granted and will prolly end up a drug-addict.4- This looks staged to me, but even for a skit, you'd think after the first Mac book, they'd have realized it was a mistake to buy in the first place, and exchange it for something of similar value...like a calculator. What idiot throws money at \textbf{Apple}? Their stuff is designed to fail so they can wring more more out of you. I could also point out that a key should simply clip back on, unless say you hit the keyboard with a lump-hammer, so you really don't need a dime to fix that.5-  This moron is just acting up. Fair enough, her parents demanding she break up with her boyfriend is the wrong move (don't hate me here, even if the guy is a total asshat, and a bad influence - that's something she'll just have to learn for herself, not something a parent should take responsibility for...unless he's peddling drugs, or pimping her out - in which case they should call the police directly, not attempt to solve for themselves) but the kid is just being influenced by Hollywood stupidity.

We hid behind a pillar, and after a few seconds I went back and she fell on the carts. And she has the NERVE to say I pushed her.  I keep telling her that I didn't push her but she doesn't care. Once she even hit me with a board when I took one of her two ketchup packets. I still have a t shaped bruise from one YEAR ago. It's even still green!!She even says she has a "fashion sense". What fashion sense do you have, you're a kid!! I swear, she is a spoiled \textbf{brat}!! She expects people to just give her anything she wants!

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small So, small story. There was a girl that bought the iPhone 7 when it came out and she spent a lot of money on it (like \$700-\$800). And In the first week she had it. She broke the glass on the a little bit of camera and the camera quality was just the absolute same. But she insisted it messed up her pictures all the time so I took her phone and took burst photos and didn't see a single problem. She ended buying the new phone only to do the same thing to the new one she just bought and then her mother literally had enough, so she bought the iPhone X and that was it after like couple of months of complaining.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Well one time my 12 yr \textbf{old}  cousin was in the ocean with my 10 yr \textbf{old} sister, and my twelve yr \textbf{old} cousin was apperently "drowning" (jumping up in down in the water) while my ten year \textbf{old} sis was standing in place right next to her. (Mind this, my 12 yr \textbf{old} cousin takes swim team, and she is able to swim down 13 feet) I'd say she was in 4 feet in the ocean. So in came the life gaurd came in to rescue her. But when she got up to my aunt (her mom) she replied with "But mom I dropped my friend's bracelet!" The thing is she had NO bracelets on her before she was in the water. Also she said to the rest of my family that she was drowning when her mom went shopping later. Keep reading for another dramatic thing she did later that nightSO in the afternoon we went back to our grandparents beach house. Our grandfather has a rule that you can't jump off the porch into the mulch near the grass. My same 12 yr cousin did it. My grandfather saw and came out to speak with her. She was over dramatic saying stuff like "But I didn't!" Or "I was safe though!"  Soon enough my grandfather left into thge house. Then she said "I'm just gonna go live with someone else!"  So she went down and around the block (We have a BIG neighborhood there) about 30 mins of walking. So when she came back for dinner she sat next to me at the counter and I asked "So you didn't find a good enough new family?" She replied with "What are you talking about?" Her lying annoyed me, I said "Well, you said that you would find a new family!" This got our family's attention she noticed them watching and said "Uh no I didn't!"  This time I said "Oh so you won't admit?" Her mom heard this, but she got away with it.Edit: Hey, I took time out of my day to write this so plz no hate.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I think i could top that. These are two instances of many.  So back when  I'm in my early teens, like 13 or 14. and I have very close friends of the family who I've called cousins since birth (children of my parents high school friends). anywho during a summer vacation we had met up with numerous of these families who were staying at one of Alberta hot Spring resorts. This resort has waterslides. Now thinking as responsible older child I would go down the slide first and wait near the bottom to make sure the smaller children (10 or younger) get out okay. One of them (already known to be a bit of a liar) was floundering when she came out the slide as it was a bit too deep for her.  Everything turned out fine as I helped her out of the pool and continued on her merry little way. Days later do I find out that she told her mom that I was Actively trying to drown her.  Now... fast forward round 7 or 8 years. Camping with the same families and I'm hanging with the my brother and the other 'cousins' who are my \textbf{age}.  We've been  playing some drinking games for bout an hour when the same girl(still under legal drinking \textbf{age}) walks up with one of her friends who came out with her family, they what to join us. We say sorry and refuse to give them any of our drinks(wouldn't be cool). They return in bout 15 mins with a bottle of liqour and says that her dad gave it to her and was okay with them drinking(lie).  Of course they both get pretty drunk and get busted by her father when they returned to their trailer. Now instead of owning up she blamed the rest of us saying that we gave her the \textbf{alcohol}. Which actually ended up with us getting cussed out by the father until the truth was brought to light.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, alcohol & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Behavioural Addiction - Alcohol & \cellcolor{green!5}3/331 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.906 \\  \hline

He has alot of plushies 60 in his room and 100 in the garage. He could have been yelling 160 times. His parents  don't tell him any thing exept his older sister tells his mom that he is throwing a tantrum.  He yells so loud people can hear him from 5 apartment rooms. He even has his own phone and he is barley 7 years \textbf{old}, he can't even be trusted. He yells and throws tantrums every day and he even throws tantrums at Build A Bear Workshop, he complains that he needs clothing for his 40 bears . He is so rude to me and my sister and cousin Jessica ( his sister ) he even is a pervert by saying that me and my sister will be married.  Bruh, we are family and that is illegal.  He blames me for stuff he did. Benjamin is gross and  \textbf{weird} by keeping a picture of the girl he likes in his closet.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Ok for me I only get one gift on my birthday although it's kinda expensive like 60 dollars it's not that big of a party and we normally don't celebrate that much because all of my family's birthdays are in large groups as in 6 birthdays a month that's for an example also I don't have a time to get home because well I stay inside a lot but I also have some extremely rare stuff for example two hyper rare charazard cards which are in mint condition so around a thousand dollars and a stuff animal that's 700 so ya I'm pretty lucky but their is one thing about the stuff I have that are rare both the charazard cards had been obtained through two different ways one I got out of a card pack the other was given to me by my uncles friend who didn't want his collection so he gave me it all it had the trio of venisaur Blastoise and charazard the hyper rates which I'm surprised he didn't sell them but it was kind but I was kind to two of my friends and gave them the venisaur and the other blastoise venisaur for my friend Alana because it was her birthday and the other to my friend Jacob who is going to high school now so I can't see him anymore it's sad isn't it but hey I can see him when I'm in high school and on the bus.I'm grateful that my family and friends are so kind to me I want to be kind back although I broke a chromebook at schools which cost 400 dollars rounded up so I can sell my charazard and the stuffed animal beanie baby named Lizzy which is one of the rarest besides Leo the lion but Lizzy  is something I really like since my \textbf{old} neighbor gave it to me as a young kid she actually had five of them matter per fact she had all of the beanie baby's so ya she is rich in them but one of my many uncles has nearly every single magic card out there so ya he's practically rich because if he sells them all he would have around 1.5 million dollars you know how expensive the original prints of magic cards are he has 5 stacks that are around 6 feet tall each not only that he has the most powerful cards in the game he even gave me a few cards to make a basilisk deck and an artifact deck sure it's \textbf{old} fashioned but the greater basilisk card he gave me is pretty lethal with the death touch ability any amount of damage is enough to kill a monster he is also a defender so ya beware him\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}2/465 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.43 \\  \hline

I went through that annoying shit then when I was 11 and still have it when I'm 134: This smiling fuck doesn't even feel bad for stealing, disobediance, debt problems, or her fucking credit cards. Now in 2018 she must be still living with her mom, or hopefully a poor for that. 💸💳🔥3: Meh, she sounds like a \textbf{brat} and is a bit bossy, but I think the expense is more shocking. It's a 1st grader, save your money for the day they actually care. Well I knew more than most when I was in 1st, but that was the bratty stage. 😕2: This pisses me off the most... so skip if you don't want raged cursing and caps lock...You've chosen... wisely 🛐AARRGHH!! This whiny bitch gets mad at her parents, breaks off her W key and says her computer is broken, has at least 4 computers for only messaging, says she didn't break it, and then asks for donations from her viewers. What pisses me off the most about this is the fact that it took me a long while to get a laptop and I am still saving up for editing software, and she motherfucking complains about a popped off key, THEN EXPECTS THE VIEWS TO PAY FOR IT! 4 LAPTOPS FOR ONLY MESSAGING! THAT GETS ME DOWN TO THE BOILLING POINT!😠1: Oh won't pay for my college tuition, ok let me LEGALLY take your money by lying and suing you for "child abuse" like a fucking liberal jack-ass. (get it, democrats 😉) They brought her life, and she tries to take their hard earned money. My mom is very strict, but she still helps pay half my price for a car and promotes me to join the air force. She loves me, I love her. But that teen... She had no respect, no love, and no cosideration.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The last couple on the countdown definitely.2, because the fact that you got a phone should be good enough for you, much less 2 phones and 4 freaking MacBooks..........................This \textbf{brat} needs help.1, because that is anything BUT a requirement. I'm in a pit of despair because I do not have money for my own tuition; I'm relying on loans and financial aid! My mom would never help with any of my schooling; she might say she's proud of me, but considering she won't visit or come to watch my end of semester shows, I highly doubt it. She doesn't even call or text me, much less care that I succeed as a musician. Why would she pay for my tuition? Dad wouldn't have either. Parents are not "required " to pay for tuition anyway, because most kids are 18-19 when they graduate high school, which legally makes them adults. That means they fend for themselves. They wanna be independent; they need to understand that your parents don't have to pay for any of your college fees. If they make you a savings account, that's up to them. But it is not a requirement. Number 4 though...that is the one on Dr. Phil, yeah? She is made of pure evil.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I dont know if I agree with the example the judge was setting in that last case. Regardless of if the teen was telling the truth with the abuses or the parents were telling the truth about her being spoiled. The way the judge handled that if all judges handled things that way then abused kids are going to fall through the cracks constantly because that is a very \textbf{common} way abusive parents try to get out of legal trouble with being abusive towards their children. My mom was a severe alcoholic and extremly abusive to the point she even let her friends rape/molest me. Her first defense when I finally got a restraining order against her was I was being bratty and spoiled and was just trying to get my way. I was \textbf{nothing} of the sort. I was only ever scared and hurt. And now I have to live with \textbf{mental} illness and other issues for the rest of my life. It is especially difficult when ther eis often little or no hard evidence to give with these things. I am just saying things like these can't always be settled in the privacy of ones home where the potentially abusive parents hold all the real power. Sometimes the child needs outside help to resolve issues.

My sister basically gives him ANYTHING he wants. For example, she asks him what he wants to eat every day. He will either say PB\&J or ham sandwich. EVERY. STINKING. TIME. The rest of us could be having a great dinner, but he refuses to eat it and they don't make him sit and finish his food. Another huge thing at the dinner table, they even spoon feed him. Did I mention he's six years \textbf{old}?? He also gets everything he wants, WHEN he wants and if not.... well he screams at the top of his lungs, accusing the adult in charge that they are a liar and we don't love him.. yes, he plays that card. His parents have never spanked him or put him in time out in his life. I have other stories but I'll stop for now because it's just ridiculous.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Old & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!27}1/191 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.524 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small If any of my children ever tried to sue me bc I told them they're boyfriend or girlfriend was no good for them bc of the influence? First of all it would NEVER go that far! I say this bc for one, I wouldn't give my children the privilege of EVER thinking that they could EVER walk all over me like that! From the day they are born I would show them \textbf{nothing} but the love a daddy can give them. I raise them from day one wanting them to be stronger than me.( insane? NO! Because every parent I believe should raise they're children to be better than what they are. How do you think kingdoms raise they're next person to run the throne??) Me? I treat people like I want to be treated when I'm at my worst, and two? Well number 2 is have some FUCKING BALLS! You don't allow the life that YOU made to treat you like that! If your child feels that you 'owe' them and they're acting like that? Well to all you 'kids' out there...... Your in for a rude awaking bc life does not give a fuck who you are. When and where everyone gets what they get. Right/wrong place and right/wrong time! Take it from someone who's had everything and lost everything. Gained it again, and lost it again. Eventually you'll get it, or you'll die in your own self absorption. More than likely they'll be unexpected parent and they'll learn for themselves. For parents out there who actually wanted to be a parent. You have to take it one day at a time. Parenting is not easy. The best advice I can give anyone is to love your children. LOVE is the most powerful feeling that builds strength in numbers. When you love someone they will learn and realize that's what it takes. Not this shit. Sorry I'm ranting but one and only thing to bring a parent is to keep your family close. Keep it as close as you can. This life is once in a lifetime. Everyone in this world makes they're own decision. If I wanted my kid to treat me like that? Well I guess I would only blame yourself. My kids would think to treat me or anyone else like they 'deserve' better than them. You have a gift? Share that gift. Don't act like a spoiled little moron that make you show how pathetic you are in this life and that you could never live for yourself for 1 year by yourself. I'm not saying this to be a jerk. I am saying this because life is more than what keeps me entertained right now. I said take it one day at a time. The worst and the best can happen all in one day. Only YOU have that authority to make shit happen. So kids. Call me a \textbf{fag} or an asshole or  whatever! Your words or fists could never hurt me. I know what life is. I know that I can't control things. I do know that in my life that I see things like this and to the parents all I can say is, is that you have it easy. You can afford a lawyer to cover up for your shitty ass fucking parenting!  You wanna get it right? You know that feeling like somthing isn't right in life??  Well your already a tenth way there! You wanna know some real facts? Here's your answer. Love and never stop. That's the best you can do. You made a life and wanted to be treated like a slave?? Nah I'm good go ahead and do that shit!

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I am generally considered a spoiled child. At under the \textbf{age} of sixteen, I get straight A's and pretty much everything, even when I don't ask for it.

Seventeen?) year \textbf{old} girl who maxed out seventeen credit cards. Seventeen! And, to top it off, she sold priceless heirlooms. \textbf{Nobody} does that.Just know that not all spoiled kids are like this. Some, like my cousins and I, just really want a normal life instead of the ones handed to us on a silver platter.

Its a long story but is going like this: Two brats get in my car and are complaining back an fouth. They more or less ignore me and I get bits and pieces, from their conversation and get that the father of one had reduced the allowance of one of the girls. I then find out that "Daddy" has bought her a condo, a car, paid for her schooling and covers all of her bills. The allowance was her pocket money for whatever she wanted. At this point, I have to ask how was it reduced, She looks at me and says "like \$2000 a month". At this point in my life, I'm living off of about \$2500 a month. that surprised me! then I ask "How much was your monthly allowance" and my jar hit the floor when she said \$19,000.I I not so nicely said that the ride was going to be free, however, she had listened to what I had to say. I gave her a piece of my mind explaining that 2 grand would cover most of my living expenses and \$19,000 was an outrage allowance and how she was a spoiled \textbf{brat} that should try living like I do before complaining.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Brat & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}1/243 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.412 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small My hopes for these kids...5 - Those bratty kids get their asses whooped in Times Square where everyone can see their shame. Signs would be superglued to their foreheads that displayed their spoiled behaviors.4 - The girl would be excommunicated from her family, leaving her homeless and having to work to pay off her maxed out credit cards. Before she would be excommunicated though she would be tied to a chair and watch as all her belongings would be sold off by her boyfriend on eBay3 - This little girl would be forced to wear clothes made of trash at her next birthday party, all the tables would be made of termite infested wood, the flowers would be wilted, the cake would be made of mud and dirt, etc all to humiliate her and make her cry because that's what spoiled kids like her deserve.2 - The girl would be forced to use an \textbf{old} block phone, her MacBooks and phones would be smashed and she would be forced to watch them be broken. Then she would have to sell all her stuff in order to pay the total price for all her electronics that were broken.1 - the girl would be excommunicated from the family like 4, and she'd have to work to keep a home or be left out on the streets. She also wouldn't be allowed to go to college unless she paid for it, and it would be taken away and burned in front of her if she ever saved up enough.So I'm a bit of a sadist.

And the first one wasn't even spoiled, just bad parenting led to them being that way, and how many kids/teens here have never complained about wanting a dessert when they were younger? And even the teenagers were raised to be the way they are... The people who got sued by their child honestly didn't deserve any better...

The adults seemed like they thought it was cute and they are JERKS to raise their children like that.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Wow. I want all of those kids to die. Yes I k ow it is a sin, but these kids deserve to. And the parents, I cannot imagine the punishment God will give them. We just cannot spend our money. We have to use it wisely. Just because you have money does not mean that you can have everything and brag 21 hours a day. My family is not rich, and I feel that having money has a negative impact on society and family. I am a very intelligent person, and at 13 YEARS \textbf{OLD}, I have more experience in life than those kids who probably don't know how to fold clothing. My parents don't let me buy virtual things in games, and I'm fine with that. I don't want to spend all their hard earned money. I don't even have my own room. I can't even keep a phone, because my sister will 'accidentally' break it or it will just be destroyed. But these kids just take it too far. They buy ABSOLUTELY USELESS merchandise that is irrational to their way of living. Like, let's say you go to a gym, and instead of bringing water, Gatorade and all that stuff, u bring doughnuts, chocolate and a computer. I have seen a kid with Rolex watches on his wrists. And I said to him, why would you just spend your parents' money like that? You know that eventually you will run out and end up living on the streets, and no idea on how to survive because your butlers do everything for you. And you know what he said to me? He said that I am just a poor little thing with no money. And I said that at least I have a better cognitive function, I know 4 languages and I have a better understanding about life. And the best part was, he looked like he had NO idea of what I said. So I said that money does make a person more, hmmm simple minded. His parents and my parents were just staring, with lots of people around too, because we were at the mall, so the WHOLE time the kid was just staring at me with a IM GUNNA MERDER U face. When I asked for his \textbf{age},, he said he was 18 years \textbf{old}. I feel bad for them too, because they just don't understand many things. But at the same time I just want to drag his face down to the train station and to just drop him into the tracks, to be hit by the train. So please, appreciate the money you have, because one day you might lose everything, and you will have no idea of what to do. And all parents, teach them the skills necessary to regulatory life chores. Sure kids want things, but it is sad that a 13 year \textbf{old} boy has to tell this to the world, because others will not. I am a Salvadoran/Greek/British person, and I am proud of having tanned skin. And all these white Americans just assume I'm Mexican poor piece of shit, so I just, in the smartest way POSSIBLE, outsmart them and see who is the poor Mexican.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Pepsi Man Education is essential and what you do if your parent's don't provide you with money to study? You end up saving your own money over the years, leaving you at a disadvantage from other kids with parents who can afford it. I believe that healthcare and education should be provided by the government for free or small fees under regulation. The whole purpose of a government is to facilitate the things people would not do by themselves, but it is in everyone's interest. I beleive that your parent's have no obligations to you once you mature \textbf{old} enough, but you have an obligation to give back what you tookfrom your parent's effort and time to raise you right.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Old & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Over 65s & \cellcolor{green!5}1/120 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.833 \\  \hline

He's also super annoying and a big baby he said he might get another dog and I told him if he treats that dog like he does his one right now (Which will probably be worse care because there is two dogs and every fucking thing is handed to him on a silver platter) im going to try and get the dogs taken he also thinks he soooo cool and me and my friends always try to not be friends with the \textbf{brat} because that makes us look bad all of his friends are actually pretty nice and they finally came to their senses and told him to go fuck himself and they weren't friends (this happened on Xbox) he joined our party we said get out we don't wanna talk to you and he burst out crying saying "Why does no one like me!!!!" And my friend said "Because you are a spoiled rotten \textbf{brat} who gets handed everything he wants on a silver platter" and kicked him. He also lies he said he "Payed \$50,000 to get 2 iPhone X's early from \textbf{Apple}" we said prove it send a picture and he said "Oh they are in a safe that my dad only knows the code to keep them safe" Not to mention he smells like someone fucking dropped him in a big dumpster someone puked in and there is \textbf{black} all over his teeth. I stopped talking to him he tries to be friends with us but we just exclude him. So there is my story. Might I add that he brags. He went to dinner (On Xbox) once and said "Oh dinner I'm having going to this super nice restaurant for dinner" I muttered "Spoiled"Under my breath and he heard it (Not that I was trying to keep a secret that I said it) and he replied with "Oh what are you having for dinner" I said "Pasta" and he laughed and I just yelled "Fuck you asshole! I was never friends with you it was just because you had no friends and once I met you and realized you were a spoiled bitch I fucking faked it and hated you! Go fuck yourself you spoiled ass bitch! Fuck you go to hell!" And he said "Wha, wha... what? You never were?" And started sobbing which then turned into a cry and I yelled "Cry you fucker practice crying because I know it's going to happen when you don't get a Porsche for ur birthday fucker!"

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small This isn't really a spoilt \textbf{brat} story but it was quite annoying in my opinionA girl in my school (16 at the time) tried to convince me to have a movie and pizza evening every Friday and looking at it I tried to convince her to have store-bought snacks instead for which she called me cheap. This was the first dent in our communication and honestly, it got worse to the point that I avoided her at all times. Several months later her Dad's salary was cut severely and they had to sell their house and move to an apartment (An expensive apartment none the less) to pay for her sister's and her future University fees. Her credit card was inactive and she kept borrowing money from her friends or getting them to order her stuff online and pay by cash.She was rich and started crying about the whole thing in school to which I said "I have no idea how to comfort you, I'm sorry" and left the scene. At the time it felt like the universe was getting payback for me as she intentionally started to have me left out of our group of friends or trying to get me to ditch school activities to go to the movies for which I could get in big trouble. Let's just say my school life was isolated for the last year because her sister was Miss popular before she graduated giving this little miss the same popularity level. People who I thought were my friend were turned on me and if I did something wrong by accident and tried to apologise they never listened.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Brat & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}1/276 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.362 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I don't know if these kids were necessarily spoiled or not but they were clearly brats. My sister and were eating at a Boston Pizza last month and we were sitting in a booth. These two boys- around maybe nine or ten years \textbf{old}- are across from us, climbing up the back of a booth, running around and getting in the servers' way and actually going into the kitchen! Their parents were nowhere in sight and an older, bolder waitress actually told the kids they were not allow inside the kitchen and that their food was coming soon. My sister and I watched as a younger waitress just kind of manoeuvred around them but didn't say anything. I was shocked at the kids' behaviour and so was my sister. And we are not that \textbf{old}, we are both in our twenties but if our Mom and Dad had seen us doing that.... we'd be in so much trouble when we got home.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The 19-year-old \textbf{brat} at Number 4 (3:10) is just inexplicably inhuman; she uses 17 credit cards to buy things she doesn't even need (nearly 200 tones of lip gloss, 110 brushes, three cars with plans for a fourth.), and even goes so far to steal and sell her mother's jewerly: she smiles when she explains they were priceless to her mother as if it were funny, despite the fact that she's \$26K in debt.  Then there's what I heard from 8:10 about how one girl needs four laptops to send, receive, block, and reply to messages: I call bullshit because the reason why her parents are financially struggling is because of her other three laptops which she doesn't even need.  I use only one laptop for everything when she "needs" four just to do one task for each of them. In fact, I work 8 hours a day 5 days a week for a \$300 weekly paycheck with a portion of that going into bills for the house my parents and I share.  My message to all of the rich brats out there is that you need to grow up and take responsibility for yourselves, because the adult world will not tolerate pointless needs such as a laptop for each tasks, nor \$32,000 birthday parties.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Well when I was in elementary I remember this little girl who use to anger teachers. She was a gossip to everyone including the teachers about stuff including the conversation of other teachers, with telling about the complaints of one unpopular teacher (with the students she liked to yell a lot) she heard say that she was going to quit her job and try to apply to some place. She never really bothered me and my friends but most of the teachers thought that she was a entitled \textbf{brat} because if she got in trouble over something or had to be stop from getting into it with another student she was mad at, she would complain and whine about how she was right and. It in the wrong. This had gotten so bad that I remember two teachers downright telling her in front of the entire class that she was a selfish \textbf{brat} on two separate occasions who needed to learn respect for others. The first one this happen she was in the first grade and the second time in the fifth grade.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Brat & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!5}2/183 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.093 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small My father. Though my family wasn't rich, just enough, he treated it like it was. Before I was born he would spend the money carelessly, buying cars that he wanted and when he had me, my grandparents paid for everything because they could "afford it". biggest mistake because it made him even more reliant on them and because of that he believes they have money when there really isn't. He never paid for my tuition, for things we needed. He didn't finish college (skipped classes) and only got a job when my grandparents were struggling and even then he barely paid for anything. My aunt, his sister, and my grandmother practically raised me.   My mother separated from him. Both are unreliable parents. Throughout my entire childhood my dad acted like it was a privelege to be his child. Now, as the eldest and with my younger sister, we both turned our backs on him for being an asshole. We don't like helping him and we made it clear we wanted \textbf{nothing} to do with him. Graduation? grandma and aunt went with me on stage. Every milestone I went through in life it was them I asked to be accompanied with, not him. My mother didn't deserve it either for other reasons. He was a \textbf{brat} in an adult's body, he had gone through tantrums that he should have outgrown long ago and bitched on how life was unfair and how his kids were ungrateful. I was 12 when I told him I would accomplish the things he didn't do and prove to him how wrong he was about everything. I prioritized my schooling, made real friends that liked me for me, graduated college, found a job and met someone. No relationship is perfect but we compromise and trust each other, something my dad doesn't believe in that's why he's had so many failed relationships. We're happy. I know he's got his own issues and sometimes I feel sorry when I see him sad that he wasn't part of but what we had, he ruined it. His own children never told him he was loved. I don't remember when I ever did, so did my sister and that is very sad. Now we have another sibling and me and my sister refuse to financially help when both parents were alive and still young. We weren't going to give him the opportunity to go revert back to his shitty parenting and all but forced him to get his ass working again. To be responsible. He ruined his relationship with us but he could start fresh with our youngest. People can still change and while its too late with us at least he's being a decent parent. He's outgrown the \textbf{brat} persona but he still needs work as a person.But still, I dealt 18 years of his bullshit. Took some tough loving (and I say love very loosely) and karma being a bitch but it worked out alright. And no, 22 now and still don't like being around him.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Brat, Nothing & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters & \cellcolor{green!27}3/507 & \cellcolor{green!27}0.592 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small the girl with the \$32,000 party is just enjoying to the fullest what is GIVEN which I am not saying is right.  Now, if the list was about the worst parents this one probably falls at the top as I said the one with the resturaunt is well its not smart, they probably behaved the same earlier and now they GET positive REINFORCEMENT.  The Dr. Phil one seems to be explaining it like a past she isn't proud of although I don't think she has well been fixed of all the \textbf{mental} damage.  She isn't remorseful for stealing from her parents although she might be placing some of the blame on her parents for doing things that way.  But maybe she never heard 2 wrongs don't make a right...well it does in math in negatives to positives but in reality of people and choices it equals FAIL.  Now the video of the girl begging for a NEW laptop or money to fix that one...well she seems...normal...which is kinda scary.  Her fight was over her POOR parents buying her the EXPENSIVE phone and getting the WRONG casing which she DON'T like so she gets MAD for it and breaks her own laptop.  now she is BEGGING the WEB for a NEW LAPTOP and for MONEY to be sent to her FROM STRANGERS.  The bass of the received if she received money well...I have some doubts as if this is a good idea.  It was suggested after I was hit that because the \textbf{woman} could not be sued I create a internet video and RAISE money for surguries that may or may not work.  I don't know what bass would have responded and felt it wasn't a good idea in the end.  The last one I think there might have been valid points for concern and I feel we just don't have the FULL story.  If the parents have her at HOME they probably feel that something is OWED to the girl.  In fact the courts even pointed it out, and the implication is mistakes were made.  So is she a diva?  I am afraid we don't know.  But then you remember the girl with the laptops and realize that there is a goal to allow her to have her way as much as possible after all in financial bankruptcy they are buying her a phone and for some reason no consequences are in operation for a spoiled act over her birthday present.  She doesn't understand clearly because the understanding of moral behavior hasn't been introduced so this is the effect that makes that segment sad and depressing.  The first ones well the parents clearly had a hand in it, but the worst you have to REALIZE is when its SAID and DONE for it where are you?  Apart of helping yourself is to realize you had a part in whatever it was.  So now shes selling her mistake on air on Dr. Phil for 15 minutes of fame.  There it is your prized hen although the girl with the 4 LT's and one broken the unnamed parents have climbed the meter if we were rating the parents involvement.  To not teach them manners and to spoil them rotten in a way so the KID who feels this behavior is NORMAL AND OKAY is NOT OKAY is an after thought.  Especially when there facing bankruptcy.  But the girl is less hurt about the idea of possibly losing her bedroom that a busted laptop 1 of 4...and lacks full understanding as I said.  UPDATE:  I just kind of thought I probably am due for a list of people doubting me and saying its not good.  And I never said it was on the kids part.  But she confidently BELIEVES she did no wrong and yeah there probably is a issue of anger there after all she was angry enough to cosmetically damage her own Laptop.  Me, I am multi-tasking and gaming and doing youtube like this man clearly is with 1 computer and not 1 for SEND, 1 for RECEIVING, etc.  LOL.  Anyway, before the parents can hope to get anywhere the parents would have to deal with whatever issue of anger.  The fact is you never know there might be a underlying understandable issue for the anger...which if there is it often doesn't fade but the individual has to learn with it to HELP themselves which also can take time.  The video doesn't list it.  But I wanted to clear the air so I didn't receive a list of people replying saying shes got to be the worst thing on this earth and I am \textbf{blind}.

I removed him from skype but he knew my number so he called me and apologized (LOL, how can i forgive you for that? dipshit). I said i wouldn't forgive him because he is selfish as hell.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I had a friend named Alex who was a preppy little prick that I liked for some reason. We were good friends for many years until he became a self entitled asshole, well, more of a self entitled asshole. His parents ended up moving him from my elementary school to a "school for the gifted"😒. His parents where okay but they spoiled him rotten. They would buy him every single new lego set that had come out the entire year for Christmas and would pay for every set to be shipped to his grandparents house in Florida just so he could open them, they would then mail them back to their house in a completely different state. They went to Florida every year too. He had a Wii and got every single lego game. Did I mention he loved Lego. He also loved star wars and got all the plastic lightsabers. What really broke our friendship though was one time I was over when we were having a lightsaber fight in the backyard, he picked up this tuff cracked dry rot rubber dog toy and threw it square at my face. It gave me a bloody nose and a \textbf{black} eye that came the next day. It hurt like hell and when I told him, he said it didn't hurt and to stop saying it did. I picked it up, threw it as hard as possible at his stomach and beat him with the lightsaber, left, and never went back. Surprisingly, I never got his parent's knocking at the door scolding me. I think it's because he knew he fcked up and they would of seen my face.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small my sister I think is most spoiled. it was christmas and keep in mind my family is VERY poor so we can't buy alot of stuff so this Christmas was amazing because my mom managed to buy tons of gifts for us with so little money. anyways we were opening gifts and here's some of the things she got stuff like emoji slippers and legit a movie player. my other sister got a doll house that was actually free because the doll house was actually mine so yea and a new pair of shoes. I got a new pair of shoes and alot of fnaf stuff. so after we were done opening gifts she starts to complain about how she didn't get any converse and she went on about how she should of had converse and it's like you got a DVD player and have never had a Christmas like this so shut your mouth. that wasn't the only time we caught her being a \textbf{b*tch} either. she got a smaller Easter basket than her sister so she started to complain about how small it was. I was about to scream at her saying I only got shorts and a shirt so she can shut it but I'm not aloud to yell at her. ok last story this is actually a problem that happens along with alot of kids so yea. when she goes to her  real mom not her step mom aka my mom she doesn't get attention because she has to always take care of her little sister but one day she said I have a sticker and wasn't crying and when no one was paying attention she started to cry and me being the person I am was like well guess what my brother was in a car crash so shut it.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I have a \textbf{brat} story. A few weeks ago I was in Florida with my family for vacation. One day my uncle Mike brought me and my younger cousins, Henry and Camille to an outlet mall. He brought them to a Disney store, and they each got a toy. Camille got a repunzel doll and Henry got a Spiderman toy. The next day my whole family went to the outlet mall. Papa, my grandfather brought Camille to a store and bought her a twenty five dollar necklace. Meanwhile, uncle mike brought Henry to the Disney store again and he got another spiderman toy. When we got back in the car and Camille saw Henry's new toy, she started pitching a fit because she didn't know she could get another toy from the Disney store. So she cried and cried and cried... and cried... and cried... (oh and did I mention she CRIED?) for like twenty minutes even though papa bought her a twenty five dollar necklace. Not to mention she kept screaming to go to the Disney store for ANOTHER toy, even though she already had a twenty or thirty something dollar repunzel doll. Then when we went to five guys to eat, Henry pitched a fit because he didn't want burgers, so uncle Mike literally brought Henry next door to Marco's pizza and bought a whole pizza. I swear, \textbf{nothing} makes me more angry than a spoiled rotten little \textbf{brat}.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small I knew a kid once who asked for an Xbox 360 for christmas, but his family was kind of in a financial shit hole at the time so all they could afford was a Nintendo DS. They got it for him, he promptly snapped it in half, threw it onto the floor and screamed "THAT'S NOT WHAT I FUCKING ASKED FOR!" (He's like eight years \textbf{old} at this time, by the way)He was also caught at about the same time watching adult programs on TV, all of which were bought with his parents credit card (which he somehow got hold of). I guess his grandfather had been babysitting him the day earlier and had forgotten to turn parental settings back on after watching something that required it to be off, probably HBO or something. When his parents found him watching the adult programs, they turned the TV off and tried to send him to his room but he just punched and kicked and screamed until he eventually got up and walked in by himself.The kid hogged the electronics he could all the time, and was a complete attention whore. He was misbehaved like \textbf{nothing} you've ever seen, and I only know him because of a Sunday dinner group I used to go to when I was younger. I was the only other "kid" there (I was thirteen or fourteen at the time) so he needed to be around me fucking CONSTANTLY, meaning I caught the majority, and the brunt of his antics. And everybody else at the group knew it too. I'm talking all adults, ranging from late 20's to mid to late 60's at a religious Sunday dinner party calling this kid the anti-christ when he wasn't around to hear it. The kid had \textbf{nothing} to do with religion (then again, I didn't really either, but at least I was showing interest in being converted) and was a complete spoiled rotten \textbf{brat}. He actually is the main reason I stopped going to those parties, even though I hear that he has stopped going. I did go again at one point after he stopped showing up, but since my day had already turned out shitty, I had predicted that he would show up again. My parents reassured me that the kid hadn't been there all summer since he had hockey practice on Sundays. So, I believed them, and went. Turns out, that was the only day that summer he showed up! It's funny how I seem to be a master at predicting these things. (I think I will turn this power to good use! If this comment gets over 1000 likes by the end of July 2017, North Korea will be obliterated in August 2017 before they can cause further damage to the rest of the world.)Eventually, I guess, he was taken away from his parents after inadequate care. I don't really know the details but he then moved in with his aunt, who then lost her home. He now either lives in a foster home or in a shelter since the people his aunt lives with now couldn't stand him enough to let him live with them.

I finally cracked and took away the legos she had and she started screaming and started hitting me until she went outside to our indoor balcony from the stairs.

She would choose those lipsticks because she is the type of person THAT JUST DOESN'T CARE AT ALL KEYWORD---->AT ALL<---- ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE AROUND HER AND THE LENGTHS THEY WOULD GO TO, TO DO THINGS FOR HER.

The s6 and s6+ don't have much of a difference, the only differences are the s6+ is bigger than s6 and maybe has a bigger battery and a better processor. This \textbf{brat} is that spoiled because she gets mad that she got the wrong phone which is slightly different to the one she wanted. There was no need for her to get super mad about the wrong phone and for her making this shitty video of her asking for money to fix or replace her MacBook when that's pointless because SHE HAS 3 OTHER MACBOOKS. She can multitask with one MacBook. I have one laptop for everything from messaging to sending messages and gaming AT THE SAME TIME. This ugly \textbf{brat} is just useless in society and everything and probably can't get a job.

Well she's getting kicked out soon, she's in year 11 for gods sakes and she's the laziest and ugliest \textbf{bum} ever. I bet when She gets kicked out she'll talk about how much she did for my mum, like baby sitting HER OWN FUCKING LITTLE SISTER for \$30 an hour. I have to baby sit my little sister now because my mum didn't have the cash to pay my sister one night. I literally have to give money out of my own wallet to pay for her shit. I went from \$300 from saved up money to \$50. Whatever I'm happy my rich auntie gave me \$100 for games and shit and I got far cry 4 and a great mouse. My sister got \$100 for clothes and she said THIS ISNT ENOUGH and stormed off. She probably wanted \$1000- \$5000 from her. Even if my auntie didn't have over 30 million she would still say that, you know why. Because she's a spoiled \textbf{brat} and she's not part of the family.And my mum still loves her and does everything for her.And my mum asks me if it's her fault and she legit doesn't think it's her fault that my sister is spoiled.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Brat, Bum & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - Youngsters, Social Class - Destitute & \cellcolor{green!5}3/437 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.686 \\  \hline

This \textbf{brat} is that spoiled because she gets mad that she got the wrong phone which is slightly different to the one she wanted. There was no need for her to get super mad about the wrong phone and for her making this shitty video of her asking for money to fix or replace her MacBook when that's pointless because SHE HAS 3 OTHER MACBOOKS. She can multitask with one MacBook. I have one laptop for everything from messaging to sending messages and gaming AT THE SAME TIME. This ugly \textbf{brat} is just useless in society and everything and probably can't get a job.
