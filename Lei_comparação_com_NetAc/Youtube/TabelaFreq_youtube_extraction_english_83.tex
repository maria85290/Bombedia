  \cellcolor{green!5}\small KasumiKrissOut of curiosity, are you basing this perspective on your religious beliefs or are your views secular?  Part of the the problem is that women aren't actually generally as \textbf{promiscuous} as you are assuming.  It only looks that way because it is what is shown in pornography and movies/tv.  Also, you say that women are more emotional but that isn't really true.  It's just more socially frowned upon for men to show their emotions.  Plus, men often are even more emotional than women in many cases.  For example, it's usually men who get more violent and angry when rejected by the opposite \textbf{sex}.  Men also tend to be the ones who resort to wars.  The other problem is that most of the studies you are talking about that show that women who have more \textbf{sexual} partners are less happy in marriage are conducted by religious people who have bias against women having \textbf{sexual} freedom.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Promiscuous, Sex, Sexual & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - Female sexuality, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}4/155 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.581 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small What a close-minded submissive \textbf{woman}... Wow. Girl if you feel less than men, fine. But don't come here with all those stereotypes pretending to be some guru that will enlighten people. And for your information, you have completely misunderstood feminisim. It is not against men, we don't ask for more, we ask for equal rights because we are \textbf{nothing} less and \textbf{nothing} more. In other words it is not against men, it is against women like YOU who are the ones to blame why women were treated like objects with centuries, not men. 'WHAT YOU GIVE POWER TO, HAS POWER OVER YOU.'  And if you think that men are smarter and more ambitious then try analyzing kids at school and see who is better and more ambitious to get good grades in general. Girl, I am more ambitious and have a better career than most of the men I am surrounded with. If you are lazy, okay, I understand, but luckily not all women are girls like you, many are REAL GROWN-UP WOMEN, something you don't know about. And yes I always thought so and you are a living proof, women without self-love and self-respect who feel less are the reason why women were in a bad position for so long and why feminism started at a first place. And I hope YouTube will stop suggesting me your funny videos who never fail to make me hit the roof. W O W and btw housewife is not a real job if it is then quit 'working' as one for a month and you will see what your home will look like. That won't happen in any real working environment because they will replace you asap. Home is a responsibility of the people who live there, not a job. Which is different, but if you are lazy and wanna call it a job to feel that you are actually working something, go ahead! Let's see what will happen if someday you break up with your bf/husband (who seems like he has adopted a lazy teenage daughter instead of a mature partner) , you will then go to 'work' in your parents house and be a housewife there so they will support your lazy ass, don't you? As for \textbf{sex}, stop putting your nose in other's people private lives no matter if they are women or men, you are \textbf{nothing} but a submissive \textbf{woman} with a closed mind who does \textbf{nothing} but talk about stereotypes convincing herself that she is a guru(in bashing women) that will brain wash all of us. Some women do not deserve to be called as such, you are indeed one of them. Look at the comments below your videos and you will see only men bashing women just like you do. Congrats for that, I guess that's your goal üëèREAL PEOPLE OF VALUE WHO VALUE HUMANS ARE FEMINISTS BECAUSE FEMINISM IS ABOUT EQUALITY NOT BASHING ONE OR THE OTHER. There are so many men who understand this wayyy better than you, real men are feminists. And so are real women, but you know \textbf{nothing} about that I guess. You put everything on scale and do \textbf{nothing} but comparing people. Oh and the world is not only made of straight people, you seem to forget about that while bashing women with all those stereotypes, but yet again, I am not surprised that you do.

I've been with my partner for 6 years and we had \textbf{sex} the first night we met.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Too many generalizations in this video. The generalization that women sleeping around don't have long lasting relationships is bogus. Everyone is different and everyone's situation turns out different. Sometimes sitting around being the "good girl" can still land you in an unfulfilled relationship, getting cheated on, etc. A failing relationship has many factors; some big ones are incompatibility, rushing into marriage(because you have to be married to be fulfilled in life, apparently), unfaithfulness from either party, and my personal favorite, people upholding this fairytale image of marriage that is far from the truth and the reality is not what they expect at all. Also childhood traumas and other unhealed parts of ourselves, which means one or both of them being mentally and emotionally unhealthy people getting into relationships when they should be working on themselves to become healthy, whole people first.And there is a huge gap in the reasoning that men are made and are supposed to sleep around and women aren't. If men are "allowed" to sleep around and are doing so, they are likely sleeping around with women, right?. Therefore they are adding to the list of \textbf{promiscuous} women and then turn around complaining that there are too many \textbf{promiscuous} women. So either it's acceptable for everyone to sleep around or no one does and everyone should wait. Quite a lot of men here talk about \textbf{promiscuous} women not being able to settle with one man as if most men are being super faithful after having their fun beforehand. I'm personally not a fan of sleeping around by men or women because I feel people should respect themselves to find a quality partner. That is your most vulnerable state and an energy exchange happens so if you don't know who you're dealing with you'll be taking on their shit. It's best to always find a trusted \textbf{sex} partnerNot everyone wants a relationship or has that as their end goal, and marriage is a social construct. There was a time when marriage had \textbf{nothing} to do with love! It was designed as a transaction between the families for resources and wealth. Marriage as we know it is a rather recent concept, even monogamy wasn't always the norm. People should do what works for them cause we are all wired differently.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Ask yourself....outside of a loving committed relationship why does someone desire a \textbf{sexual} encounter?  Seems to me it is basically falls into 2 areas.  The first is the power or control aspect.  It's having the perception that I can get this person to do what I want.  The 2nd is the fase narrative that \textbf{sex} is a form of validation and approval.  I heard it said that when someone wants to have \textbf{sex} with you it is perceived as the "ultimate approval".  So someone with low self esteem or perhaps a false sense of self feels that they need this perceived approval and validation to feel whole or good enough.  In both cases, the low self esteem and empty self drives people to have \textbf{promiscuous} \textbf{sexual} encounters over and over.  It never fills the empty void but they keep trying to get the illusionary result through this "fix".

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small As a man, whom has not been successful in most relationships and has not had \textbf{sex} with anyone before, I'd give up a city of gold to have a \textbf{woman} whom has never taken the seed of another man, and whom will stay loyal to me. I know I don't deserve that, though, because I look up porn and masterbate to it all the time. The reason why girls go out and have \textbf{sex} with multiple partners is because they are attracted to behaviors and attitudes that few men have, and when women find a men whom turns them on, it's a rare find for them, and it's much harder for them to pass it up. On the other hand, there are few men whom know game good enough to get a steady stream of women into their beds, and men whom are good with women don't really need to stay with one partner, so when the greatest victory men experience is having women submit to him and have \textbf{sex} with them, why would he be loyal? Especially when women reward him and find him even more attractive for having had \textbf{sex} with multiple women. Women generally have a submissive nature toward whom she is attracted to (wants to be conquered), while men build their confidence and manliness upon getting what they want - \textbf{sex} and women, LOTS OF \textbf{SEX} AND WOMEN, so dominant and masculine men get the girls, while more gentle natured or less confident men end up looking up porn, masturbating or abstaining until marriage. I'll be honest, I could have a \textbf{woman} whom has had \textbf{sex} before (especially since I'm spraying my seed all over), it's just I don't want her to choose and prefer the other men over me. Even if she has DNA of other guys in her, I'd still want my DNA to be the strongest and be the most desirable to her. My roommate has a girlfriend right now whom was married to an abusive husband, and she implies very strongly that she prefers the turn on of dominant abuse compared to the gentle and compliant nature of my roommate. Being in a relationship like that would depress most men and strip them of confidence and manliness. The strength of men comes from women, for what is a man without a \textbf{woman} and family? Women aren't less as human beings, nor are they less in importance, but they are inferior in authority of men. Even so, women should never underestimate their effect on men.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small it's already too late for a lot of women because they refuse to have anti-feminist marches in opposition and shut down the degenerate feminists. They are the only ones that can do it now. The laws and media are such that men will get shut down before they can really do anything. Women need to fight to deplatform feminists at every turn. Throw in a few pro men marches and fight to end the current system that sticks it's nose in the marriage and maybe men will be able to slowly put faith back in women. Also if women think them sleeping around is okay and then expect a husband they are dead wrong. If you are sleeping around then what makes you more valuable to a man than a prostitute? You show that you have no value in your body, have insecurity, and aren't very good at planning ahead.

That's why men do it, it's biology, we don't do it just because.....They ran the same thing on women and the amount of partners had \textbf{zero} effect on their long term happiness. They just do it just to do it, I guess. Women aren't \textbf{dumb} but the societal norms we have today are. Another thing that proves this is, women are supposed to think things through before \textbf{sex}. Men are suppose to have the discipline in everything else and women are supposed to learn to have discipline when it comes to \textbf{sex}.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Firstly, women care about the quality of the relationship more than the quantity of partners, but it's hard to have a good quality relationship, because the psyche is complicated, as a result, a \textbf{woman}  may end up having many relationships until she can find the right guy who will fit well with her personality, and know how to please her sexually and satisfy her emotional needs, and it's her right, and shouldn't be shamed for having many relationships, also it's very small possibility to find the right partner for you from the first try.Secondly, you say that " when it came to women the amount of partners didn't have effect on their long term happiness " because most likely those partners didn't know how to please them sexually, it's more complicated to please a \textbf{woman} than to please a man, men mostly think about pleasing themselves, you say "men need to have discipline in everything but \textbf{sex} while women need to have discipline in \textbf{sex}" I disagree, why throw responsibility on women when it comes to \textbf{sex} and avoid your own responsibility when you are participating in it?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Sweetie, don't you think it's sexist to allow men to sleep with as many women as they want and expect women to be celibate? I don't care how different men and women are, having a set of moral standards for one \textbf{sex} and another set for the other is oppressive. Think about women who already realized they won't find the man they deserve. Do they not have the right to have \textbf{sex}? Shall they be virgins forever? And if they are divorced and can't find good men, shall they give up the pleasure of \textbf{sex} for the rest of their lives?  Another problem stemming from this oppression of women:  in countries where women are raised believing it is shameful for women to have \textbf{sex} outside of marriage, men complain that their wives are terrible in bed. Then they go to other women, mostly foreign women, who will do those things their wives won't do. A \textbf{woman} just can't win. If she is experienced in bed and likes \textbf{sex} she is a whore. If otoh she doesn't like \textbf{sex} much or lacks the experience to please a man (for no fault of her own, mind you), she is deemed frigid or bad in bed.

As for the man whore vs women whore statement I have to agree. Both men and women should be looked at equally based on their body count but unfortunately that's not the way society looks at it. Most male and females have respect for a male who can get with many women ONLY because it's more difficult to get with women compared to women getting with men and can you really blame them?

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small The last thing a man wants to marry is a nun.  Nuns aren't \textbf{promiscuous}, don't sleep around.   So...no your theory is wrong IMHO.Opening the door to \textbf{sex} should be taken seriously by the \textbf{woman} and the womans job is make the man prove that he is worthy.   How does a man prove he is worthy, he communicates it and then over time (a number of dates that share truthful conversations) his actions match his talk.   The womans job is to be discerning and question him on his past relationships.  If he claims to have none, its a \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} flag, if he claims his last relationship lasted a short time (\textbf{r\textbf{ed}} flag), if he refuses to talk details about why they broke up (\textbf{r\textbf{ed}} flag).  No actual names (\textbf{r\textbf{ed}} flag).  Hides his phone when it rings (\textbf{r\textbf{ed}} flag).A man cannot discuss his past without slipping up eventually, but a \textbf{woman} knows if she asks about it, the date may be over and she wont ask so she can say later, he's a pig, he only wanted one thing,  etc..    I don't care how many relationships the \textbf{woman} has had, I can tell by her stories and her answers to my questions what her nature is, i can tell by her home, her grooming, her achievements, etc.  If she takes good care of herself, and kids, or others,  but if she has had lots of relationships it only tells me she favors being very social and likes to flirt, but that doesn't make her a nun and it doesn't make me think she is unworthy.   She may appear a bit more 'easy' but then if she is regal she will not hesitate to put the wolfish men in their place and abandon them.   As far as relationships go...  I always told my daughters its far better to be on your own than take a guy who doesn't reciprocate your efforts towards them.  Relationships must be balanced to last. There are too many guys that take and take and they are not worth any investment.   It always ends in feelings of low self esteem (why didn't he love me, am i not worthy of love, etc.) when it should have never started (because all the signs were there, your friends told you not to date him and you refused to simply question him without getting evasions for answers).  The most attractive thing going for a \textbf{woman} is the fact she is at peace and doesn't need me (has hobbies, friends to hang out with, likes to read and takes time instead of rushing around).  I want to come home to peace.  If she is constantly feeling anxious and needy, its a major turn off, just FYI. I'll bet the women feel the same way.  They dont want an angry man, a petulant child waiting to be served and worshiped, they want a man who takes care of business and is calm, and when he gets her things she mentions wanting (she knows she is cared for).Relationships are like a couple dancing together.  The longer the it goes on the more it is meshes.  The wife and husband cannot be understood often and if you listen to what the wife or husband says and witness the answer or actions of the other it doesn't make sense, but the husband knows what the wife meant to say, and the wife knows the meaning of the husbands actions and words and they are as one mind.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Promiscuous, Red, Sex, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Ethnicity - Native-American, Gender - Female sexuality, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}16/583 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.744 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small I think the internet is an echo chamber. Most people that are experiencing bad things in their life tend to post more online. People that enjoy their life tend to not post things on the internet (reddit, forums, etc). There's so much negative shit on the internet and perhaps it's because of negativity bias. All the men on the MGTOW, \textbf{R\textbf{ed}} Pill, Incel stuff, many of the posts I see are very negative. I always question, who are the people posting behind the keyboard. Are they truly credible? Do they have their shit together in life, do they clean their own room? Or is it just people who go outside infrequently?When it comes to Amazon, more people are likely to post a negative review if something bad happens as opposed to a positive review. More people post bad shit about their lives or viewpoints than the good cause people enjoying their lives aren't on the internet posting things as frequently. Anyone can easily bias themselves on anything with selective information bias. It's an issue with the current \textbf{age} we live in where there is complete accessibility of all sorts of info through the internet. If you think women are horrible, you can google hundreds of posts about it. If you think men are horrible, you can google all sorts of post on the worst of men. All reinforcing the bias one may already have. If you're consuming content or information the worst of women or the worst of men on a consistent basis than it skews perception. In normal day to day life, people are chill and cool. I don't get all these skewed perceptions of reality people ascribe too.

Bye! And hear the words: You don't own me, go away.And Next thing you find out is. That she has been going out with another guy that is wealthy or in a better financial situation. Your \textbf{gender} more and more feels their presence in a relationship is a paid one \$\$\$. Marriage is a profit organised situation for your \textbf{gender}. So, Instead of those finals she said she was studying for. And she runs with him. After I have been paitiantly waiting for as long as it's been. So, it appears as if the only thing I want is \textbf{sex} with you. But, NO!What it is, is that getting involved with your \textbf{gender} is a high risk endeavor.There is no way for me to anticipate what your intentions are. For me to invest time \& money. See, your \textbf{gender} is seen out there doing all kinds of things. And, I mean ALL KINDS OF THINGS. OK!Things that my jaw has touched the floor on several occasions.So, if a girl with 100 integrity, love, empathy, non \textbf{promiscuous}, normality, regularity, self regulating, accountable, responsible, non hypermist, feminine, respectful, lives within means, cooks, cleans, shows up. It's 1 in a trillion. It becomes, hard or impossible to believe. There are no unicorns \& or gold crickets telling you wisdom to your ears anymore. So, its become a catch 22. And your \textbf{gender} along with the feminists have taken it all the way there. To a very complicate deal. Even to start.Your \textbf{gender} has overpriced themselfs out of the market.The so called therapy for couples is corrupt. Men loose that time after time. On the other hand the expectation of divorce is really high. And 75 of all divorces are iniciated by your \textbf{gender}, not men.  Family court is the destruction of any man. Men suicide is at 80Do you see some of the picture?So, yes men nowdays. Run with what they can. And they run. But now, even that is ending. With the false rape accusations.

Ever thought, that maybe being with    the same person, kissing the same person and having \textbf{sex} with the same person can be boring. In beginning, it is exciting  because you guys have alot of expectations and so the attraction seems like it  high.  After awhile once you guys get used  to one another, the attraction gradually starts to   diminish.   Then you  have to  constantly work hard to keep the attraction  and relationship going.  Attraction isn't something that  is permanent. You can love  someone and not be attracted to them.  Now if  you see yourself trying hard to forcibly  try to spice up your relationship or  try to forcibly make a relationship work, then that means that  your relationship is  boring and you are starting lose the attraction that you guys once had.  Why you think people tend to say, that we were once happy , what happened. What happened was you guys loved the idea  of a   one another. You never loved the person, you loved what you expected of that person to do for you, to make you feel good about yourself.  And that's what alot of people fail to realize is that if you only love someone because  of  what thet do  and give you to  make you  feel special and happy. Then what happens if they stop providing what you  are looking for, are you going to break up and resent them. If you do then it makes your love very conditional and it also makes you  narcissistic.  Because all you care about is wanting to feel special and you are addicted to that.  That's what makes people think  that they're  in love with someone, when in reality you're simply attached and addicted to how they make you feel. That's a form of narcasstism.

In ones 20s people experience their lives and figure themselves out, they're getting out of university, finding jobs, making sense of dating and seeking pleasure. This is all a very healthy and normal life, any \textbf{old} person will encourage you to make the most of it. It's understandable to me that when you're in that growth period you're not going to 100percent chance upon the person you want to marry from the get go, in fact you're going to go through many trials and errors and even lose your momentum along the way and even your faith. I think we need to be realistic and educated when talking about these matters than villanising people who are only starting their adult lives out from their 20s.The comments demeaning women are motivated by envy through rejection. Dr Jordan Peterson talks quite clearly about how female natural selection (rejection and choosing a \textbf{sexual} partner) can deeply hurt a man's psyche. Shaming is a tactic used to possess those very women into submission. Women are becoming more selective and careful with settling down, that's the hard science of it. My parents in their day, finding marriage was a cultural pressure regardless. Now days most of us are well educated, we consider the decisions we make and so it naturally follows we will be more discriminatory with who we choose and if we are even ready. I haven't looked at many people and felt they were going to make good parents or partners to each other, so that says something, the divorce rates affirm this too.

We know this because some one night flings turn into marriage and others are just one off experiences where the \textbf{woman} choose to move on to the next. Any interaction with the opposite \textbf{sex} (or same \textbf{sex}) plays a very real role in contributing to our natural selection mechanism. You're falling short on realising that intention to select doesn't equate to selection always.Our natural biology instructs us to test our options even without our awareness of what it is we are doing, perhaps it is merely the product of what we do that we come to an end in finding someone to settle down with or we stop knowing its time to be intentional and that can be but not always that we reduce our sleeping behaviours, some people are hyper testers whether they intend it or not ie fuck boys, "sluts"...

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@humanityandme I am primarily a mathematician in training so what I do is I always look at science. But, I think that you are missing a very important point here. You are assuming that the majority of men and women nowadays act \textbf{promiscuous} because of purely evolutionary reasons. However, the majority of people will never sit on a bench and reflect upon their inner biological workings and come to the conclusion that "the reason why I sleep around is because I try to select this ideal partner". They do it because of indoctrination and that is what society dictates us to do. The women I've casually slept with always argumented something along the lines "I currently just want to have fun and \textbf{nothing} serious". It is a choice that they made. I've also had encounters where they would get attached to me or have some feelings in the primitive stage and they would then end the casual relationship because of their choice of not wanting anything serious at that time.I simply cannot see how \textbf{sex} is helping you determine your life partner. What do you gain from sleeping around with multiple people? How does that help you select your ideal partner?I at one point slept with three women in a casual relationship rotation. All three of them are out of my life at this point. I can tell you that I have gained \textbf{nothing} in terms of selecting my partner to settle down. I am precisely at the same point where I was when I only had \textbf{sex} with one \textbf{woman} in my first relationship.I can only tell you that with one \textbf{woman} I connected better, but that I could have told you without sleeping with her.

If you're sleeping with people who don't want something serious then it's your responsibility to not engage, no one is holding a gun to your head and forcing you to engage, you are free to seek out women who fit your criteria elsewhere but nonetheless I stand by what I said in that women are choosing who they want to sleep with but you are changing the goal post on bringing in a different topic imposing that a \textbf{woman} should stop sleeping around because that is wasting her time in settling down, my assertion here is that this is simply the reality, people are human and a whole lot of them are practicing their right to \textbf{sexual} engagement with anyone they please and we can not sit around here telling them to stop because our egos are bruised.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nothing, Sex, Sexual, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Youngsters, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}4/250 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.6 \\  \hline

They do not end in marriage.Do you have any books or scientific articles to provide for you saying that in ones 20s it is natural to be \textbf{promiscuous}? And that even in primitive societies this is the case, regardless of moral values and indoctrination?And no. I have not learned that I do not want to be with the women I've slept in the past. Because those casual relationships are precisely what they were: From the beginning they served the purpose of pure pleasure without any commitment and without getting to know the person any deeper. That was the basis of these relationships. By your argument, prostitutes should be professional natural selectors when it comes to selecting life-partners. As you say it is a choice to seek pleasure or settling down. Precisely my point. Your case that women are sleeping around due to selecting the best partner is wrong and you said it yourself: They (and men) sleep around due to there choice and settle down due to their choice and not because their biological inner workings tells them to do so in their 20s. We are not slaves to our primitive evolutionary impulses. We were once. But we have a choice as a civilized society and we are not savages anymore. Simple as that and you said it yourself.

At no point have I claimed that sleeping around equates to finding an end mate, my initial comment statement something more nuanced that for those who take issue with women sleeping around and rejecting male candidates is something we should respect as their right to choose and for the bigger picture this means women and people will keep practicing discrimination (selection) until they find an end mate. Now whether sleeping around means no intention to settle down is not anything I contest, that in itself is precisely discriminatory selection where a person is choosing what to do with their reproduction functions.I've met my share of "fuck boys" but I'm not going to stand around generalising the entire male population and demeaning their \textbf{sexual} behaviour simply because they aren't choosing me, the empowered thing to do is shift my focus elsewhere which is to seek out the kind of man I want and/or in the appropriate spaces and see where that could lead.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@salad salad ¬†salad salad¬† I can agree with everything you've said.As for  being negatively implicated by hook up culture, I personally know its not easy to quickly jump back into the daring game with confidence because of fears regarding deceptive behaviour like you've mentioned and other negative consequences, my stress is purely on the notion that while I agree condemnation can help keep deceptive \textbf{promiscuous} behaviour regulated, that for those who are transparent with their promiscuity should not be condemned because that gives people full information to then make their next move in response to the move played. Do you agree?You've used the anecdote of the pressures of hook up culture and how that turned out being what that girl did not want, I empathise with her rather than condemn her for finding herself within hook up culture no matter how many men she has slept with, I think ideas promotion hook up culture are dangerous in this context. On the bright side, this girl learned and now can make the conscious effort to redeem herself in her dating life however I'm sure she will find herself troubled by judgmental men who can't embrace what her journey was and forgo the opportunity to seriously date someone who is otherwise worthy.To reiterate, I agree that hook up culture is pressuring people to behave promiscuously when they'd otherwise not want to do, this touches on the issue of consent arguably too which I think social leaders should put their focus into guiding people to be in touch with themselves and not the herd mentality, there's also the notion that people want to try and learn from the experience whether it hurts them or not and I am not sure if we can remove that choice. Second, if people are transparent in choosing a \textbf{promiscuous} lifestyle and in control of their intentions then that's their own business and shouldn't be used as ammunition to dimish their worth especially when it comes to choosing an end mate. A classic example of shaming women for excefisinf her right to sleep around is someone in the comment section brought up telegony, the theory whereby a woman's children resemble the traits of her previous \textbf{sexual} partners because sperm bonds to dna in her body, this commenter then said that this is why women who have slept with many men are "\textbf{crazy}" because her brain has been impeded too...

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@humanityandme Yes I agree that we should not shame people who are transparent with their \textbf{promiscuous} behavior. I am also a person who felt pressured to sleep around because that is expected of a man in his 20s. And I wanted to try it out myself. I can tell you that it was ok for some years. But at some point, I felt alone (even though I wasn't alone and I had women around me), there was a void inside of me, and even used (although I have not been used). From my personal experience I can say that it seems that deep down, at a very fundamental level I (not sure if I can say we to include all humans) desire something more intimate. I have read somewhere a similar comment where someone was shaming women for that. Telegony is actually new to me so I just read the Wikipedia article on telegony and from that it seems that no evidence has been found except in a 2014 which "reported a seemingly telegonic phenomenon in a fly". So this theory is inconclusive so far? I certainly will keep following this development of the theory.What are your thoughts on actually being with someone who was \textbf{promiscuous}? To me such behavior usually signals the following thoughts:- I cannot trust this person since sleeping around signals relationship instability (of course people change but what if I invest 5 - 10 years into a relationship and then this person reverts back to being \textbf{promiscuous}?)- sleeping around increases the chance of STDs and some STDs can still be transmitted using condoms- Do people actually lose the ability to intimately bond if treating \textbf{sex} casually?- Does this person seek the attention and validation from multiple people?- \textbf{Sex} and orgasm are highly intimate bonds between people due to the release of serotonin and oxytocin (the hormones which makes people fall in love). Kissing, cuddling and so on also releases these hormones. Thus, in essence you actually develop some emotional bond with every \textbf{sexual} partner you encounter. Will this person ever revert back and leave me for a previous \textbf{sexual} partner just because of the intimate bond? Will I ever do this? You also sometimes here people say "I am confused between loving person a and person b". Which to me indicates that promiscuity actually might harm your future serious love-life.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@salad salad I think it's impotent to consider why a person has slept with an x amount of people, pressure, loneliness, belief that it would be a serious relationship, trauma... All such things can be at play and not define whether a person will remain \textbf{promiscuous}.I once had a partner who wanted a "let's see how things go" relationship, they were open to other partners and it put me in a constant state of anxiety and fear that I would be left, wasn't good enough and therefore had to dilute the bond I felt with him and keep the rest of my emotions free and receptive to others just in case, this was my first experience of being affected by hook up culture and for a while feeling very fearful of bonding with one person in future and therefore always keeping a part of me held back or in other cases thinking it was normal to go fast into dating experiences. I have questioned whether this has primed me to be \textbf{promiscuous} (I wasn't \textbf{promiscuous}) but if one simply pauses and takes time to detox their life such as self reflection, healthy habits (working on oneself) then I think the buzz for promiscuity will die down and in place of that you can put in place the concerted effort to consciously go into dating with the intention of having one person. Also it's not just promiscuity, but emotional bonds with other people from a number of serious relationships someone had can even play into this inability to focus on just one person.I think mindfully setting the intention, knowing why you're doing can work with brain plasticity. It's like forming a habit.Ultimately it's down to trial and error. End of the day if someone doesn't meet you half way or if you don't then there is no pairing/relationship occuring and one has to let it go and move forwards unless there's conscious effort to recognise a problem and fix it. People may not realise the consequence of promiscuity until they find themselves consciously wanting one person but struggling to discipline their learned behaviour which they no longer identify with.I'm not the expert on this though.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Promiscuous & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - Female sexuality & \cellcolor{green!5}3/368 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.815 \\  \hline

All such things can be at play and not define whether a person will remain \textbf{promiscuous}.". Well look. I think that it is important to consider the cause behind it. Let us assume that it was loneliness. Well then, to me that indicates that this person has some issues. Let us say I am in a committed relationship with a person who has loneliness-issues. What if I have to go on a business trip for 5 months? Will she be loyal or due to her loneliness invite another man into her life.The things that you mentioned are indicators of emotionally unstable people. This again is helpful to guide you in dating people who have the qualities that you desire in a partner. I. e. I desire emotional stability in a \textbf{woman} and not a female who shows symptoms of borderline personality disorder.From what I've gained about you is that you rely far too much on trial and error. I believe that is a bit naive and it could get you hurt easily even though you can avoid it (and from what I take you have been hurt in the past). Such a red-flag system is quite helpful even though imperfect as you point out. But in the majority of cases it helps you pin-point the partners you do not want. And if you get one wrong by prejudice, then that is okay. It's a far better system than brute rote trial and error.I empathize with you on your experience. I myself was not \textbf{promiscuous} until my very first relationship which ended 7 years ago in her cheating after three years of commitment and it set me on this path. As you see and I mentioned earlier, most of us do not want to be \textbf{promiscuous}. It does not seem to reflect our "nature". It is often a reaction to our own personal experiences and what society expects or what the norm is nowadays.And yes you are right that with introspection one can come to an evaluation of what makes one truly happy: Many \textbf{sexual} partners? or on intimate partner who stays with you through good and bad times?But how many people have this ability of introspection? I would say, from my own personal experience, the majority of people are not capable. They simply just live without thinking deeper and complain about their unhappiness.I've also talked to \textbf{elderly} and asked them what makes them truly happy. Most of the time they give me the following answer: Deep and strong relationships with family members, friends, partner (love-life), children. So far none of them has mentioned being with multiple \textbf{sexual} partners. There is also a Ted Talk somewhere on this.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@pegpenguin I've seen some of Peterson's videos on female selection. I personally think that he is a bit too harsh on males (but this might be because his male audience is not the classical standard of a "masculine" man). And a bit naive when it comes to the dating scene. He assumes that females are in dating for purely selective reasons. But truth be told, many reject for fun, many reject for looks, many reject for money, many reject because they have already a hand full of dating partners and cannot handle another one at the time. His reasoning applies in a world where the core assumption is that females operate in the dating scene primarily for selecting a partner to settle down. This is too discrepant from today's casual dating hookup culture. Thus, none of Peterson's arguments apply. It could also be that the females that he is talking about are at the stage of settling down, then his arguments do apply. But they definitely do not apply to modern young females of the West where settling down is pushed towards the end of one's 20s/early 30s or beyond.Today's dating scene is at its fundamental core to be \textbf{promiscuous} and have fun. I've yet to meet a person who says "I want to date multiple people at the same time because that increases my chances of settling down". It is simply not the case. They do it because they are young and that's expected from them at that \textbf{age}, they are at university, they fear commitment, they fear abandonment, and of course over-sexualised media such as the music industry and movies have made sleeping around the norm. ¬†But all of this behavior comes at a cost and as you said: "Anyway, the real world will teach you what university propaganda  brainwashing indoctrination will not, so there's hope yet.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@pegpenguin ¬†you evidently aren't familiar with Jordan Petersons work, I can tell because you've not referenced how he's highly critical of women and feminism and dedicated a large chunk of his work to the issue, in fact he's even said himself that his primary audience are young men whos masculinity is under threat. Because I'm a critical thinker I will extract what's reasonable from any and every thinker, Petersons segment on natural selection is concrete science and I'm not going to engage in your cognitive dissonance that this is what's not playing out in reality. Also the very notion that I'm a feminist and postmodernist would be enough to give Peterson an aneurism, it's women like me he absolutely loathes and considers cancers to society, all of this to say, nice attempt at trying to control my confidence to express myself by engineering an idea that I'm a loyal Peterson follower. I can see I bother you. I don't sleep around, I'm also going to be 27 this year. There's absolutely no sheltering from the outside world by this stage. I've noticed people with your mindset seem to think just because someone has been university educated that it means they don't engage with life and learn skills practically, there's so many hours in a day, a week, a month and a year, life evolves within that time and you spend the rest of your time 'living'... As for me allegedly lacking options for marriage, sorry to burst your bubble but  I've had men who want to marry me however I've not felt well suited to them and that's a dangerous way to go into marriage through forcing oneself or being forced, to raise a family if one isn't comfortable with the pairing. That's the first rule my upbringing instilled in me. All I've gathered from your comment is "you're a \textbf{woman} who men can't settle down and that bothers me because I've been personally affected therefore here's all the ways I'm going to attempt to make you feel just as inferior and flawed as I do so that you will be obedient to my will"Quite heavy low IQ stuff to be reading on the Internet, sounds like it's coming from an Incel.End of the day we can spend all the time criticising women but time should be going into self development, being a better person and eventually able to seek out and be a good partner.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}1/408 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.245 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@salad salad the factors I listed that could lead to \textbf{promiscuous} behaviour are arbitrary and not all inclusive, there are many more factors to consider. The point I was making that it's worth investigating why someone was \textbf{promiscuous}.At no point did I disagree that close human relationships aren't important and what humans are in pursuit of within their life time, so I am not sure why you had to explain that to me. Did I give the impression I lack awareness of that? Lastly my mention of trial and error is exactly what dating is about, obviously one accumulates knowledge along the way about \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} flags and can avoid them as they go along, that's a given and I didn't feel the need to explain thst but since it's popped up then there's my explanation- people grow, they're going to learn from the past and not throw themselves into every situation with \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} flags.Petersons comments on natural selection still hold true when it comes to females choosing which men to be \textbf{promiscuous} with, that in itself is part of the natural selection process. But the main issue Peterson was making is that a \textbf{woman} chooses (ideally) who she will carry a child with, she is the one who has to live with the consequences of carrying the child for 9 months and if she doesn't have a strong partner and support network then this will affect her and the child's wellbeing. There's another thinker called Dr Gabor Mate, who talks about how pregnant women who are stressed and don't feel secure as well as parents, no matter how loving they may be, end up negatively implicating the child's development and so I can fully support a \textbf{woman}'s strong sense of being careful about who she chooses as an end mate.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@humanityandme No you did not give the impression that you lack awareness of the importance of close human relationships. I was discussing the long-term risks of \textbf{promiscuous} behavior in general. Part-taking in sleeping around rather than building a close relationship with someone within our youth might be damaging since youth fades and your overall market value pretty much decreases after you hit 30 in most cases. You might end up without a deep connection and that can be a miserable situation to find yourself in.

I'd go as far as to argue that sleeping around is something women do to fill the times where they don't have a partner, they go out partying or feel they need physical connection and so they sleep around, its a side lifestyle not the primary lifestyle itself.

My comment here was to provide nuance into why women may be sleeping around and to provide alternative discourse on why they are doing it contrary to popular beliefs. For example if a \textbf{woman} is having casual \textbf{sex}, it could simply be for hedonistic pleasure seeking needs but nonetheless she still values a monogamous emotionally strong partnership. You are free to either take that view or not and move on. What matters is what we/YOU are doing to situate yourself in an advantageous position to find an end mate, knowing what you know. Ie how can I become a more attractive candidate for marriage, where do I need to go to find such people, should I be on the Internet preventing someone from practising their own autonomy when I myself have my own and can find women who align to what I value in partnership....

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@salad salad I agree with everything you just said. You're also way smarter than he is, lol.Sad though that people fall for his babbling gibberish. That's all it is to me. There's much more intelligent people to spend my time listening to, that I can actually learn life-lessons from. Everything he says is basically redundant. I mean, if you subtract the biased brainwashing aspects of his opinion. I mean, it isn't a part of the real world. Basically, his talk about men vs. women is chock full of \textbf{mental} masturbation as far as I'm concerned. I guess it makes for good university discussion, but that's it. A lot of "higher-learning" and big words, with no substance behind it. It doesn't have a place in the real world.In the real world, what is actually happening‚Ä¶ is that \textbf{promiscuous} women are basically on a binge of instant-gratification on all fronts (\textbf{sex}, attention, other forms of ego-trips to feel self-important), because of the powers that social media provides them today. Then later in life, while their looks start to wane, they will attempt to attach to a \textbf{beta male} provider for "stability" finally (assuming they even can, that is).In fact "humanityandme" just admitted to be a great, walking  living example right now. She's 27, and about to hit the wall, which is usually around \textbf{age} 30. Now after sleeping around in her younger years, she's looking for a \textbf{beta male} sucker to develop a life partner with. What a joke. I mean, that people still think smart people like me think that's not what's actually happening, and that women are the one's being ultra selective at this juncture, lol.But many of these potential \textbf{beta male} suitors are waking up too, and will be aware that they're just being used as per female desperation  as an ATM or security blanket to oppose female loneliness. This is the sad truth in society today, that Jordan Peterson I'm sure would never touch with a ten-foot pole, because it will cause him to be demonized further (socially unacceptable in public culture). Either that, or he actually is rather clueless and oblivious. I tend to think he probably knows better. As I said, he's a clever little weasel. In fact, from what I hear, he avoided being debated by certain MGTOW content creators from YouTube, so he probably knew already that he would be in a lose-lose situation, and just get cornered too quickly by that pesky little thing, called truth \& reality.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Beta male, Mental, Promiscuous, Sex & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Gender - Female sexuality, Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments, Sexual Identity - Male homosexuality & \cellcolor{green!5}7/421 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.663 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@pegpenguin I've observed this same behavior that women tend to live their life out in their youth and the moment they approach 30 they tend to settle down. I even have female friends who admit this to me. This is \textbf{nothing} new. This is taught from a young \textbf{age} to men and women. Even my own parents encouraged me to sleep around just because your young and at university. But they often are not informed about the consequences of such advice as I pointed out in an earlier comment where I linked two papers and a Wikipedia article on BPD.I adapted a rule: If a \textbf{woman} does not settle down with me within her youth, then she does not deserve me to be there for her when she is "older".And I am not doing this because I'm a butt-hurt male. It is very well-known that in society females are most valuable between their teenage years and until they hit 30-something. Men are disposable in society during this life-span. And Peterson actually said this himself. Women know this. And thus they live out their lives in their youth and settle down. So I am here asking myself: Why would I settle down with someone who thinks this malevolently and evil?Now, I do not subsribe to \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} pill philosophy or MGTOW. I do watch videos and read upon it and I can definitely say that a lot of what these philosophies say does fall in place with my experience and observation. But staying away or holding that much anger against women and ranting is not healthy. And IMO staying totally away from female affection and a long-term commitment is not healthy, especially in your later years. So far I am 26 and still trying to figure these things out. I still participate in dating even if I get hurt. But I definitely know how to spot the potential problematic females and kick them out of my life pretty fast (of course this becomes more difficult if you develop feelings for such a person but that should not prevent you from having self-respect).And I will try again and again but with defenses up so that I do not end up in a chaotic life where I lose my emotional sanity (due to females who destroyed themselves emotionally by sleeping around), or be divorced and lose my financial "empire" because divorce courts favor females as of today. That is all I gain from \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} pill philosophy and MGTOW. Defend yourself in a proper way and still try.If at the end of my life I will not find my so called unicorn. It's fine.

If we don't, then the majority of people you will come into contact in dating will show signs from the BDP symptoms list. Do you want to have such people around you? In your society?The reason why single young women act \textbf{promiscuous} is irrelevant to me unless they are one of the few humans who truly are not monogamous by nature (then we should not criticize them and accept them for what they are; however, if they desire this non-critical treatment, then it is their obligation to provide me evidence that promiscuity is inherently built in them and not that they feel like being \textbf{promiscuous}). If they act \textbf{promiscuous} out of boredom or do not want to be alone, then that is a sign of some deeper inner psychological problem. And I will always advice people (men and women) to stay away from \textbf{promiscuous} behavior and point them to articles.The second paper clearly shows that \textbf{promiscuous} and casual hookup behavior shows signs of BDP symptoms. Now, looking at the list of BPD symptoms should ring some alarm bells especially since in today's modern \textbf{age} where \textbf{sex} is tolerated without criticism (the same side you are defending) it is highly difficult to find a person who has not been sleeping around (including myself).My point is: sleeping around comes with emotional and psychological consequences. Social leaders and educators should inform the younger people about these risks rather than encourage and push towards more free irresponsible \textbf{sexual} life-styles. And there is an explosion in casual hookup culture due to social media, easier communication, higher turnover of meeting new people, societal push towards consequence free \textbf{sex}, no commitment relationships, over-sexualised media, apps like Tinder, you name it.Edit: From the article I presented people who are \textbf{promiscuous} actually do get some truthful tarnish. \textbf{Common} is to say "Women lose the ability to emotionally bond if they engage in too much casual \textbf{sex}/have too many \textbf{sexual} partners", which look again at the BPD symptoms list and there is some truth to it. They have a habit to replace a partner in critical situations rather than repair. Are impulsive, and so on.People also tend to say that women who have slept around are "damaged goods". Again a primitive way of articulating things but BPD symptomatology is in essence a damaged emotional and psychological state.  In short, we usually say that such a \textbf{woman} is "\textbf{crazy}" due to her emotional instability. Which again by the BPD symptoms is accurate even though a primitive thing to say.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Age, Common, Crazy, Promiscuous, Sex, Sexual, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Age - General, Gender - Female sexuality, Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}17/569 & \cellcolor{green!5}2.988 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@salad salad Okay good, your post finally showed up. You seem to have a good head on your shoulders. And at least you're aware of any potential pitfalls. My rants have more to do with women thinking that men aren't aware, like we're all just slow and stupid, and should worship the ground they walk on now more than ever, and be lucky enough to kiss their feet given the chance. I don't mind deprogramming that, even if it's just for intellectual sport (trolling).I actually love women, which is why I get irritated by useless propaganda that feeds them ear-candy (ie. Peterson Pandering, etc). I'd rather be harsh, even if they hate me for it after, rather than just tell them what they want to hear, or what feeds their ego. I don't mind. I'm not here to suck up to anybody. And at least it could wake them up to reality, and what's actually going on, rather than reinforcing university talking point gibberish.Obviously, you already are aware, as a young man, so that's \textbf{nothing} new to you anyway, and so perhaps how I say things sounds like \textbf{nothing} but \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} pill rage. In other words, it's redundant to you at this point (as it would be to me as well).Actually, I have a young niece that's living with me currently, that's just out of school, as well as an even younger niece (baby) just starting to observe this \textbf{crazy} world with wide eyes, so some of the concerns young women will have, affect me indirectly down the road, in a way. I guess I can't escape them entirely, lol.As for me personally, I don't actually want to get married, or have children of my own, just for the sake of "settling down" or to have a family.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@pegpenguin I see where you are coming from. Well to be fair these men who put women on a pedestal as they say make the matter even worse and the so called beta orbiters too. But these men would do everything just to sleep with a \textbf{woman} which just reinforces their behavior. I've seen this many times and I have lost a handful of women just because they didn't take my criticism and moved on to a more submissive man.Let me tell you one of my recent experiences. There was a female who I got to know and we connected pretty well. We hooked up very fast and said that we do not want anything serious. It all went well for about a month. At some point we went together to a party and at the after party she asked another guy in front of me to sleep at her place. I objected to this and took her out of the apartment and told her that her behavior is disrespectful towards me and disgusting. She simply replied "You should share me and I expect you to not react when I take home another guy in front of you". Funny thing she at the sime would seek my affection whenever she was feeling sad or depressed and needed me for cuddling, etc. So she showed some huge signs of emotional instability disorder aka borderline personality disorder (Impulsive and extreme reactions towards mild criticism, one day affection behavior towards me and the next day she would be "cold", wanting to date multiple people at the same time, anxiety, insecurities; I can tell you that the entire experience with her personality was no fun at all). Well I disagreed with all of this since I consider this respect if I invest my time in going out with her and she however flirts with other men in front of me and tries hooking up with other men and if she cannot find anyone only then I will get her attention and \textbf{sex}. It is simply not mannered and disrespectful behavior no matter what form of \textbf{sexual} relationship we have going on. If we go out together, we stay together that evening end of the discussion. So I broke off contact and told her that her behavior was bitchy and disrespectful (I sensed that she was trying to make me her little slave so to speak and see how far she can toy with me/how much I would tolerate; at that point I asked myself: What did she bring to our casual relationship except \textbf{sex}? \textbf{Nothing} but problems).After a month I showed some weakness and I contacted her and asked her for a talk because I was feeling sad about the situation. She only replied "I do not need a talk and you made some bad accusations towards me. You also cannot expect me to waste my precious time just to make you feel better.". At this point I wished her all the best in life and I deleted her and since ignored her.Point of the case being. They are entitled to so much and since they can replace someone instantly, they do not even care for reflection about their behavior and introspection.I hope that you have read the abstract of the earlier papers I posted and you inform your nieces about the dangers of \textbf{promiscuous} behavior in today's society. So that they do not grow up and show symptoms of insecurity, emotional and psychological instabilities such as my above experience with that unstable \textbf{woman}. Educate your nieces and instill in them some real good \textbf{old} fashioned lady like values.About marriage: I do not think that one should marry. I do not see the purpose of it. I never saw the purpose of marriage. I always just liked the ceremony where the two families come together and celebrate and have a big feast. What does marriage guarantee? That he or she will not cheat? Or leave? A relationship should not be built upon such chaining constraints but rather worked upon (both partners of course). I however do desire a partner since I strongly believe that love and affection from a female and sharing an intimate and deep connection is healthy.Don't you think that you will feel lonely at some point and unhappy without such a connection or without having children/a family?\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Nothing, Old, Promiscuous, Sex, Sexual, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s, Age - Youngsters, Gender - Female sexuality, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}8/732 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.093 \\  \hline

This doesn't even need to go that deeply into a diagnosed \textbf{mental} illness.

I naturally developed this since I was raised in a different culture (born in Romania and raised after \textbf{age} 11 in Germany) where I was not accepted for the first 8 years in society and was pushed around. Thus, I needed to act "strong" in front of my "enemies" but then let out the emotions at home for example in bed.It's really nice to here the lovely stories about your niece!

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small ‚Äã \@pegpenguin  I don't believe that shit-testing women makes the matter any better. I already find the casual dating scene too chaotic and unstable. I do not want to add to this problem anymore. I want to make it better for both parties. I see the emergence of tips and tricks for both genders on how to date and in my opinion this makes the matter just worse and it starts an unnecessary hatred between the two genders. I believe that we are in this together and communication and discussion between the two genders involved is the best approach and not through strategic defense or offense mechanisms. Dating should be easy for crying out loud and not a part-time job where we have to read fucking books and watch coaches or self-help crap. It is a mating process and not a god damn strategy game. It's always a chase and the power is imbalanced (women hold it).For those who do not believe me, then try the following: Go with a female to a club. You as a male ask all females if they want to have \textbf{sex} with you immediately and go home with you now. Chances are you won't get anyone (if you're lucky then yes). Let the girl do it. She will have many men who agree to this. BTW: it is actually a fun experiment to do, you get to laugh afterwards about the reactions with your female friend :D.So if a \textbf{woman} behaves in shit-testing me or playing any dating games, then I immediately stop talking to her because that shows me immaturity (which I find highly unattractive) and that she is just a little sheep manipulated by her friends and blog articles like "5 ways to make him chase you". Such people are not worth my time.I am very radical to this. It's either you are a "normal" human being and devote your attention entirely to me in order to get to know me or goodbye and good luck in however you think about this dating game and with your petty amateur psychological games. In the end there will never be a perfect safe method to weed out the "evil" females or males. It all boils down to what \@humanityandme said: trial and error and some luck.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@pegpenguin I was living in an area in Germany where people there tend to be a little too far right inclined. So it was a rough environment to grow up, I would say. But roughly at \textbf{age} 19, when I put on some muscle mass and the \textbf{fruit} of my integration into society and educational achievements started to show that I was working hard, they started accepting me. I actually turned many of those "enemies" into friends. However, I will never see them as really close friends since given the past.I moved from Germany to Sweden four years ago so I have not experienced the situation  at first hand with the flooding. But a similar situation is happening in Sweden too, so you know. I do feel some tensions here and there throughout society but as long as it stays calm, then it's okay for me. I am staying away from politics as much as possible and I do not follow news or watch TV. Never actually did. I have the feeling that it ruins my perception of the world and gives an impression that the world is far more dangerous than it actually is. And in the case that the flooding will become a serious threat to my well-being and the life how I imagine it to be, then I will move again. I will not be a collateral damage in some stupid political "" trend.George Bruno has a reputation for being "the father we never had". He tries to preserve the \textbf{old} classical role of masculinity in society, I believe is a \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} pill and a firm believer in what he calls practical stoicism. He usually gives advice and wisdom. Fun to think about and sometimes laugh about but sometimes too radical as well.I can only empathize with her. I myself was raised by my grandparents till the \textbf{age} of 11 since my parents divorced when I was 3 years \textbf{old} and they both ran away from the responsibility. Moved to Germany at \textbf{age} 11 then when she re-married, so basically ended up from one family to the other.I also witnessed female instability behavior at first hand. I.e. how she behaved towards her husband and in the end divorce raped him for half of his house and so on. Probably that is why I am on my defenses but not only. First three years relationship ended by the girl cheating with a good friend of mine. This is maybe why I as a mathematician am so interested in female behavior in the dating scene. I do not buy into this narrative that people try to sell me that females are in only for the \textbf{sexual} drive and are not conscious about the mind fuckery and behavior they do. I've experience too much, same for my brother, close friends and many other males to buy into this victimized innocence game. So far my the strongest evidence points towards entitlement at a young \textbf{age}, huge expectations when it comes to selecting partners, sleeping around, showing clear signs of emotional instability symptoms, being conscious about their value when they are young and the decline of their value once they hit 30-something and thus abuse this knowledge, and the list goes on. And I have talked to this with \textbf{sexual} partners and female friends and many admit to doing this on a regular basis and having knowledge of this. I.e. part-taking in female fuckery. Flaking on dates because another desirable man came up. Seeking attention and validation from multiple men. Keeping men in the friend-zone as backup. Not being transparent of dating multiple partners at the same time just to give the illusion of a good girl because they see a potential partner in me but do not want to settle down at this point.So of course I am here asking myself and many man start doing the same: Why should I take such a \textbf{woman}?Our reaction is no different from the females who know that their value in society is very valuable between their teenage years and 20s and declines after that and men are disposable during their teens and 20s and are valuable after 30+. So they use this information to live out their lives and settle down after that.Men start to do the same. Recognize this behavior and use that information to say "No I will not settle down with you when your market value and youth declines".Where will this lead to? I do not know.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@pegpenguin I am sure you heard about the core assumption of \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} pill philosophy:"All women are hypergamous by nature"I am currently examining this statement. I found an interesting paper which shows that when it comes purely to education, the trend is now in the U.S. and Brazil that women do not act hypergamous when it comes to education. The number of homogamous relationships far outnumber that of hypergamous relationships (when it comes down purely to educational degrees).To me this indicates that the \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} pill claim that it is in their nature is dubious or that educational status is not important to them anymore as a hypergamous criteria. Women were oppressed in terms of educational degrees until the 20th century. So hypergamy could be a societal thing. Maybe it was natural in primitive civilizations but modern civilizations (past Ancient Egypt) are far more complex than evolutionary impulses.Another study from Hungary argues "We argue that females switch between homogamy and hypergamy and vice versa, depending on the particular social circumstance." and "Males, more than females, prefer and choose younger mates at marriage, whereas females tend to marry higher educated mates.". We can see this as a hyperamous criteria from men. Men wish to marry up to young beauty. However, in Western societies young women act \textbf{promiscuous} before settling down at the end of their 20s/early 30s and men do not see that as a good hypergamous criteria. Thus, we are left with this mating dynamic where men refuse to mate the 30+ one's and females refuse to mate in their 20s. Really stupid situation if you ask me.Note that this is Hungary and different from a more developed country like the U.S.From what I gather so far is that hypergamy might be natural to women in primitive times. However, in the end hypergamous trends tend to mild down where there is \textbf{gender} equality throughout society at different levels. Pointing in the direction that hypargamy is a socio-economical strategy for commitment and not a primal instinct of female behavior. So in my view, what original feminism (not some of the radical one's) which pushes for equality of sexes at all socio-cultural dimensions (especially economic and educational wise and rights) is the best bet to get rid of hypergamous behavior.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender, Promiscuous, Red & \cellcolor{green!5} Ideological and Political Identity - General, Ethnicity - Native-American, Gender - Female sexuality, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}6/382 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.571 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@salad salad It's true that women don't really care about a man's education level, in particular in a society where it's not necessarily valued in terms of social structure so much (social meaning relationships and community hierarchy). I mean, I've never heard a \textbf{woman} say, wow, that guy has a BIG degree :-)But, when education already translates to \$\$\$  riches (a man landed a good paying job because of that degree, for example), only then may it have an impact on social status, and therefor becomes sought after.

Oh, maybe to do their homework for them, but that's about it.Anyway, it sounds like you're searching for a fix for society. Good luck with that, lol.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@salad salad Today for some reason I was thinking about this hot \& beautiful girl that used to work at the local grocery store, where I used to shop. She had jet \textbf{black} hair, with teal \textbf{coloured} eyes, and very natural, feminine lips‚Ä¶ you know the kind. She would subtly flirt with me once in a while, but wasn't the type to make an obvious move or advancement. I suppose that's the man's job. I mean, it's obvious she wasn't the type that needed to make any advancements, but she would still drop hints. For example, one time when I was at a different cashier to check out (with an older \textbf{woman} behind the counter), this younger girl would leave her station, and come to my cashier, stand right in front of me, while pretending there was actually something necessary to discuss with the other \textbf{woman}. But the way she paused at one point in silence looking at me, I could tell she wanted me to say something to her, but I was more a "deer in the headlights" so to speak. I wasn't expecting any kind of interaction like this, I just wanted to pay for my stuff and go. Honestly, all I was thinking at the moment is that I can't afford a girlfriend right now! They too expensive, especially one that beautiful to upkeep and keep loyal, ha haWell anyway, not long after, that grocery store closed up, and so she must have lost her job. I'm guessing she was a student probably working there just for some extra money. I'd say she was probably about 22-25 years \textbf{old} or so. Keep in mind that grocery store actually paid workers well (not just minimum wage), but maybe that's why it went out of business too. You know, now quality is not a priority these days. Everything is basically a \textbf{race} to the bottom, sadly.What's the point of this? I hope you weren't expecting there to be one, lolI was just enjoying reflecting at how she had such a natural beauty.

Young adults are a laboratory experiment now.Read the Wikipedia article on hookup culture, especially the sections "Risk", "Drugs and \textbf{Alcohol}" and "Extra effects and causes". All the papers are referenced to the claims made.You will notice that my case stands and the majority of people who part-take in all of this come out with negative consequences rather than positive which is reason enough to get rid of this epidemic and reinforce good \textbf{old} fashioned "normal" relationships, with the option of breaking up of course if things do not work out.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Mental, Old, Sex, Sexual, alcohol & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - Over 65s, Behavioural Addiction - Alcohol, Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}8/221 & \cellcolor{green!27}3.62 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@humanityandme  This narrative that you are selling that people can do whatever they want and sleep around in their youth for their pure \textbf{sexual} pleasure and then settle down and no big deal is wrong. It is too naive. I can ask you a similar question: "Why bother setting boundaries for children?" They are creatures given by nature so they should know how to operate by their own impulses. PRECISELY: Because children have no idea about the consequences of their actions. And same for the hookup culture. We, the young population, have no information whatsoever on the consequences because our parents have no clue and our educators have no clue so no one ever informed us. We are basically rats in an experiment. I researched this and discussed my side now. I made my mind clear. There is some truth to saying nasty stuff like "women who have slept around are damaged goods" and I will not date women who have slept around just as a precaution towards my own well-being. Now, shaming helps me filter out these women. If you ask me "Should we shame them?". My answer is No. But we should label them. Should we glorify the playboy womanizer? No but we should label him. In a utopian \textbf{sexual} reputation system we would just label people without shaming. But we can dream about such a system all day and never implement it because guess what? People lie about the amount of \textbf{sexual} partners when they wish to commit. I believe that society has some "natural" ways of dealing with many issues and labeling promiscuity is a good thing. PS: Studies have shown that it is UNLIKELY that people on campuses engage in non-committed \textbf{sexual} intercourse without the abuse of substances.

Look at \textbf{r\textbf{ed}} pill philosophy. How do you explain that evolution. Men evolved now within 50 years to be extra selective?

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@salad salad You made me just realize something. Perhaps the real reason that I find Peterson annoying when talking about women as though only they have the ball in their court and men are just perpetually at their mercy, is that I'm a walking  living example of how untrue that is. So it just feels like someone lying to my face (well not literally, but to a clueless crowd of young students). Especially when I hear, read, or see other examples beyond myself as well.This doesn't mean I'm oblivious to the "scientific" theory behind it (which is why I simply called his unbiased aspects, as merely being redundant). In other words, it's personally useless to me to learn anything from. I mean, it's obvious that women are the ones who are the gatekeepers of \textbf{sexual} interaction (and therefor procreation). Do we really need to pay for university courses on this? Good thing I found some of his talks for free, because that's what they're worth.So even though we know women are the primary selectors of \textbf{sexual} interaction, does it really go any further than that? I mean, we are not cavemen anymore. Society is more complex today. To ignore that, is like having blinders on. As I said earlier, the truth of society today is that social media is allowing women to find and have \textbf{sexual} partners, as easy as finding a pack of gum or candy at a corner store‚Ä¶ perhaps even easier, because the candy sometimes even comes to you at beck-n-call! Like take-out delivery, but for free with no delivery charge. In fact, sometimes the "food" itself pays as it comes to you!However, it's also the information \textbf{age} now, where men have become more aware of female advantage, and how they use it to their benefit. In other words, becoming "Captain Save-A-Ho" these days, unless you've been living under a rock, has to be a more conscious decision, rather than one stemmed from naivet√©, as it was in the past. And what's also crumbling is the social constructs that it's somehow still mens' "duty" to take care of these \textbf{promiscuous}, attention-addicted, disloyal females, once their youth \& beauty is finally deteriorating, far beyond any semblance of a once past innocence.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Promiscuous, Sexual & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Gender - Female sexuality, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}5/377 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.326 \\  \hline

My point was that both genders get a label for sleeping around in our society. The man gets the label "playboy" and usually the female gets the label "bitch".Now, I am not arguing that shaming or praising is good. However, I see this labeling as a reputational system to help us guide which people sleep around and weed them out when we are searching for commitment. Just as you said "But as a \textbf{woman} I'd never date a player who slept with a bunch of women. He'd probably just sleep around while we're dating".

The real issue these women have is the reality that they are not equal to men when it comes to all the things that make men look ABSOLUTELY AWESOME! Just about any \textbf{woman} can learn how to do things that men can do, but they have to learn it from men who brought it into existence in the first place! And when they finally put on their cute little \textbf{fuzzy} equality mittens to show the world how equal they are to men by doing anything a man can do, the cool image that interesting men possess due to their masculinity will never be exuded by a \textbf{woman} no matter how good a \textbf{woman} gets at emulating men and masculinity! The strange thing about all this equality and diversity and \textbf{woman} power and women's marches and \textbf{pussy} hats and empowerment and self-esteem is that when women acquire the type of skill and knowledge and achieve the type of status and social prestige that make men stand out from average men, they tend to look down on men that are below them in that regard, whereas men just see women as they are. Men don't lose their attraction for women that they have more money, status or skills than. That should let you know that women are valued for what they are valued for, not for what men are valued for, which is why women want to be seen as equal to men! Men are the reason why we enjoy the modern world. All the cool, interesting, intellectual, fun things that we partake in were brought to you by men. Women are vessels that are used to reproduce people and to serve as outlets for recreational \textbf{sex}. THAT is reality, so shoot me! Women partake in what men do, but they are not needed for it, and the world doesn't count on women for it! Women are boring. Women can be mothers and raise kids, or they can be \textbf{sexual} entertainers and swallow kids ROFL! A man's usefulness to the world is WAY more interesting and fascinating. Only men who allow themselves to be shackled to a \textbf{woman} or who blindly serve as cogs in the wheel live dull, uninteresting lives like women do. Like I've mentioned on numerous occasions, men get to look cool while depositing their sperm, whereas women just get to be sperm receptacles, sperm depositories, human toilets! I think it's safe to say, blessed are you, lord, our god, ruler of the universe who has not made me a \textbf{woman}!!!Women's so called empowerment relies on men's weaknesses. The only types of men women are better than are dopey, \textbf{lame} ass, \textbf{dumb} ass dudes. Lifting women up at the expense of men isn't a testament to women's superiority. Marginalizing men and boys so women and girls can have a leg up is patronizing and condescending, not empowering. That is a good way to treat women as the inferior beings that they are. Coddling women like they are retarded children only proves how inferior they are to men. Men don't need billions of dollars spent on them to get into stem. The NBA has to lose millions of dollars each year to keep the wnba in existence. \textbf{Nobody} is holding women back, women are just weak and retarded and can't handle equality. Women aren't built to be equal to men. Women are so obsessed with comparing themselves to men and competing with men and trying to get men to acknowledge them as equal to men or "equally worthy" as men. These are attitudes and behaviors of people who feel inadequate, insecure, and envious, not equal. I don't run around trying to prove my worth to people that are on the same level as me intellectually or otherwise. And when I see people that are better than me at anything, I admire them for it. I don't try to get even with them by shoving something I'm better than them at in their face as a pathetic way to feed them humble pie or to redeem myself. Another strange thing about all this equality and diversity and \textbf{woman} power and women's marches and \textbf{pussy} hats and empowerment and self-esteem is that women hold men to higher standards than they hold themselves and other women to, all the while tormenting men into seeing them as their equals! For instance, women don't look down on women who cry all the time over every fleeting emotion they feel or express, but they would laugh at a man and see him as a wuss if he acted in similar ways. Women don't look down on women that are broke, homeless, needy, and unable to support their children, but a man in a similar position would be seen as a complete loser. In fact, that \textbf{woman} would be asked by her friend or family member if she can get help from some man she might be in contact with. And get this, if said man is unable to help this \textbf{woman} out of her situation, HE will be considered the loser! Yes, he will be considered useless and good for \textbf{nothing} for being unable to come to some weak, needy \textbf{woman}'s rescue! Women don't look down on women that take public transportation, but they look down their noses on men that don't own their own vehicles. Women don't look down on women that stay home and raise their kids while the provider raises her and her kids, but a stay at home dad is seen as pathetic. I could add to this list, but I think you get the point. Women seem to have a hard time swallowing the bitter truth. And the bitter truth is that men lay down the groundwork, while women just lay down on the ground and get worked, then get provided for by the government or by some man.What was that???"Women invented things too", right ladies?!Ladies, I'm all out of gold stars and happy face stickers, but I hope to see you on the next "day without a \textbf{woman}"! Due to the amount of sandwiches left unmade at the last "day without a \textbf{woman}", I will NEVER forget just how important the whamen are!The strangest thing about all this equality and diversity and \textbf{woman} power and women's marches and \textbf{pussy} hats and empowerment and self-estem is that women are trying to convince the same men that they desire so desperately to be seen as "equal to" that women are better and smarter than men! And they do all this while being in need of constant and endless validation from men!

Why? Because that's looks FEMININE.In nature, almost all the time the male chases the female, HE gets on top of HER and has \textbf{sex} with her (if she allows it), but this is a MASCULINE behavior to chase and have \textbf{sex}.Sooooo ladies... when YOU a \textbf{woman} chases men, has a lot of \textbf{sex}..

But all around me are men who honestly, genuinely love their partners, wives, girlfriends but still cheat. If you ask them why, they genuinely do not know why they just can't stop. And yet, they LOVE their partner. And I think everyone can agree that men and women do not cheat on the same scale at all. Infact, women cheating is a fairly recent phenomenon.

Maybe not in terms of how often one performs \textbf{sex} but in terms of how many \textbf{sexual} partners one has. We definitely see a difference in \textbf{sexual} behavior from earlier times to now. We have nowadays a casual dating hookup culture which did not exist in this excessive fashion. And every \textbf{sexual} behavior trend has consequences upon society and overall happiness. So far, the majority of people nowadays are less happy in marriages, the depression rate increases (whether that correlates with being \textbf{promiscuous} I do not know. However, I strongly believe that love-life does play a huge role in overall happiness and having many/multiple \textbf{sexual} partners which is an increasing \textbf{sexual} behavior nowadays actually prevents you from finding true love. Of course, as you said some people are \textbf{promiscuous} but the majority isn't. But as I said \textbf{sexual} behavior is cultural and ever changing in society and most people follow precisely what society expects them to do and the majority of people do not have the self-awareness like you do to think about what they desire and what makes them happy. They usually just follow which leads them to bad decisions and unhappiness.), increase in STDs (condoms do not actually protect from some STDs), higher divorce rates, more unwanted pregnancies, more single mothers, etc.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Promiscuous, Sex, Sexual & \cellcolor{green!5}Gender - Female sexuality, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!5}10/234 & \cellcolor{green!5}4.274 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@Martin K. Show me the study. What does it mean that the "reality of \textbf{sex} still remains quite reasonable for the majority of ppl"? What \textbf{age} group are you if I may ask? I can tell you that there is definitely an increase in people hooking up casually which in the past was not the case. Thus \textbf{sexual} behavior has changed. They do not act naturally when it comes to \textbf{sex}. People are influenced by whatever is the norm and act accordingly.Simple example: Over-consumption did not exist. Yet it occurs nowadays because it is part of our society and culture. People will act according to the constraints of legislation and the rules of society. Same for \textbf{sexual} behavior. If you impose constraints on how many \textbf{sexual} partners are socially accepted, then most people will behave accordingly. If you let them live out their sexuality however they wish without any consequences then they will do that.My point is that \textbf{promiscuous} behavior seems to indicate that psychological and behavior consequences to arise in such people. As I mentioned earlier. Having multiple partners does correlate with increase in unhappiness, depression, higher divorce rates, higher chance of unwanted pregnancy, higher chance of STDs, higher change of being a single mother (which in itself usually produces children and later adults with psychological instabilities), etc.Casual hookup dating culture is fairly new and has to be taken with care. A civilized society can only function if we procreate and provide a healthy environment in which we can raise children. If promiscuity is an indicator that correlates with people being less capable of forming long lasting relationships (which my above mentioned correlations suggest), then that leads to a serious problem and we should not promote it and rather inform the upcoming youth about the dangers.PS: I do not buy your argument at all. \textbf{Sexual} behavior is influenced by oversexualised media and whatever is prevalent in the culture. Friends with benefits relationships did not exist in the past, open relationships same thing. Oversexualised media actually does stimulate \textbf{sexual} behavior. Same for free internet porn culture. You imitate what you see in those videos. I've done this, some partners have demanded or complained about this.

Just like your parents can have influence on who you are and how you think even long after they are dead they are still with you. The thing is the more \textbf{promiscuous} means you have higher chances of dealing with many people who have deep rooted problems and unsolved issues (trying to escape their issues by being in relationships one after the other) and it adds up very fast and it all affects your psyche and your image of yourself. And we need to bear the burden of that. Especially if you are someone sensitive or with a lot of empathy and if you have a good memory it will stay with you a long time maybe forever. I see it more about something psychological than physical DNA although its hard to know what happens at the microscopic level and we are still making lot of discoveries about genetics and how it evolves over time. I'm curious tough even if those people pretend they are happy if they would want their children to have \textbf{promiscuous} adult life or not.

I dont think anyone should be encouraged to just sleep around, \textbf{sex} will always be better with a trusted partner but also single men or women if they want to have abit of fun and are being safe then go for it. For alot of women they find they need that security of a relationship to enjoy it the most thats what I found and that is true for many women.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small Agree with the anthropology. I also think \textbf{sexual} pressure from men is nature's way for men to (unconsciously) test out women. If a \textbf{woman} says yes with no commitment, then the men generally lose longterm interest unless they are already hopelessly in love (but they will nevertheless be internally conflicted). In the jungle they would walk away. After all, the whole point is reproduction, and they are looking for a quality \textbf{woman}, and a good mother. They don't wish to devote resources to bringing up children with a girl that did not have the good sense/self-control/inner-strength to secure commitment. She isn't quality, she won't produce quality children, and she won't say no to her own children, to external threats, to tribal elders, or to her own self. They say that a person's success can be measured by how many difficult conversations they are willing to have. She won't be having difficult conversations unless it's forced on her.  A man hearing "no" is crucial to a longterm relationship. So then the other half of this is how women select men. I don't know much about that, but I can confirm that \textbf{promiscuous} women are of no longterm interest to most men.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Promiscuous, Sexual, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - Female sexuality, Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}4/200 & \cellcolor{green!27}2.0 \\  \hline

Families are far more geographically fragmented, and so there is less pressure from one's immediate family to remain married.

Even in marketing companies try to make a great impression on young customers so they are hooked for life and don't consider a competitor. Cellphone companies want you on a contract (or now pay out an expensive phone) or even a postpaid  plan so you are less likely to leave. Once people see choice they move on.  A \textbf{woman} that can get unlimited \textbf{sex} on Tinder is unlikely to be faithful.As  always your mileage will vary.  But I look at real world numbers. Birth rates (according to the gov't BTW) are below replenishment. Recent statistics came out. The \textbf{age} of marriage creeps up (some may say this is a good thing, but it also means MANY less are not getting married), less get married period, divorces are on the rise. MGTOW has thousands of ardent followers, would be unheard of even 20 years ago. I could see older guys but many of the comments are guys that aren't even 18. Women and men today are ADVERSARIAL due to feminism. Many don't understand exactly what that means. If a cop in the US pulls you over,  and you talk to him, he has to ignore and never repeat anything that could make you seem innocent. Anything that can be construed as guilt, even in the slightest, is used against you. When women take on a feminist role they operate the same way. Everything a guy does is held against them. Guys are afraid even to compliment women for ramifications. Feminist women take on the male \textbf{sexual} role and look for a conquest of partners. Their biology don't work that way, however. Women don't get off from porn the same way men do. It would almost be like men buying romance novels and getting worked up over them. It just don't really work that way. There are more non married adults than ever before. There is a major movement of alternative sexuality that does not favor procreation. There is something to see here. The bible and laws were created because humans have serious flaws. Those rules (premarital \textbf{sex}) were created to keep people in check, give them shame, etc. Now that is all gone.

Furthermore, "successful marriage" implies something that isn't really accurate. The absence of divorce should not in and of itself constitute a "success." I woukd contend that marriage endinf in divorce is much more successful than a marriage that endures abuse. With those caveats aside, the group's with the highest divorce rates are women with more than 10 \textbf{sexual} partners and women with 2 \textbf{sexual} partners prior to marriage. If there were a clear line of causality that more = divorce, the 3-9 cohort would reflect an increase compared to 2 partners.And while both 0 and 1 partner have lower divorce rates, this is readily explained by two factors: 1) virgin marriage is associated with religion which not only stigmatises pre-martial \textbf{sex} but also stigmatises divorce. The data show this religoous relationship to be accurate. Additionally, those who enter a marriage with children from a prior relationship have lower rates of reported marital satisfaction than those who do bit have children, and those with 1 previous partner were less likely to have a child.Overall, there is simply insufficient evidence available to conclude that the increase in partbers causes higher rates of divorce. It is just as likely abd perhaps even more likely that the characteristics which lead one to have more than 10 partners also affect marital stability.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small The \textbf{age} \textbf{old} tale of why men can sleep around and it's looked at as okay and not for women is explained VERY EASILY...Women: If a man who was wearing skin tight pants and a pink v neck came up to you said "Heeey giiirrllll" with a \textbf{limp} hand wave would YOU find that attractive? 99 of you will say NO. Why? Because that's looks FEMININE.In nature, almost all the time the male chases the female, HE gets on top of HER and has \textbf{sex} with her (if she allows it), but this is a MASCULINE behavior to chase and have \textbf{sex}.Sooooo ladies... when YOU a \textbf{woman} chases men, has a lot of \textbf{sex}.. YOU LOOK MASCULINE to men when you act that way and men find it very very unattractive.You can go ahead an write all the blog posts, YouTube videos, shut down traffic for protests to tell men to think differently, it will NEVER WORK. Men look at women who sleep around the same: They serve ONE purpose and ONE purpose ONLY.So if you are a \textbf{woman} and you sleep around AND people know you do... THIS is why you can't KEEP a man. No man takes you seriously.You can try to hide this ladies all you want but you are only damaging yourself, seeking out only the hottest, biggest dick, rich, etc and your standards will grow so high that you will never find a GOOD man who wants ONLY YOU, you will spend you life bitter because you can't get a hot, rich, big dick guy to STAY and the other "average" men aren't good enough anymore, on the eyes or in bed, you spoiled yourself and have no one else to blame but yourself.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Age, Limp, Old, Sex, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Age - General, Age - Over 65s, Gender - General, Physical Identity - Physical (and Mental) Impairments & \cellcolor{green!27}16/295 & \cellcolor{green!27}5.424 \\  \hline

To prove that is true, how do you explain how women are able to pick up on nice guys with pretty much 100 accuracy, and weed them out early, in search of the players and bad boys? Do you really think an intelligent person believes that you can be that great at recognizing nice guys, while being woefully unable to pickup on players and bad boys? It's BS. Men are onto your game. That's why the MGTOW guys, incels, and all of those guys are often harsh when they speak to you. They know you are not honest about what you like, and what turns you on. It's not nice guys.The reality is that the overwhelming majority of women want bad boy \textbf{sex}, but they don't want to be judged for it, so they pretend that they "don't know" that the guys they're dating/chasing are players or bad boys.

And yes, it is VERY EASY to know which guys are players and bad boys, and which ones are nice guys. Only an idiot wouldn't know.

You don't own him (especially if you are just his girlfriend...you have no right to stop him from sexing another \textbf{woman} if he wants). Am I saying that he should? No. I'm just acknowledging that you never own another human being. An alpha male will NEVER be with just one \textbf{woman}. Being with just one \textbf{woman} is the morally right thing to do, but it's unnatural for a male (the same is not true for a female, no matter how much society tries to make men and women equal). I'm not advocating it, but I recognize that it is what it is. Men aren't better than women, and women aren't better than men, but we're NOT equals, and never will be.

"Nice guys" sometimes aren't really nice well at least the fraudulent ones and some are pushovers. You can be a "nice guy" without being a pushover. Some guys get that part wrong. You're waiting on a woman's hand and foot, doing everything, never contradicting her, giving her everything she wants and never setting boundaries. This is what attracts the bitches of the female \textbf{race} the most. The "bitches" love this and will take advantage, which causes guys to become women hating assholes, when the "nice girls" did \textbf{nothing} to you.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small \@Anterea W so, you do realize that nice guys CHOOSE to be nice, and "pushovers", right? They know that they can dominate you (the \textbf{woman}) if they want to, but they make the conscious decision not to. You're also calling nice guys fraudulent, without recognizing that players and bad boys are also fraudulent. You do realize that ALL of these personas are acts, right? In reality, EVERY guy is ALL of these things...just some are a little more of one than the other at a given time. You exposed your disdain for nice guys by saying that a \textbf{woman} shouldn't date a nice guy just because he's nice (which I never said that they should), but a decent \textbf{woman} WOULD choose a nice guy over a player or a bad boy every time, if she's a sane, logical individual. This last comment exposed your hatred for nice guys again by calling them fraudulent. There's no bigger fraud than a player or bad boy. It's not even a real thing. It's a persona that guys create because they know that most women are attracted to it, and it's used to get a lot of cheap, easy \textbf{sex} from whores and slutty women. No guy is born a player, or bad boy. All men start out as nice guys when they are young, and life experiences (past failures, and seeing what works for other guys in society) causes them to adapt throughout life. I'm speaking from experience. I'm a seasoned guy who has been all 3 (nice guy, bad boy, and player) at different points in my life. When you put on both the player and bad boy persona, women almost trip over themselves trying to date and/or sleep with you, and when you recognize this, it makes you dislike them, because you realize how screwed up they are. They're basically bad people. When you're the nice guy, you tend to attract the sweet, nerdy girls, country girls, church girls (not the fake ones...the true ones), and girls raised in stable, two-parent homes.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!27}Sex, Woman & \cellcolor{green!27}Gender - General & \cellcolor{green!27}4/341 & \cellcolor{green!27}1.173 \\  \hline

That makes absolutely no sense, but most men have come to understand that women's brains work this way, which is why you have what you have now in the dating world.
