If she was raised in Japan, speaks the language, and  knows the culture then she's 100 Japanese.  The term 'Japanese ' represent a culture not a \textbf{race}.  If she became an American citizen after being raised in Japan, then she would be a \textbf{Black}, Japanese, American. She is \textbf{black} by \textbf{race}, Japanese by culture because that's where she was raised and she knows the language and customs. She would then be American through citizenship.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small Many of you are making comments ts about acceptance and generalizing about which groups are more accepting of mixed children. But I tell you, it really depends on the community and the individuals involved in each circumstance. I have observed that, in the US, being mixed makes one "other", but for most people it us a curiosity, or a relief because they believe it will be easier to identify with someone who is mixed than with someone from a different culture who MAY have a strong resentment to them based on race/cultural background. In Japan, it seems, being "other" is generally a bad thing.But I have heard of half \textbf{black} children in the US being bullied and called names by their \textbf{black} classmates and likewise from some of their white classmates. The lighter the mixed child, the more culturally "white" their peers tend to assume they should be. Though any mixture that is at all observed makes one "not white" and therefore "\textbf{black}" or "mexican" or "asian", always being called by the identity of the mixed group instead of the white majority.It is sad, but in the end it represents an important truth: we all want the same thing, to be accepted by our peers, and that results in the same fear of being rejected based on our immutable qualities. Sometimes that fear leads people to reject and mistreat others who are different on the basis of acceptance by the more homogeneous group, or because they are acting preemptively in self defense, despite the reality that they are acting as the aggressors.No one is defined, ultimately, purely by the color of their skin, but rather by the way they acted and the way they spoke. I hope that this comment speaks to some of you on this thread and encourages you to challenge your assumptions every day, knowing that what we assume does not always represent what is true.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!5}3/322 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.932 \\  \hline

Again, it's not \textbf{racism} to think she isn't a good representative of Japan. The Japanese are saying she's not a good representative of Japan because she doesn't look very Japanese and she promotes American values of diversity, which is the truth. Remember that she grew up in America for parts of her childhood.It's not the case that the Japanese have to except everyone in the world as a good representative of the \textbf{nation} of Japan.It seems like you're only seeing things from one side, that of diversity. I'm sure many people think this \textbf{woman} and the people supporting her are being the "asshole" because they're trying to impose a different representation and belief on the whole of Japan. It's like I said earlier, "I know I'd feel like a jerk if I went to Japan and represented the country as a person who didn't look very Japanese while at the same time telling them they should look less Japanese and be more diverse like America."  From the Washington Post article, "Japan's half-\textbf{black} Miss Universe says discrimination gives her ‚Äòextra motivation'"But Miyamoto told AFP that she was keenly aware of the lack of substantive \textbf{black} media personalities in her home country. She said she wanted to help transform Japan into a place where people won't worry anymore about their own racial backgrounds."'I want to start a revolution,' she told AFP. 'I can't change things overnight but in 100-200 years there will be very few pure Japanese left, so we have to start changing the way we think.'This \textbf{woman} wants to start a revolution and transform Japan to her liking, according her her own biased perspective, which isn't the perspective of the typical Japanese person. No wonder many Japanese are against her. In the article is seems she looks up to American supermodel Naomi Campbell for inspiration, not to any Japanese person.  I'm sure if you ask the Japanese people if being half \textbf{Black} American and promoting American values of diversity in an effort to make Japan less Japanese is the representative imagine of the Japanese \textbf{woman}, they'd say "no, it isn't."From hindustantimes article "Half-Japanese, half-\textbf{black}: Why new Miss Japan isn't 'Japanese enough'" "many of the highest-rated comments" about Miyamoto on the Japanese site GirlsChannel "said that they wanted a more Japanese contestant to represent Japan."\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Black, Nation, Racism, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black, Ethnicity - General, Gender - General, Nationality - General & \cellcolor{green!5}7/410 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.707 \\  \hline

High unemployment, low innovation and they're utterly stuck without any idea of how to renew their economy. They're stuck in a pattern and don't know how to renew and move forward. Also, very high hopelessness and suicide rate amongst young people. Obviously 18 hour school days isn't resulting in them coming up with the new Google or Space X. Majority of the population, In addition, China and India are dirt poor, and the sample of the students who take the IQ test is already the top students who have been vigorously educated. Why would all these countries not beat Europe and the US in innovation and economy if high IQ was so important?Btw, there is a lot of crime in South Korea, but crime looks different over there. Most drugs aren't criminalized. Prostitution is a huge problem, more than 1 million women participate and it generates about \$13 billion a year. Lot's of crimes related to that goes unreported.

  \cellcolor{green!5}\small \@N Bina Harry Potter is a book series. "Diversity" is tearing Europe and America apart. Anyone can see this. The problem isn't so much the presence of other \textbf{ethnic} groups, but the lack of cultural integration, and the problem of social incompatibility of certain populations. Japan and Korea being homogeneous is largely the reason for their success as societies. A society that is too diverse is one in which its ideas, principles, morals, ways of life, etc. are also too diverse, which means it cannot function realistically as a united civilization due to no one being able to agree with anyone else on anything, nor can it produce well since everyone's behavior (informed each by their unique cultural differences) is significantly different from everyone else's. This is the worst case scenario, obviously, but hypothetically, if my culture tells me, a \textbf{woman}, to speak my mind but someone else thinks women shouldn't have opinions over men due to their religion...I'm sorry, we won't be able to work together and we can't possibly benefit the community in which we both live. There is also the inherent collective personality characteristics of a culture, which, can work with compatible cultures, but with cultures that are too far apart, can't function. That's why for Japan, for example, Korean and Chinese or other East Asian immigrants likely wouldn't affect their society that much, since all these cultures were from a \textbf{common} root and share similarities already. A society is much like a business, if you get hired into the company, you better display the same qualities and attributes that made that company great in the first place. Otherwise, the business will be negatively affected.\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}Common, Ethnic, Woman & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - General, Gender - General, Social Class - Working class & \cellcolor{green!5}3/278 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.079 \\  \hline

People of color, faiths, \textbf{ethnicity} have made Korean entertainment into a community that shares the same interest. Korean music is influenced by western music. This is all \$\$, reputation, growth for a country. North Korea is one of the most homogeneous countries in the world, where has it gotten compared to the South?

So when ever we see those features we think, negroid instead of other races of people who share the same features. Not if she were Japanese and white, here wider nose and fuller lips would make since.

  \cellcolor{green!27}\small +Jazir Kamal The second largest land empire in the world was the Mongolian, which included parts of white Europe. They were also responsible for possibly the greatest atrocity of the Late Middle Ages in the Siege of Baghdad.The most prolific and longest running slave trade in history was the Arab Slave Trade, which again included white Europeans from the Mediterranean and even in one instance as far north as Iceland. Along with, obviously, Africans, Asians, and people from all over the world. The Arab Slave Trade also started 800 years before the European-run Atlantic Slave Trade and lasted an additional 100 years after it had ended.Umayyad caliphate conquered the Iberian Peninsula and they and subsequent Muslim civilizations colonized and ruled white European land for 500 years, 700 until they were fully expelled (this is twice as long as the entire extent of the British Empire). The Ottomans did the same thing to the Balkan Peninsula for almost 400 years.Not only are white people by no stretch of the imagination responsible for the "majority" of \textbf{racist} acts or interracial atrocities, but there has also been a disturbing amount of atrocities committed by the Arab world against the rest of the world, in particular whites, that \textbf{nobody} seems too concerned about.

Because, here you have to either lose your cultural identity and become white-washed, or if you even have a drop of \textbf{African} blood in you, you are forced by one group to identify yourself as "\textbf{black}", "\textbf{African}-American" (and deny your white ancestry all together, even if that side of family was not "slave owners"), or they will think you are a sell-out, an "Oreo", etc. Why can't people identify themselves as being "mixed" and be proud?\normalsize   & \cellcolor{green!5}African, Black & \cellcolor{green!5}Ethnicity - Black & \cellcolor{green!5}2/141 & \cellcolor{green!5}1.418 \\  \hline

That`s why her remark about \textbf{racism} in Japan shocked and made me sad. Whether we like it or not, Japan is in a transitional period from highly homogenious society to more multiracial and multicultural \textbf{nation}. Judging from what`s going on in Europe, Japan should not accept huge number of ¬†immigrants right now, but we should be more generous to people with foreign origin as far as they¬† respect our culture, language and Japanese society as a whole.

They do not like taking on responsibility and many punish their own seed because they don't want to deal with monogamy. That's not a cultural issue?

A \textbf{Black} American in Queens will have a different meaning to \textbf{Black} culture than a \textbf{Black} American in Texas. There may be some overlap, but culture is an extensive term.
